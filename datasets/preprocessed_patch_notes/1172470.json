        "content": "OVERVIEW There s no better way to kick off year seven of than upping the heat of. heavy hitters that have been in the background a bit too long make their way center stage with updates worthy of Predators, and revamped perks raise up the rest of the Assault Class. No weapon is a bad weapon with buffs across the board for every piece that you can get your hands on. This meta is cooking and it s safe to say that this anniversary season flips the season of Support to of aggression. Coupled with some updates for Armor and Helmets, greater access to weapons with the Arsenals, and reduced visual clutter and has never been faster. It s a whole ready to fight. LEGEND BUFFS ASH Ash sees a number of improvements this season to her Arc Snare and Phase Breach to make them more effective and reliable. Her snare change lets her snag targets against the edge of the tether more often. Her Ult goes farther, travels faster, and endpoint detection has improved to make the targeting stickier and less prone to accidental bad snapping. The big change for Ash is her passive Predator Pursuit. This grants her an omnidirectional her to close the gap on a tethered target or evade swiftly in a skirmish. With these, Ash is set to become the Predator she was always meant to be. BALLISTIC Ballistic sees some of his favorite upgrades, the extra charge and sling levelling, integrated into his base kit, giving him more utility and versatility in the early. A Level upgrade allows him to double his Whistler charges, opening up his utility and crowd control potential immensely. Tempest, his Ult, now grants a speed him a frightening when he and his bare down on you. But the big guns? Ballistic sling can now carry crate weapons, which can spool with infinite ammo when Tempest is active. In Takeover, Ballistic may very well relive his glory days. ASSAULT CLASS PERKS Assault are walking arsenals forged in combat and always ready for a fight. Their abilities grant them incredible combat utility that helps disrupt enemies, threaten their positions, or give them openings to. These are enhanced with perks that let them worry less about their weapon economy, bring more explosive power to the table, and give them the combat edge to capitalize on of core moments in any combat shield break. Combat Reserve Carry extra ammo per ammo stack Have slots in inventory Retain access to Red Extended Supply Bins Stowed Reload stowed weapons automatically reload after Surge breaking an enemy s shields grants a speed burst, fast reloads, and highlights the target enemy for WEAPON BUFFS, HELMETS AND ARMOR Over the years, has evolved in so many ways to provide players with more agency and deeper options for how to, survive, and express their skill. Through that evolution, the benchmark damage for our weapons has stayed stable, but has grown stale. We want to make sure the nuanced flow of combat remains tight and weapons are lethal in order to provide exciting gameplay options. Royales are all about strategy and timing. These are the mechanisms to success, but strategy goes right out the window if encounters are taking too long to resolve and you dealing with your,, or even party. This latest suite of is designed to keep you in the drivers seat by providing the tools to resolve conflicts faster, getting you back to if the party is coming and not when. In addition to sweeping weapon buffs, we have taken a look at the defensive side of loot in with some hefty streamlining. Low tier Helmets white, blue, and purple have been, and rare high value Helmets that provide meaningful gameplay perks have been in their place. As for Armor, you will no longer level into red tier shields at Level but will instead be capped at Level shields. However, red shields will still be available in the form of the Mythic Armor Upgrade Helmet. MUZZLE FLASH Visual clutter in gunfights is no joke. In an attempt to combat this, we ve reduced the effects and particles you see when you fire your weapon. We believe this balances increased visual clarity while still selling the impact and fantasy of firing our weapons. All weapons muzzle flashes have been updated less visual noise over the line of sight sparks, smoke, glows etc kept below line of sight Reduced size of muzzle flashes Optimized particle count Cleaned noise from shells ejects Cleaned lingering elements smoke, sparks, etc Light toned down to avoid flickering on weapons and environment models For remaining notes, please check out our blog here",

        "content": "Last year we made a commitment to you that we were going to continue to grow our communications and give you additional development insight. For our first dev blog of, we re sharing progress on the last hot topics we covered and matchmaking. We touched on both of these in our Dev video that launched today, but we wanted to give a written overview as well. You already know that is an ever evolving process, but we wanted to you with the latest on teaming, botting, and actioning your reports. We chatted about matchmaking just ahead of the holidays, but there s so much more to catch you up on including features in the works. Here s a TLDR of what we re covering in today s dev Recent efforts against teaming including recent action being taken on accounts across all platforms and the removal of million ranked points An on our progress against botting including a brand machine learning model Report Feedback a feature that we re investigating to provide additional insight into the report you sent Brief touch base around a recently resolved incident that saw some accounts become compromised Matchmaking A sneak peek of features coming in the not so distant future Unranked Skill Display, seeding skill values, and lessening Ranked resets Looking at some and upcoming tests npc Bots, preferential matchmaking solos premades, and queue time adjustments Sharing some ongoing conversations for transparency Ranked premade restrictions, Ranked placement matches and skill difference and scoring Catch up before you jump in with our previous matchmaking and blogs, and keep an eye out on our social channels for more continual updates such as the Linux blockage results or adjustments to matchmaking. and integrity will always be a top priority for us and the fight continues as we work to put in safeguards and evolve our systems to stop and get ahead of cheaters. This is another topic that we ll share updates on as often as we can, whether it s through social updates or blogs. Today we re sharing some advances we ve made in combating teaming and botting, and an upcoming feature to better your reporting experience. TEAMING While is a at its core, it s not a s. If you ve not encountered this before, teaming is when multiple teams collude during a match for a shared goal. For those that have experienced this in the past, you might ve noticed a decrease over the last few months. We ve actively been targeting this negative behaviour in Ranked modes from multiple angles, including rolling out automated teaming detection algorithms, swifter and more severe punishments, and stripping any ranked points from offenders. These efforts have led to action being taken on accounts across all platforms, including the removal of million ranked points, and we ve seen a decrease in teaming thanks to this. We ll continue to this exploitative practice and take appropriate action against bad actors. Teaming has no place in. BOTTING There has been a recent increase in bots that ve been circumventing our existing security measures and we re actively working on addressing this. We ve created a brand machine learning model that not only detects this generation of bots, but was built to be more to combat future variants and evolutions. At the time of writing this, our early reviews have found this model to be incredibly accurate with low false negatives and we re on track to have this in the live by the time you re reading this. Encountering bots these in your sessions is not only frustrating, but it muddies the pool. Often these accounts are being used for various malicious purposes after they ve been levelled up including cheating and harassment. Our work here is not done, but we expect another decrease in cheaters and an overall improved experience by continuing to reduce these bots. REPORT FEEDBACK Knowing your report against a cheater has been effective has been long requested by our community. We re still in early stages, but we can share that this is something that we re investigating. Look for an with more details about this potential feature in the future. Please continue to send your has the potential to make an impact If you re unable to report, you can report players via EA Help For concerns regarding vulnerabilities or, report via our CVD program RECENTLY COMPROMISED ACCOUNTS Towards the end of January, a few high profile pro and creator accounts became compromised. While this has since been addressed, we want to share that we discovered and resolved exploits that contributed to this exploit targeted a party privacy status that impacted custom matches, and the other capitalized on our handshake of which we are confident are fixed and secured. We thank those impacted for flagging this and working with us to get this rectified as quickly as possible so that they could get back into the Outlands. MATCHMAKING Our last dev blog provided a good baseline which we can use to focus on what s coming next, things that we want to test, and ongoing conversations. The has been hard at work to act on what we ve been hearing from the community of players as well as our own data. COMING SOON Some of what we re sharing today is still in progress and may change before it goes live, but here s a sneak peek at some features coming in the future. UNRANKED SKILL DISPLAY Skill Display in Ranked has been an asset and we ve seen the impact it has had on your matches, strategizing, and potential flagging of issues. Since it s seen such success in Ranked, we ll be rolling out a version for Trios BR at the start of the next season. Its purpose is the same as its Ranked variant to provide context on where your squad s skill level sits within the rest of the lobby. Unranked Skill Display will look a little different as there isn t a visible skill value for players in pubs. Here s what you can expect from this feature How wide the skill is for the entire lobby Where the bookends of the lobby skill sit in the overall skill distribution of all players in this match Your squad s skill in the context of both the lobby and the overall Note check out the full blog on for examples taken from internal testing. thing that isn t here that is in the Ranked Display is the number of squads throughout the distribution. We had an early version that included this, but it was not easy to at a glance. We ll be releasing a more simplified version to start with while we continue to iterate. SEEDING SKILL VALUES How players start with modes and LTMs has varied in the past, but it ll soon have a more consistent approach and result your starting skill value when playing a mode for the first time will be influenced by your skill value in other modes. Modes that you ve played before including returning LTMs will already have your match history to work with. Your starting skill value will be more elastic than your other skill values, meaning that it can change more quickly and with a larger swing based on your performance. It will stabilize over a number of matches and your matches will get more consistent. TLDR the launch of a mode will be less chaotic in terms of skill mixing. Now all players will have a starting skill value to match from and they should start to be paired with players from their very first match. This will be coming to unranked matches first, but will quickly be followed by a solution that allows matchmaking to seed players into their correct Rank Tier based on their performance in other modes. LESSENING RANKED RESETS On the topic of skill mixing, this happens the most at the start of each Ranked season and each split. We ve seen a good amount of chatter about the dislike of both seasonal RP and split resets, and this is an active conversation for us. For the near future, we will be tuning the reset values and reset placements to reduce skill mixing even more. This should help reduce skill mixing for players that participated in the previous season, but doesn t prevent Ranked players from climbing. This is just step we re taking to reduce skill mixing and more are on the way. TESTING These next items are either in testing or will be soon and we ll aim to share some results and decisions for future in a future dev blog. Note the dates of these tests haven t and won t be published to avoid outside influence, but we ll circle back and share after our internal analysis is done. BOTS NPC Bot created an approachable way to build your skills and onboard with a squad, but when you re ready for Unranked pubs you re thrown into the thick of it. It s clear that you re looking for tighter and fairer matches, especially those who are newer and players. We ve started testing something that we think will not only help developing players, but deliver on the lobbies you ve been looking for. We ve slowly been introducing a small and deliberate amount of npc bots, Bots, into public lobbies. These bots only deploy as opponents and will be a full squad your squad will not be filled. We want players to have fun playing, and we see this as a potential path to deliver more of that, but we didn t want to just drop them on you. Enemy bots don t always create the best experience, so it s worth repeating that this is a test. We ll be monitoring and measuring for impact in a few areas decreasing skill width, decreasing overall queue wait times, and whether or not this helps players increase their sense and combat effectiveness. We hope to have enough data for next steps by, so that we can report back and share updates and if we can leverage these Bots for increased health in the future. PREFERENTIAL MM SOLOS VS PREMADES A desire for premades to only against premades and solos to only against solos is something we ve frequently heard, but a full splitting of the queues isn t a possibility that we re going to pursue in the near future. We need to keep premade squads and solo queueing players together to maintain healthy queue populations and ensure that matchmaking quality isn t compromised. It s worth calling out that there would be a significant impact to queue times in order for this change to be felt by players and reach the level of desired impact. With that in mind, we re going to run a lot of testing to understand the impact of adding preferential matchmaking criteria based on premade solo. The goal of this is for the matchmaking system to take into consideration premade solo queuers, and attempt to match them together as much as possible within the acceptable level of impact to queue times and skill width. We re looking forward to digging into what is possible and feasible with this as it s of the most requested matchmaking. QUEUE TIME ADJUSTMENTS At the start of From the Rift, we adjusted how much time CWMM takes to expand the search for players in both Unranked and Ranked BR matches. While this increased wait times, it had the desired positive effect of making matches tighter overall, meaning more encounters with players. This led to more damage output and kills per, and we believe that these measurements roughly translate to both fun and fairness for the majority of players. While this has had some success, we ll be continuing to experiment and optimize maximum wait times for various skill bands in order to increase match tightness. We ve not yet found the sweet spot for work needs to be done. ONGOING CONVERSATIONS These next topics we re going to cover are ones that are hot both internally and externally. We re just starting to formulate tests to help us validate our ideas on each and we ll hopefully have more to share once they re out of the investigating phase. RANKED PREMADE RESTRICTIONS With the Ranked Skill Display showing that yes, sometimes a Silver can be in the same lobby as a Master, it s less clear that this is partially due to premade squads allowing players within Tiers of each other. A Silver can pair with a Platinum, and they can then get pulled into a Diamond lobby which allows Masters including Preds. Too many ranks for lobby. We could further restrict premades to reduce the width of matches caused by premade squads, but this would limit who could together in its current form. We re not a big fan of that route as this is a and forming squads with your friends to compete is something we d to see more of. This needs the most cooking time, and we are going to keep talking about other solutions to this specific problem. RETURN OF RANKED PLACEMENT MATCHES We want players having fun as quickly as possible and aspect of that is playing against players of similar skill. Previously, we had implemented placement matches where players would matches and then be placed into their starting Division and Tier for that Ranked season. We re looking to return to a version of this system as it s both easy to understand, and effective at detecting and properly placing players even before their first official Ranked match. This system will leverage skill seeding to assist in each s placement based on past performance in other modes, and will rely on Ranked Placement Match performance to influence their starting position. SKILL DIFFERENCE AND SCORING This is a fairly topic of discussion for us and it s an interesting how can we leverage scoring outcomes to make the match more fair when there s wider skill mixing in a lobby. broad example would be if the least skilled in the lobby got killed by the highest skilled in the lobby, would they lose less RP? And vice versa, would they get a major bonus to RP or XP if unranked if the opposite occurred? Scoring and balance is a super delicate topic and requires a lot of work even before being ready for testing. Right now, the feedback we re hearing is that it is very much not worth the risk of being in matches with players. While we are doing many things to actively reduce skill mixing, there will always need to be some level of mixing and want to explore options to make it more fair. SEE YOU ON THE DROPSHIP We re committed to continuing the conversation with you, our community, and we re reiterating that promise now in. should be fun and competitive without any loss to the integrity of the, and this is just the beginning of how we ll be focusing on the issues that are impacting your experience. Look forward to more of these updates as we continue to action this commitment while implementing, running tests on community requests, and improving on your experience. Cheers for your patience and feedback, and we ll see you in Takeover.",

Mastiff Aim down sights blast pattern tightening reduced Blast Pattern size increased Increased the time before the Mastiff is ready to fire when raising Raise and lower times slightly increased Dev Note The Mastiff has proven particularly this season and its consistency at range is a big part of that.

Peacekeeper Choke speed significantly increased Increased projectile speed Dev Note When it comes to good range shotguns we want the Peacekeeper s choked shot to be the main talking point so we re speeding it up and making the projectiles fly faster.

        "content": "Matchmaking is not only a core part of, but it s an important topic for both our community and our development. For us, good matchmaking means putting you in a squad with players of a similar skill, in a lobby with squads within your skill range, where everyone has a shot to come out on top. You may win some, you may lose some, but it is a system that should provide a variety of outcomes with each encounter. Matchmaking is complex and has a lot of variables to account for that going into assessing a s skill we don t rely on KDR Ratio as it doesn t fully reflect the complexity of what skilled looks in a. We know that there s room to improve on our matchmaking and we re going to. A primary goal for us moving forward is to grow the conversation with our community on how our system works, why it works the way it does, and what we re working on to better your experience. When we re all on the same page about where we are now, we can then move the conversation forward quickly and towards the outcomes we all that consistently feel both fair and fun. We are committed to focusing on matchmaking every season, continuing the conversation with you in the coming seasons, and promising that this is a priority for. Here s a TLDR of what we covering today Our current tech systems the big since our last. We ve introduced Continuous Window Matchmaking a dynamic system that s capable of predicting and adapting to the current live population. This has increased our consistency during both natural periods of lower and higher server populations. Bespoke to modes we made to how we approach measuring and using a value for a s skill, and each mode is measured differently. We don t rely on KDR as that s not fully reflective of how we measure success and skill in a. Recent improvements Ranked Skill Display. This launched with From the Rift and has become a tangible means for players to understand the range of ranks they re seeing in the lobby. Some of these are due to squads, but some screenshots have helped us with investigations and adjustments. Working with your feedback we share answers to some of the most commented pieces of feedback. OUR CURRENT TECH SYSTEMS There are major since our last matchmaking that we want to share Introduction of Continuous Window Matchmaking CWMM Bespoke to modes, including Ranked As population shrinks, CWMM widens the skill levels that are allowed into a match. It does this predictively based on live populations, striking a balance between queue wait times and lobby skill width. CWMM has limits in how far and quickly it s allowed to adapt, which are set as a result of continued analysis and assessment. This means that we can effectively cap both the time a will wait in queue and how wide the skill can be in any given lobby these are the rails we establish for the system to work within. From metas to playstyles to growing skills, no seasons are alike for each. We re constantly evaluating and adjusting those data rails to keep the majority of matchmaking experiences within our desired design goals. All modes make use of CWMM in order to match players with the closest skill values possible, though how we determine the skill value can be different depending on the mode. BESPOKE MATCHMAKING TO MODES As CWMM came online, we made to how we approach measuring and using a value for a s skill. This skill measurement is different between modes, as is how we decide to the skill value based on a s performance. DAMAGE MODEL Measuring damage output is a reliable way to determine skill when it s done over a number of matches. It s a very good system for modes that have a smaller number of teams and players as damage output is more consistent. All players currently start with a matchmaking skill value of for their very first match of a mode that uses this model. Then the plays the match, hopefully deals damage, and then their skill value updates once the match is completed. The skill value consists of parts Average damage done by players historically, which makes up the majority of the overall value Damage from your last match, which makes up a small part of the value With only a small part coming from your most recent match, the overall skill value becomes fairly stable over a number of matches. This allows exceptional matches to change the outcome more significantly, but not to the point of wild swings. The Damage Model skill value is used when matching in Mixtape each Mixtape mode has an independent skill value and certain LTMs. MATCHMAKING RATING MMR MODEL Over time, the determined that the damage model could be improved upon as Royales have more nuance to being skilled than pure damage output. A set of criteria were developed to establish skill values and when players would get updates to their overall skill value. For all BR modes, an to your MMR is triggered when your squad knocks or kills a in another squad. Both squads are then flagged for a skill because the eliminated squad is likely to leave the match after elimination. We want to make sure that you can jump right back into another with an updated skill value for your next match. What determines the magnitude of your skill change is your relative placement in a match compared to the teams you had a significant encounter with knock or kill and the skill of the other squad. MMR is a value that falls within a fairly granular range. This is why CWMM works so well it starts grabbing those with the closest values of skill when trying to fill a lobby. Matches based on skill will result in fairer when skill values are specific and granular. It s a simple system that works effectively and captures what we think are the most important measures of skill in, surviving and high placement. This model is used in all BR modes except for Ranked. RP MODEL For Ranked matches, a s Ranked Points RP value is used for matching players. This was reimplemented in Season as a response to dissatisfaction of being a high MMR fighting against other high MMR players as MM tries to match closest skill value, but in a low rank tier lobby Bronze. This combo of using MMR for matching while using RP to determine the progression for players broke the existing expectation that Bronze lobbies should be easy and Masters lobbies should be In response, we linked RP and skill, and we are now using RP for matchmaking. There is a loose correlation between actual skill as measured in MMR and a s RP value. This works fine when a has plateaued in their seasonal Ranked journey. when their skill value has stabilized for the season, but that isn t always the case. This becomes challenging when a high skill starts their Ranked journey at an RP of, and they re matching mostly with other players that have a very low RP value. That will quickly stomp their way to higher ranks and make the experience less enjoyable for those getting stomped. It gives the perception that matchmaking is totally broken, and lowers those players trust in and their desire to keep playing. In the past few seasons, the RP Reset has been adjusted in an attempt to keep players together at the start of the season, reducing. We are Provisional Matches as a possible solution to initial Division and Tier placement, preventing some of that initial skill mixing while making it harder for smurf accounts. As you may know, your RP value gets updated when you finish each match. That updated value is what is used for your next match, so keep requeuing and hit your best tier! RECENT IMPROVEMENTS If you haven t been in a Ranked match yet this season, Skill Display shows a live display of rank tiers for each will be shown at the bottom of the screen as the lobby fills for each Ranked match. This was introduced not only for transparency into your upcoming match, but to build trust around matchmaking and ensure that it s working as intended. Bonus it has given you a tangible way to capture and show us anything that is not balanced. Cheers for sending those through! While some of the screenshots have been due to matchmaking, some haven t been and that s led to an array of actions from slight tweaks to going back to the drawing board. We ve some additional initiatives in the works that tap into that same goal of building trust, especially around consistently fun and fair matchmaking. So heads up we re going to be flexing and straining some of the existing systems and how things have historically worked. There may be some bumps in the road as we find the right fit, but we ll keep you informed and ensure that our align with the community. WORKING WITH YOUR FEEDBACK Your feedback is a big part of that process and we often look at ways to act on it. Here s some comments that we ve seen the most and some insights on each of them Unexpected High Skill Players there s tier in my lobby Ranked Tiers And Matchmaking each Ranked tier should only be matched against itself Squadmate Matching my squadmates are terrible Premades Solo Queuing I consistently get rolled by premades as a solo queuer UNEXPECTED HIGH SKILL PLAYERS This is the most common piece of feedback in regards to why matchmaking is perceived as unfair. You re chilling in Diamond IV with your squad and what looks a full of players with Pred badges and pops up as the Champion squad. What if you re playing pub matches or Mixtape and see the same thing? You don t have the context of anyone rank to help understand how skilled these players are in comparison to you and everyone else in the lobby. This is further complicated by a decent percentage of our current players having reached Masters at some point in their past yes, even outside of Season, which means they have the badges and stats to prove it. There s nothing wrong with showing off on your Legend Banner, but that doesn t always reflect their current seasonal performance. It often takes time for players who have been away for a while for their skills to get back into the groove after jumping in. There are three major reasons that you re seeing highly decorated and highly skilled players in your lobby Their current skill rating is close enough to yours for the matchmaker to put you in the same lobby You re in a lobby in a premade squad with a higher ranked than yourself You re playing in a low population queue The solution to the first is something that we have been actively tuning and are getting more aggressive with by prioritizing close skill matches over queue time. This season s will create a longer average wait time compared to last season in favor of getting the lobby to be of closer skill as well as some harder limits on which ranks can be matched together. We are hoping the meets with the expectation of our most competitive players and will be worth it. We are constantly monitoring the state of matchmaking, and this will be no exception. We are always ready and willing to make live adjustments if matchmaking times are worse than expected. The problem of premade squads is something that we try to address in Ranked by restricting squads to be within rank tiers of each other, but matching based on the highest RP value in the squad. This is meant to help and boosting. In Unranked BR matches, we increase the effective skill value of the squad, to slightly the inherent bonus we believe premade squads have. We are looking at adjusting these values up even more and measuring the impact for solo queue players. While low populations due to time of day or region is something we can not directly control, we re looking at ways to allow more players to together regardless of time or region, and we should have more to share on that topic in the future. RANKED TIERS AND MATCHMAKING Similar to the last topic, we ve seen the feedback around limiting matchmaking by ranks or tighter ranges of RP. We touched on this in our continuous matchmaking section as well with Our current matchmaking system treats all players at RP as Masters tier players. Players at this level and above are minimal, so we have to match them all together and consider them to be at the same skill level for the purposes of matchmaking. We allow for RP to continue to be gained to allow for Masters players to continue to compete for Predator, but it s important to note that Pred isn t a ranked tier on its own. It s a title that we give to the top Masters Ranked players on each platform. That said, we are continuing to balance time to find a match how wide the match can be in terms of included Ranks in your lobby. At the time of this blog, the Ranked matchmaking system allows for the following maximum using Diamond Divisions as the example All Divisions of Diamond can match up to Masters and therefore Preds Diamond IV can match down to Platinum IV Diamond III can match down to Platinum III Diamond II can match down to Platinum II Diamond I can match down to Platinum I This doesn t account for premades though. Ranked premade squad members are allowed to be within tiers of each other, but they ll get matched based off the highest rank in the squad. This can result in the above restrictions appearing broken as the effective lowest rank that could be matched is now tiers lower via a premade squad. That said, this is the maximum that the matchmaker will try to match to. It will always try to match the exact Ranked tier if enough players of that tier are actively queuing in your region and on your platform. To continue with our Diamond example, it currently takes about minutes for matches to expand to the maximum in the current configuration. SQUADMATE MATCHING How squadmates are chosen by the matchmaker was covered in the previous blog, and it hasn t changed since then. TLDR your squadmates are chosen based on closest skill value matching. Of course, if the overall skill width in the lobby is very wide then there may be a gap between teammates. When we examine some cases of bad matchmaking it becomes clear that a core contributing problem is conflicting motivations playstyles. You may want to push everything, but your squadmate plays more passively. Or you may want to complete sniper challenges, but your squadmate is already sniping and won t give it up. There are so many individual styles of and motivations that some level of incompatibility is inevitable. The best thing we can recommend here is to keep communicating, flex when possible, and remember that we re all just looking for that next The part of this gets improved with overall match width tuning. If there are narrower skill gaps for the entire lobby, your squadmates are going to be very very close to your skill level. Then it ll be up to you to figure out if you all want to in the same way. PREMADES SOLO QUEUING It was mentioned above, but worth restating we give premade squads an effective skill value increase for matchmaking, so they match into higher skilled lobbies. This is to compensate for the inherent benefit of being in a lobby with someone that you ve presumably played with before and likely have some level of communication and coordination with. We have experimented with preferential matchmaking of solos with solos and premades with premades, but the results weren t as as you might expect. This is something that we ll be testing again in the future to hopefully better understand the actual impact and reaction from players. CONCLUSION should be fun, but a competitive and challenging experience. Both consistently winning and consistently losing is bad for enjoyment, and the goal is always an optimal experience. We want players to be able to hone their skills and come out stronger as a result. In order for that to happen, there needs to be some degree of challenge for players which is partially where matchmaking comes in, but it s a delicate balance. has some of the most skilled and competitive players out there today. We re working to build up the trust in our systems and design approach, and you can expect to see a focus on that goal via matchmaking.

There is currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Deck via Linux. Decision making process The openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive for cheaters and cheat developers. Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the for a relatively small platform. There are cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention. We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players. This ultimately brought us to our decision today. Next steps To eliminate this cheat vector, we have made the decision to prevent access to the for Linux users. This means that will be unplayable immediately for those running this operating system. Playing on handhelds, such as the Deck, is still possible if the user opts to install Windows. To clarify, this will not impact users who via on Windows or other supported platforms. Thanks for everyone s continual support and we look forward to sharing future updates! This is only a part of our ongoing efforts towards s. We are continually expanding and refining our detection and banning capabilities globally. Keep an eye out for more news to come in the future. Please continue to report cheaters using the designated tools and channels. Your reports are helpful and matter to us and continues to be a top priority for us.

While we work daily to stamp it out and get ahead of the next exploit or cheating evolution, it s worth noting that this will never end. We ve been active in this fight, but we haven t been as successful as we ve needed to be. So we re stepping things up in multiple areas, including aiming to deliver noticeable improvements over time to protect the integrity of our. It may without saying, but we can t share every detail.

MAP This map was designed to offer players a fresh and innovative experience. While it retains the core elements that define a great map, we pushed the boundaries by incorporating numerous buildings, emphasizing verticality, and creating varied landscapes. These ensure some of the most diverse fights and locations across the map. the full breakdown of this latest map addition in our Welcome to blog here. SHOCKWAVE MAP ROTATION The following maps will be available in Pubs and Ranked for the first half of this season Broken Moon Storm Point As an introduction to our newest map, will be the dedicated featured map for a limited time. Let the energy of the neon lights energize your squad with each Pub match for the first week and each Ranked match for the first hours of the season. CONTROLLER RECON CLASS PERKS This season we re beginning a much more intentional push on what classes mean to the core of the by bringing tactical class passives to the Controller and Recon classes. Both will continue to bring strategic depth to their squad via interactions with Survey Beacons and Ring Consoles, but they ll now have intrinsic power that better supports their role on the. CONTROLLER CLASS CLASS PERK Zone Overcharge Controller now have extra shield capacity when playing in zone The Zone automatically grants an overcharge of shield capacity This capacity is permanent while the remains in zone white ring area on the map Overcharge is lost when leaving zone after delay Overcharge can be healed with cells, batteries and abilities while in zone If a enters the zone at full shields, the overcharge pip will fill automatically If a acquires a shield core that overcharges beyond this extra zone capacity, that additional overcharge will still drain normally but the zone overcharge will remain Zone Overcharge will never enhance Legend Armor beyond maximum red capacity QUALITY OF LIFE Remote Controller can now remotely their undamaged Tacticals by looking back at them and pressing a button Additionally, if the abandons the area, they will prompted to recover ALL possible objects Remotely recovering these objects will restore the Tactical charge Dev Note Controller are at their best when playing for zone position. This season, we re rewarding that behavior in who don t want to skim the edges of hunting for EVO, and instead allow them to maintain an equal footing on their armor when playing to their strengths. Gaining knowledge of the next ring and keeping a good position will be important to maintaining this advantage. Additionally, we noticed that many newer players to the Controller Class struggle with management of their Tacticals. This takes a step towards making it more desirable to experiment with traps or to feel more comfortable setting up shop with less worry about having to abandon your entire setup to move to a slightly better building. We want Controller players to with their kit more freely and not have to do extra running around to recycle charges or feel locked into their setup if they have to move. RECON CLASS CLASS PERK Threat Vision Recon now gain threat vision when aiming down sights Threat vision will highlight enemies that the character has Line of Sight to whenever using ADS aim down sights This ability will not work through walls or smoke, and it s limited in range by the type of scope or zoom range of an ability SURVEY BEACONS Faster to use was Shortened range of was scanning the entire map No longer randomly distributed and all will now be turned on with every map Scanning now grants EVO was EVO Now pulses times over, with each pulse taking a snapshot of enemies in range for Now release a large scan wave that players can spot to identify an activated beacon enemies no longer receive a scan message Enemies scanned will display along the edges of the even if not in Dev Note Recon are defined as who are about Enemy Intel Tracking which is a core part of each character s pattern, but to date, the only class benefit was something players had to seek out via Survey Beacons. We re ratcheting up the scouting role for Recon this season and putting class power directly into their hands. With ADS Threat Vision, these characters are now adept at spotting distant targets for their, and now innately do something that no other class can. The to Survey Beacons should allow players to make them a more tactical part of their, rather than just a strategic element. The full map scan was only useful to a small number of high level players, and often the scan messaging would turn your into a magnet for others to hunt. Now, being more frequent, faster to use, and giving more intel for longer makes it easier to use the beacons with confidence and hunt in the immediate area or note secure paths out of a POI for rotation. STAT TRACKERS We made a huge quality of life upgrade to Stat Trackers and are separating out the Stat and the Art. You now be able to set these on your Legend Banner Cards separately. The Art on your trackers have been made universal, which means they can be applied to any Legend Banner Card.

We ve made the call to eliminate it from all weapons and most Legend abilities. However there are some Legend abilities that do benefit from the feedback dunking on someone with a Newcastle ult. We ll keep an eye on abilities that may need additional feedback as we see how this change affects the. Loot Bin Reset Starting with Shockwave, all loot bins will close and reroll their loot with a significantly increased chance at high tier and rare loot at the point of the match.

By reducing the amount of high tier loot in the early players will be fighting on more even terms. To compensate for this reduction, Loot Bin Reset improves the overall quality of loot in the world which should provide a much smoother transition to end power.

TAKEOVER SOLOS Well, well, Solos is coming back after all! Replacing Duos from the beginning of the season, take on the Outlands by yourself in this revamped variant. We ve taken aspects of some of our most popular modes and integrated them to keep things interesting use your Sense to detect nearby enemies, tear things up with weapons and attachments, and keep the fight going with auto heal and Second Chance mechanics. We get you want to drop hot and heavy without having to carry the squad. It s every Legend for now. Solos Takeover is live May, to June,. LEGEND ALTER When Alter emerged from her dimension into another with her past held close to the chest, she had only things her interdimensional traveling Void tech, and a desire to have fun. She did what she wanted when she wanted, never needing to stick around for the consequences of her actions. Morality and responsibility were things of the past as Alter traveled throughout different realities, drawn to worlds on the edge of complete destruction. Whether something devastating was already happening or she helped usher in the apocalypse herself, Alter was always there to watch whatever catastrophe ensued. She loved seeing worlds end and seeing the true nature of the people come out within the chaos. However, in some ruined dimensions, there was a common denominator that intrigued that would lead her to witness the grandest apocalypse of all. Seeking out the next world it would condemn, Alter has landed in ours, ready to do what s necessary to see her wish fulfilled. PASSIVE GIFT FROM THE RIFT Alter can see and remotely interact with nearby death boxes to claim a single item. While she can not take shield cores through the void, any other prize can be snatched from afar. TACTICAL VOID PASSAGE Alter fires a void blast from her tail that shatters against a surface to open a dimensional gateway through from side to the other for a short time. Crossing through the portal is instantaneous, and can be done from either direction, but travelers will remain phased briefly after exiting. The angle of this shot determines what surface the exit will open on and can be used to open passages through ceilings and ledges, allowing Alter to place her passages creatively through the environment. ULTIMATE VOID NEXUS Alter can deploy a Void Nexus that allies can remotely interact with to open a phase tunnel back to that point. When a tunnel is opened, that will phase walk from their location to the Void Nexus and leave behind a portal that any can follow through. The Nexus can be used even while downed, and it is an incredible way for Alter and her squad to regroup to a position of power for a reset, provided interlopers do not ARTIFACTS The pantheon of Artifacts is expanding. Check out our dedicated blog for all things Artifacts including lore connections and customizations. MAP BROKEN MOON Our goals for the Upheaval were to bring a combat experience throughout Broken Moon and within the POIs, while changing the identity of the map. Detached and now floating in outer space between Cleo and Boreas, the colony of Hope is forever changed. The Terraformer has had to recalculate and adapt which has, in turn, mutated familiar biomes and created an exotic landscape. QUARANTINE ZONE Where Promenade East met West is now the Quarantine Zone. Promenade was wiped out by the Stasis Array Node that crashed down to the map. When what appeared to be Olympus collided with the Stasis Net satellite, Broken Moon s protection was no the crash debris and meteors to rain down along with biological material that has required the area to be quarantined. From a design perspective, the goal was to deliver a and more deliberate combat experience. We condensed the whole center of the map, making it more predictable where players can and can not rotate from. The layout of this POI makes for fast pace looting, combat, and some fun action with the covered ziprail loop, while providing a safe rotation from teams at the lower end. BREAKER WHARF Breaker Wharf was affected by the debris raining down, which gave us some room to. Because this POI was so secluded from the rest, we felt that there was an opportunity to move it and move it did! Now, look out for it where the Backup Atmostation was. This design change is that aims to break up the playstyle of this side of the map, where there were a lot of science buildings that played in a similar manner. Bringing over a more industrial kit will help break that repetitiveness, offering more gameplay variety to players. SPACE PORT Space Port is a smaller POI that breaks the mold of the original larger POIs and sits in the area that once was Breaker Wharf recreated by the mobilization to help keep Broken Moon alive and together. It serves a bigger purpose to bring more action to spaces, and is the perfect drop for to get some good loot. SEE YOU ON THE DROPSHIP With Broken Moon rising from the rubble, the long awaited return of Solos, a fresh pantheon of Artifacts, and a brand Legend, this season is just beginning.

She s the spark your squad needs to become Champions on the faster and deadlier Storm Point. This tempest of a map has been overhauled with a reduced size and fresh Points of Interest The Pylon, ZEUS Station, and Devastated Coast. Last but certainly not least, the is excited to share that Cross Progression will be rolling out starting this season. Link your platforms to an EA Account to show off your skills no matter where you squad up. LEGEND CONDUIT Conduit is a, bright, and. To rise quickly, Rowenna must don a combat rig made of an incomplete Monarch Titan that she knows is poisoning her. But it s a price she s willing to pay for her dream of being a Legend. At home, she s the core of her large family. She smoothes over issues with her humor and sunny disposition all while hustling and sacrificing that s unchanged in the. Despite the fact she s exchanging her life and health to be Conduit, Rowenna is having fun because she knows the. Expert, fan, s there and she has the replays saved and filed, and her teammates and know she s there to win! STORM POINT MAP Storm Point is a map that is loved by our competitive community for its more predictable pacing and high loot quality. However, some of the elements of Storm Point that make it a great competitive map can make it more difficult to quickly find action during casual. This brings us to the primary goal for this, which is to improve the fun factor without sacrificing competitive integrity. To do this, we ve taken the following actions Add attractive, central POIs for players searching for combat. Wattson s Pylon and CETO Station provide central hot drops for players looking to fight early. Reduce overall map size to improve pacing. Significant map size reductions to both the southern coastline and northern mountainous areas make these zones more attractive for early combat and reduce the overall distance between squads. Reduce friction of central rotations. With CETO Station replacing Prowler Island and a reworked Forbidden Zone, rotations through the center of map have never been smoother. IMC ARMORIES Unfortunately, the IMC Spectres failed to defend Storm Point from the storm, leaving only ravaged husks of the armories behind. Expect some high tier loot to remain but the Spectres will no longer defend the spoils. REWORKED AREA FORBIDDEN ZONE The Forbidden Zone was hit hard by lightning during the storm, destroying parts of the perimeter fence and causing the Prowlers to flee! Our goal for this area was to reduce the friction of rotating through the zone by removing the Prowlers, but providing structures to build better fronts and defensive options when squads are forced into combat. REWORKED AREA LIGHTNING ROD of the biggest opportunities we wanted to address with this was to solve for the low number of players choosing to drop on the high side of the map. In addition to adding ZEUS Station, the felt that it was important to reduce the overall size of this zone to help make these POIs feel better connected to another and the rest of Storm Point. And that s just about everything! The is looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the Storm Point and playing with you all. See you in the ring! CROSS PROGRESSION With the launch of Season, we re excited to roll out Cross Progression in a phased deployment across existing platforms in.

In an effort to address as many questions as possible, we re hosting a live Ranked AMA on July, from am Pacific Time. Join us on the subreddit! The art of development is rarely a straight line, it often involves building upon and refining is no exception. We hit some aspects of our goals, and missed the mark with some of our tuning and bugs, which caused the inflated number of players in Masters and occasional unfairness in matchmaking. Let take a deeper look at these issues and discuss some upcoming that will help us move towards a more stable and competitive Ranked for future seasons. For those who just want the gist, here s the TLDR Overly Generous Ladder Points LP Arsenal s LP tuning was intended to be generous, but not this generous. Its current tuning is causing a series of cascading issues with the rest of the Ranked system. We are tightening the amount of LP awarded and bonuses included for Season. Bugs We love to hate them. They are contributing to the tuning problem and we re feeling confident about our upcoming fixes. Future Season will focus on refining Ranked tuning and stability. We re going to take a deep breath and take the time needed to prepare for an even tighter and more competitive Ranked system. Thank you for your passion, your feedback, and for taking this journey with us. WHAT S HAPPENED IN ARSENAL LADDER POINTS PLACEMENT AND BONUS TUNING We intended Arsenal to be a learning experience for players adapting to the ruleset and matchmaking. Unfortunately, the combo of this and some bugs in the Ranked system caused Ladder Point gains to be extremely generous, resulting in an excess of Masters players. Season focus lowering the amount of LP distributed in a match to even out the distribution of players per rank. BONUSES When a s ranking vastly exceeds their Matchmaking Rating MMR equivalent, the bonus system withholds the bonus. This limit is intended and used to dial in the correct rank over time. Thanks to the aforementioned generous LP, some players rankings were inflated compared to their MMR causing them to hit this no bonus state much sooner. In extreme cases, the rank was tiers higher than the MMR which caused the bonus withholding system to completely overshadow all bonuses. With future adjustments, this state will return to being hard to reach. For the average not seeing bonuses, they d need to raise their MMR by actively defeating multiple squads per match while placing high in order to start getting bonuses again. But we know that it feels bad to perform well and not see any bonuses. Season focus adding a minimum elimination bonus increase based on the MMR that will be exempt from bonus withholding and bumping up the elim bonus slightly. RANK DISTRIBUTION Let s get right to it you may have even seen a graph the below. This inflation of Masters players is caused by a mix of bugs and the overly generous LP tuning. LP distribution skewed further to the right than we would, resulting in too many Masters players. The distribution is indicated in the below graph with the dotted line for players from Rookie through to LP. Our next steps LP gains per match will be decreased to address the shift in the ranking distribution. Adding a ruleset that only applies to Diamond to address the large concentration of players creeping above. Players in these ranked tiers will have increased stakes and LP losses, and decreased rating bonuses and loss mitigations. These solutions together will slow the pace to Masters for the average, and allow for more accurate matchmaking and higher quality at ranks. PLAYING THE END With the Arsenal updates, we re seeing more climactic end with multiple squads, players valuing their lives, and wanting to win the instead of deathmatch simulators. An intense firefight for the top placement in an exciting, hectic endgame is the most memorable way to close a of, and we re happy this is happening more frequently. The chart below is just of the metrics that we use to detect potential intensity of at various points during a match. Even additional players alive at the mark is impactful for the average match! PERCEPTIVE Perceptive is more macro focused, where is centered around ring positioning rather than all out extreme variant of this is often referred to as ratting. While exciting endgames are happening, there is room for improvement with the recent increase of ratting. A portion of this is due to an increased number of players waiting for ring closures, but we can safely say that it is mostly due to players hiding and avoiding others while crouching or standing. Pretty sure you re not all doing squat reps between We ve noticed a particular pattern in both Ranked and ALGS levels teams stay outside of the ring and delay interacting with other teams to gain points. Hiding and avoiding firefights isn t a rewarding way to. Season has some updates to target this, and more are coming in future seasons to address the core gameplay issues around inactivity and avoidant playstyles. Season focuses Adjusting ring timings to increase encounters Ring damage tuning to enforce playing inside the ring Fixed a number of ratting spots with more fixes to come MATCHMAKING GENEROUS LP S EFFECT ON MATCHMAKING We need to talk about a specific detail with the Arsenal matchmaker that wasn t in our previous ranked blog. While we generally matchmake based on MMR, we start using Ranking LP in place of a s MMR when their ranking exceeds their MMR equivalent. In an extreme example, if a Gold MMR has a LP ranking of Diamond, this will be matched into a Diamond lobby. This is to ensure MMR and LP ranking are connected and can both help guide players to their accurate Rank. If players succeed in these more difficult matchmaking situations, we allow them to continue climbing. Unfortunately, too many players in a have inflated LP because of the generous tuning. This effectively creates a full of players with lower MMR than their current Rank, nullifying the effect of this mechanic. In Arsenal, you ve been matching with a wider range of skill of players, even at the highest Ranks. This wasn t intended and meant that your experience varied much more than desired. We believe this will be less of an issue with reduced LP distribution in Season. Season focus updating matchmaking to better handle players that are actively challenging their MMR to ensure a competitively challenging match that mirrors their current ranking. MATCH QUALITY The matchmaking algorithm is producing more competitive matches overall and matchmaking gameplay metrics are up across the board. As an example, let s look at gameplay metric Total Damage per Match. We use this to have an understanding of match intensity. When a match is unfair, many squads are decimated by an outlier squad, thus denying many players opportunities to deal damage. In contrast, a more fair match will have squads fighting, taking cover, and recovering, resulting in more overall damage dealt in a. QUEUE TIME We believe queue times are too short, contributing to a higher chance you re matched outside of your MMR. The graph below shows average wait time by skill lower skill on the left of the, higher on the right. During matchmaking, the system is trying to find players of a similar longer it searches, the closer the match. The intent is to find similarly skilled players for maximum excitement and challenge, but it s a race against the clock. Waiting forever isn t fun there aren t enough exact matches to your MMR, the matchmaking system will continue to search for a limited time before starting the match with the closest MMR players it can find. Matchmaking is failing at the extreme end of very high skill. These players are getting into matches too quickly, creating unfair matches with a too wide MMR eliminating the lobby. We re working on improving matchmaking for that end of the ladder to combat this. Season focus the elusive root cause of this bug has been identified and we re actively working on a fix for more consistent, match experiences. The rest of the population is very stable and are more consistently matching with close MMR values. The graph below shows the adjusted MMR width of a, highlighting how close MMR is in matches based on your current MMR LP. Overall, the value is consistent across all but the highest tier of. This is great because it means the matchmaker is working consistently and delivering consistently competitive matches for most players. Even though it s consistent, the width above tiers is still bigger than we d and we are confident we can tighten matches to divisions instead of tiers within a reasonable queue time. Season focus continued improvements and updates to matchmaking as a whole. These will ship as they are ready and are not locked to cycles. SEASON AND BEYOND The has been hard at work digging into Arsenal s data, working to address known bugs, and refining the Ranked system further. If you ve made it this far, thanks for your time. Here s a quick recap Decreasing overall LP gains per match to combat the overall shift in the rank distribution. Adding a ruleset that only applies to to properly dial in the top of the ladder. Players in these ranked tiers will have increased stakes and losses, and decreased rating bonuses and loss mitigations. Be ready to put it all on the line. Adding a minimum elimination bonus increase based on the MMR and buffing elimination bonus in general. Eliminations should always be a contributor to your rank. Increasing action in the ring by adjusting ring damage. Adjusting ring timings to create more encounters and less lulls. Updating matchmaking to better handle players that are actively challenging their MMR, for more competitively challenging matches that mirror their ranking. Waiting until Season for these updates gives us more data to further inform these and strengthen our tuning, but it gives players who made it to their first Masters time to relish the moment. If you earned Masters in Arsenal, you ll keep it. You played by the rules we implemented, and hopefully Season will challenge you to earn it again. We want to deliver the best Ranked BR experience in the world, with the tightest matchmaking and the sweatiest competition at every rank tier. Splits will not be returning for now as we re focusing on monitoring and further finetuning. We look forward to sharing more updates on Ranked and how we plan to achieve our goals, especially as we approach Season is already in motion!

We got some rejuvenations for World Edge that are sure to improve drops of all spice levels. But wait, there more including the debut of Weapon Mastery, robust updates to the Firing Range, the debut of the Evac Tower, and more! WORLD EDGE MAP With this we aim to improve the overall experience and bring a healthy set of to World s Edge in Arsenal. Starting off with our Point of Interest, Monument. POI MONUMENT of the hottest topics for World s Edge is Fragment East and West. This season we have decided to make some starting with our POI, Monument. We know Fragment is a polarizing spot on the map, and we it to boot. Our goal was to be delicate and add something fresh to the map center. Fictionally, Monument stands as a testament to the. Its museum celebrates s past, present, and future. It s a shining beacon to us on the dev. A glowing reminder for how far has come since its initial debut in. The Monument Project has been brought to you by Silva the way to a brighter future at the Edge of the World. From a design standpoint, Monument is a deep bunker with a quick access sniper nest for positional control and scouting. The glass ceiling brings an interesting component to the vertically layered fights this space offers. It s a different pace to the familiar collapsed map center and we hope you enjoy it. That being said, we did make more big change to. POI STACKS In our efforts to balance the map s landing distributions, the tower of the sweat lords had to. You know the, built a stack of pancakes with ziplines on either end Fragment s infamous Construction Stack. Don t worry, it s not gone we just moved it. Now introducing Stacks! Our Point of Interest on the southern edge. Built a red velvet layer cake, Stacks is a crow s nest that s all about verticality with its interconnected rooftops replacing the Lava City. Positioned right next to Rampart s Big Maude, we plan for the here to be high. Did someone say cat and mouse? LAVA UPDRAFT IS NO MORE In this Season, we have completely the vertical updraft movement system from World s Edge. This floaty state above deep Lava Fissures was a remnant of World s Edge that is no longer needed with our recent map adjustments. To compensate, we have raised the lava floor and it is now walkable. Be careful, it s hot. HARVESTER After removing the lava updraft, it was logical to improve the landing experience at Harvester. Threading the needle through the building s central tube will now bring players to a safe landing platform. Safe but surrounded by lava. This loot honey pot provides a shortcut. You can now catch a zipline across Harvester s circular arena from below, adding a approach to fights here. We ve created a vertical connection. An open window that allows players to jump from Harvester s center room to the platform below. It s a risky escape route for when your squad is being pinched by predators. VAULT NEAR SKYHOOK We ve an additional Vault for balanced Vault distribution. This North vault is nestled in a tunnel leading to Skyhook. Vault key drops have been increased Vault loot has been relaxed. Loba mains rejoice. SNOW IN SKYHOOK Hammond s Climatizer technology has made advances cooling the region down. Additional Climate Seeding Towers have been installed near Skyhook to further their efforts. As a result, Skyhook has received a fresh dusting of snow, opening pathways and injecting some life to the area. MIRAGE A TROIS This Party POI has left the previous Season s maps and has now settled in World s Edge. WEAPON MASTERY Weapon Mastery is our first progression system outside of account level! As we look to make more approachable for players, this system incentivizes them to learn about the strengths and character of all our weapons.

Expect to find this survival item on the floor, inside loot bins, and in care packages. Deploying an Evac Tower will send a rocket skyward, eventually exploding into a balloon high above the action. Once the anchor brings the zipline to ground level, will be able to ride up and initiate a skydive, redeploying to a location. Be careful though the Evac Tower has a limited duration and will slowly take damage over time. Enemies and allies can shoot the balloon to accelerate this process, destroying both the Evac Tower and your hopes of escaping.

Respawn has always stood a cut above the rest when it comes to representation, and Catalyst is a big step forward for the pool of playable trans characters in mainstream. The a from the Outlands trailer, which gives us our first glimpse of Catalyst, begins with the character sharing her past with fellow legend Rampart, focusing on the planet Boreas and its moon, Cleo. After meeting a younger Catalyst and her lunar coven, we get to hear her talk plainly about her transition during a tender moment with her friend Margo, making her status as a trans woman definitive for all to see. The trailer ends with an plot against Hammond Robotics, likely leading her to the soon after. Honestly, this hits every beat for me on exceptional representation her goth witch aesthetic, a abilities, and amazing voice direction by an actual trans voice actor, no less make Catalyst a fantastic addition to a roster already brimming with colourful, standout characters.

But a trace of the human doctor remains, and she poses a greater threat to Ash than any Legend in the ring. Passive Marked for Death Ash map shows the location of recent deathboxes.

MAP STORM POINT This beautiful oasis was once an energy colony for the IMC, and the ruins remain. Many have tried to make a home here all have failed. A survey of the area revealed the remains of three unique settlements built across the centuries, but no survivors. The colony lay abandoned, only visited by the occasional pirate or castaway. Now the Mercenary Syndicate has plans of their own for Storm Point. It looks so enticing, but the pristine beaches and crystal waters are just the eye of the hurricane. All around, dangers swirl wild prowlers, venomous spiders, and the gathering storms only add to the tension in the air. Now the are here to make this place their own. So it looks Storm Point is only going to get more dangerous. Check out our blog with all the details here. MAP ROTATION For the Escape the map rotation will be back down to maps Storm Point and World s Edge. With Storm Point being a whole map, we want to make sure players have plenty of time to master the arena. ARENAS MAP ROTATION With the introduction of Encore, the Arenas map rotation will now include only the custom made Arenas maps. We will not be using BR locations for Arenas in the Escape. WEAPON. SMG When you re in a precarious place, you need a dangerous, flexible weapon meet the. SMG. The Combat Advanced Round submachine gun is a fully automatic weapon that takes adaptability to the next level by accepting either Light or Heavy mags. The. hits hard but handles light, this hybrid weapon s the best of both worlds for when you re ready to take a stand and become the most dangerous thing on the island. RANKED UPDATES Hello,! Let s take a quick look at how Ranked in Emergence shaped up and review the coming in Escape. Ranked continues to attract a large portion of players around of all playtime!, but this doesn t mean we can t look to make improvements. Note We fixed an issue where expired skydrive trails remained accessible for longer than they should have. These trails will now expire on the intended seasonal cadence, as mentioned originally in the Ranked Series post trails from Series are still grandfathered in. RANKED ESCAPE Skill in can be evaluated in all sorts of ways. It s the amalgamation of gun skill, movement, positioning, awareness, legend mastery, and prevailing over everyone else as Champion that separates the lowly Bronze from Predators. With that in mind, we want to provide more flexibility and nuance to how players can express skill when RP gains are at stake. Before Escape, measurements have been simple and straightforward. We grant RP based on kill points and a placement multiplier. Now, we re easing back on some RP restrictions to offer other routes to max out RP in a match. TL DR Just give me the summary Kill RP values now take differences between Ranked tiers into account. The kill RP cap as we have traditionally thought about it up to this point is effectively being raised from to seven. However, this RP cap can be reached in different ways, depending on tier differences and placement. Placement is still paramount, and you still must place first to have a chance at max total RP. To expand on the first point, tier differences between the killer and victim will be taken into account when calculating baseline kill point value. For example, if a Plat kills a Diamond, that kill counts as instead of RP. The maximum kill point RP is. Any RP that exceeds that after placement and tier modifiers are doesn t affect total RP. The final step is to add a flat placement bonus. Enough with the math, let s explain these with an example As a Platinum, you party up with your Diamond friend and matchmake into a lobby with similarly skilled players. You snag second place, with kills assists against Diamond players, and on Plat players. Each kill on those Diamond players is worth points instead of the typical, because they are rank tier higher than you. That leaves us with RP. Now let s take placement into account. In second, the per kill bonus is, so our kills including assists RP. We re curious to see how these affect the ranked grind. Jump into Storm Point this first split and let us know how they feel. Stay tuned this is only the start of what we have in for Ranked improvements. RANKED ARENAS ESCAPE We learned a lot from the first season of Ranked arenas and are eager to bring you some improvements Arenas Ranked now has splits, similar to Ranked Along with each season and split, there is a soft MMR reset and placement matches. seasons require the usual placement matches while a split only requires placement matches. Improvements have been made to matchmaking for finding similarly skilled teammates. Reduced the AP amount gained or lost from MMR differences between teams. DEV NOTE The final calculated AP amount for a match is a factor of your current AP and MMR. It s influenced by the MMR differences between teams. In practice, this difference was factoring in more than we wanted.. Losing a match you were slightly favored to win was giving a bigger AP loss than desired. NOTES BALANCE WATTSON Move aside Ash, this is Wattson s season. We re ecstatic to finally share some Wattson improvements! Her win rate and encounter win rate have always been above average. This could be for a multitude of reasons her defensive playstyle correlates to higher average placements, Wattson mains are diehard loyalists, and her hitbox has been the smallest in the ever since Lifeline s adjustment. Regardless, much of the data that we ve shared doesn t match perception. a few as Wattson and you ll often find yourself wanting more out of her kit. The goal of these is to redistribute her invisible power into the parts of her kit that shape the battlefield in a unique way. We wanted to see what could spark more consistency and efficacy in her kit, and ideally ground some of the difficulties surrounding the way her abilities work. We want to enable more active gameplay from Wattson players by smoothing out the rough edges in placing fences. Responsiveness tweaks, longer range, and faster cooldowns means that Wattson can much more quickly and reliably set up a defensive position, or even use her fences and pylon in the midst of open combat in a pinch. General Improved the reliability and responsiveness of placing Wattson Tactical and Ultimate objects. Wattson can place her Tactical and Ultimate objects on valid surfaces above Wattson eye level to a reasonable extent. General hitbox size increase, to compensate for the removal of low profile in the Legacy. Tactical Perimeter Defense Increased damage on crossing a Fence by. to Increased debuff duration on crossing a Fence by. to seconds Increased the time allowance to be hit again by a subsequent Fence effect by. to second. Decreased recharge time by to seconds. Increased placement range by. Decreased the delay between Fences shutting off and reactivating after an ally passes through them by. seconds Wattson now moves at while Fence nodes. Fence nodes can now be placed as soon as the weapon is readied, instead of waiting for the animation to finish. Ultimate Interception Pylon The Pylon output has been significantly reworked Reduced the number of active Pylons Wattson can place from to. The Pylon now lasts forever instead of timing out after seconds. The Pylon now has a pool of Shields that can be distributed to nearby players, instead of effectively infinite Shields. Increased the Pylon shield recharge rate by, and smoothed regen rate., or more accurately seconds seconds When a Pylon is out of Shields, it no longer recharges players Shields, but can still zap incoming ordnance. Taking damage while regenerating Shields via the Pylon delays continued regeneration by second. The UI on the ground and HUD elements now displays the amount of Shields that remain in the Pylon. Pinging a friendly Pylon will now display the percentage of Shields remaining in the Pylon. Pylon has been moderately reworked. Ordnance is now zapped when the Pylon detects that it would hit any surface within range and line of sight of the Pylon, instead of being zapped as soon as it comes within range. As a part of the, current issues where the Pylon does reliably zap ordnance particularly concerning airstrike abilities, and ordnance that bounced off surfaces near the Pylon should now be addressed. BALANCE WEAPONS GEAR SUPPLY DROP ROTATION This season the returns to floor loot and taking its place is the Scout. The Scout enters the Supply Drop with its old friend the Trigger equipped. Triple Take now an marksman Charge time from value Mag increase at all tiers Base, White, Blue, Purple Ammo consumed per shot increased to Ammo required per shot increased to HOP UPS Dual Shell Each round loaded into the Mastiff or the Repeater is doubled. FULLY KITTED ROTATION Mastiff Repeater,, CAR, Longbow Peacekeeper, Rampage,, Flatline, and Charge Rifle Fire rate reduced from to DEV NOTE With the reduced bolt scaling we ve done in previous passes the is still performing ahead of the shotgun pack. Hitting the base fire rate should help balance out our shotgun roster. PEACEKEEPER Slightly increased pellet size Choke up time reduced from to Choked up shots remain tight for slightly longer when exiting ADS DEV NOTE When the PK came out of the crate we gave it a big sweep of nerfs to make sure the floor PK wasn t the crate monster we had all grown to know. In this pass, we swung a little hard so we re giving it a QOL and usability pass this season. LONGBOW Damage reduced from to DEV NOTE We re walking back a recent buff to the Longbow that proved unnecessary. We wanted to give it some love due to all the recent Marksman updates but it seems the Longbow was just fine. Reduced barrel effectiveness at all rarity tiers Significantly reduced projectile collision size Damage reduced from to DEV NOTE The has been a to be reckoned with this season so we re taking a big swing and hitting its projectile size and damage in an effort to bring it down a notch. SCOUT Damage increased from to Double Tap to Supply Drop Scout DEV NOTE With the Scout entering the supply drop we re giving it a bump to damage and adding back on the retired Double Tap to give it some extra spice. SUPPLY DROP WEAPON RATES Early crate weapon rate increased from to Mid crate weapon rate increased from to Late crate weapon rate increased from to DEV NOTE Pushing a supply drop in the end and whiffing on a weapon feels pretty rough. We want to improve the reliability of getting crate weapons out of supply drops throughout all phases of the. Don t worry, we re adjusting Kraber spawn rates accordingly to keep them in line. HOT ZONE GOLD LOOT RATES Increased amount of gold loot that spawns in hot zones DEV NOTE Hot Zones can sometimes feel a bit lackluster so we re injecting more loot into these dynamic zones to make them more enticing drop spots. CRAFTING Increased ammo from crafting Light Ammo Heavy Ammo Energy Ammo Shotgun Ammo Arrows Sniper Crafting Ammo price increased from to per weapon Evo Armor Points from crafting increased from to Evo Armor Points cost increased from to Replaced a sniper bundle with a shotgun bundle featuring the Dual Shell ENEMY NPC UPDATES Prowler health across the has gone up from to Storm Point and World s Edge Prowlers on World s Edge and Flyers on Kings Canyon now reward EVO points all damage done to AI now rewards progress to your EVO armor ARENAS Supply Drop Supply drop will now land outside the first ring, if possible, and land seconds earlier.

For a start, Storm Point has been designed by Rodney Reece, who created the competitive scene current map of choice, World Edge. While Storm Point is pushing boundaries in terms of its size and introduces a loot mechanic in the form of wildlife, all of its innovations appear to have been made with considerations of the competitive scene in mind. Speaking to The Loadout, Reece lifts the lid on how some members of the competitive community helped shape the most striking aspect of Storm Point its verticality. From a competitive perspective, we knew this could be problematic, Reece admits. There were a lot of things to solve. So immediately, we did internal tests, where we bring competitive players in.

As well as allowing players to dive straight into map Storm Point in the first split of the season, players will have a revised ranked scoring system to get their heads around too. While the base principle remains the same kills, placement bonuses, and placement scores all combine to give you an end RP score the maths is changing somewhat for ranked Season. While placement points will all stay the same, Respawn is relaxing the rules on RP earned through kills and assists. Say goodbye to the cut off for RP, and say hello to a more dynamic scoring system. So how does it work? Well, for a start, the amount of RP you earn for each kill or assist will now scale depending on the rank of the opponent. If you a and kill a Diamond, you will receive RP, rather than the standard RP. This scales down too, so if you a Gold killing a Silver, you will earn only RP. a the rest of the story RELATED LINKS a crossplay how to with friends across platforms a ranked ranks, splits, and Season scoring explained a tier list the best to use in Season",

This POI is big enough to accommodate a few teams fighting over the shop itself, and she s built a wonderful paintball course out front that acts as a spill off location if the drop just looks too spicy. Inside the shop, you can use collected materials to purchase Rampart s Custom Modded Paintball Weapons from the Machines. These guns cost a bit, but they come fully kitted at different tiers.

Dev Note and Mobility Tech Written by John JayBiebs Larson The planned to have been delayed to a later. via respawn Twitter The playapex has recently discovered some unexpected side effects of our planned to. It is still our intention to address some of the most egregious of, but for now we are delaying our planned change to a later. Movement is sacred in. We weigh every change to these systems carefully and value feedback. After further testing, we concluded we need to take more time to get this right to make sure related movement mechanics are caught in the. Earlier this week, we announced our intention to remove, a decision that was met with surprise by many movement enthusiasts. is a term associated with different sorts of movement, depending on who you ask. Internally, we generally use it to describe what many associate with strafing. To be more explicit, this change targets multiple rapid directional commands after jumping. Movement should feel unchanged for controllers and for M K players who hadn t heard of the term until this week. Thanks to the work of a couple of our engineers, this is now easily tunable on the fly, and we have the ability to iterate on or even revert it completely without a client. Our goal is to remove some of the sharpness in momentum conservation around angles. That s what I m thinking of when I use the term throughout this post. Things redirects back onto that same wall should feel unchanged, but movement afforded by strafing will be. Since is a unique M K mechanic, many platforms have asked about our approach to systems aim assist. As and its players evolve, it s only prudent for us to continue to evaluate whether or not aim assist needs adjustment. When controller players say they would be alright with nerfing aim assist, we definitely take note. Players should not feel forced to use a specific input type to stay competitive When people say, Gee dang it, Respawn s balancing decisions cater to controller players, the best answer I have is When it comes to accessibility, we often must consider controller players given the constraints compared to M K. But, accessibility isn t the same as balance design, and it s a strawman argument to treat it as This is why we believe exists solely as a design problem. Even in a M world, or a scenario where controller and M K could just the same, we don t believe it would be a healthy change with the freedom it currently allows, for three main reasons The first issue it s highly inaccessible. By inaccessible, we mean that it s an opaque technique that s practically impossible to learn organically and the most egregious examples require a strange keybind. Secondly, have terrible readability and limited. Path grapples and Octane pads aside, I ve seen clips of players breaking ankles with victims including players who are at a loss for what to do. While it s not terribly prevalent, I m concerned about how this could continue to evolve as more players adapt and further develop their mechanics. The third point, and the most problematic, is how is exacerbated by movement abilities. I can buy that a at normal velocity in a gunfight occurs infrequently and is relatively mild enough to not immediately kill with fire. But Path grappling past and back into your face with a Mastiff, or Octane cranking while maintaining ridiculous speed both bring up greater gameplay concerns. Mobility creep is something to be very mindful of in this. While many love the freedom that s movement system affords, constraints are just as important. It s not surprising that mobility are highly popular. Why don t we just do more of that? Well, over time and I d say we are already seeing it mobility creep can open up a Pandora box of problems to solve. How is third partying affected by mobility? Within a fight, how are frontlines defined? How quickly can I close the gap on an enemy? As a, is designed to work well with a finite number of movement possibilities. I feel it s important to note that limitations don t always equate to lowering there are in working within constraints. could argue that healing lowered the could make up for misplays with less constraints on their ability to safely heal. Different types of skill expression are changed when we touch something perfect air control, for better or for worse. Hopefully this provided some context, and as always, we re happy to hear your thoughts.",

RANKED ARENAS With the launch of the Emergence, we re introducing Ranked Arenas! You begin your journey through Ranked Arenas in placement matches where your performance will determine your initial Match Marking Rank MMR and your starting rank. MMR variance is wider initially, so your first matches might be until your MMR defines your placement. Arenas is a fight between teams of three, so awarding Ranked Arenas Points is more than in the. This means there is no entry cost and no AP for kills. Everything comes down to getting the win. That s just the high level of how ranked arenas work.

LEGEND META FUSE Enemies caught inside the ring of fire from Fuse Motherlode ultimate are now revealed to Fuse. Knuckle Cluster Tactical explosion duration increased by. Grenadier Passive can be toggled on and off to throw ordnance normally. Dev Note Fuse continues to struggle. We identified opportunities to help him that were just give him more We believe is a gun first and foremost and therefore want to make sure we do put too much damage into character abilities. The first opportunity we identified was his tactical. While meant as a persistent area denial tool, it currently does not last long enough to seriously inconvenience an enemy. We doubled the duration so you can now place at a door and be reasonably sure no coming through that door for a little while. While we doubled the duration, the damage per second remains the same. Please don t stand in the fire. Secondly, his ultimate often did give his an advantage sure, you may catch enemies within it, but the flames made it impossible for you to step inside, and you could see the enemies you trapped either because the flames were in the way. We explored a few ways to deal with this but ended up going for the most answer you get enemy outlines as long as they stay inside the ring of fire. HORIZON Reduced the slow after the initial Black Hole pull. Bumped Horizon gravity speed to a happy medium between and Legacy launch values. Dev note There s no doubt the nerfs Horizon received with Legacy were necessary, but given the benefit of time and hindsight we decided we probably hit the speed of her tactical too hard. Instead of completely reverting that part of the nerf, we found a happy medium between how fast her gravity lift operated at release and how slow it was after the nerf. This hard to communicate with numbers, so just give her a try and tell us what you think. REVENANT There s now a visual and audio cue when Death Totem protection is about to end which can be by other players. a brief slow after being recalled to Death Totem. CAUSTIC Gas damage starts at, increases by every other tick indefinitely. Cooldown on Tactical has been reduced. Ultimate cooldown has been reduced. Duration reduced from. Dev note Caustic is a dangerous character to buff. Push him a little too far, and he quickly takes over the meta. Constantly fighting through gas is no fun, so we definitely want to avoid him becoming dominant once more. That said, we now convinced the nerf that dropped his gas damage to a flat damage went too far. When you can sit in gas and take a syringe or and be fine, gas is not a scary enough deterrent. So we switched back to a scaling model. This time we decided to let the damage scale a little more slowly. Instead of going up by every tick, we increasing it by every other tick. Damage is uncapped at the top here, but that very theoretical. Enemies will generally be dead around the time the gas reaches damage per tick unless you been healing. The desired effect here is to make enemies feel a great urgency to leave the gas as soon as possible. At the same time, we wanted to be mindful specifically of Caustic impact in late circles at the highest level. Even with Ring now slowly closing over seconds, we were worried about the effect that a single Caustic ult could have in the late. We reduced its duration by seconds. The ult represents Caustic highest moment of power his enemies have no way of countering it. seconds is still a meaningful amount of time and with the damage, is long enough to kill someone but it should hopefully make fighting a Caustic in the end slightly less frustrating. WEAPON META SUPPLY DROP ROTATION This season the Prowler returns to floor loot and taking its place is the Spitfire. In addition to the Spitfire this season another weapon will be joining the supply drop the Alternator SMG. See how each weapon down below. HOP UPS Boosted Loader Reloading near empty but not at increases reload speed and overloads the next magazine with extra rounds. This hop up will be equipable to the Hemlok Burst AR and the Wingman. To make room, the Anvil Receiver and Quickdraw Holster are being vaulted for now. FULLY KITTED ROTATION Peacekeeper, Rampage,, Flatline, and Charge Rifle Wingman, Bocek,, Hemlock, and Sentinel MAGAZINE ATTACHMENTS Reload speed increase associated with magazines has been moved to the equivalent stock rarity tier. Dev Note Magazines are the most potent source of lootable power for most weapons and that largely comes in the form of ammo capacity. In addition to capacity, they were offering increased reload speed. We ve moved the reload speed buff to stocks to help increase the value of stocks and spread out our meaningful modifiers across our attachments. STOCK ATTACHMENTS All stocks now offer increased reload speed instead of magazines Marksman Weapons Repeater, Scout, now take Sniper Stocks instead of Tactical Stocks Sniper Stocks on Marksman weapons will offer increased stability and sway reduction with slightly reduced handling bonuses from tactical stocks Dev Note Sniper stocks are an often lonely attachment left sitting on the floor waiting for a crackshot legend to come along and give them some love.

Now takes Energy on the work differently than other weapons because of its unique interaction with ammo.

LIGHT MACHINE GUNS Reduced the headshot multiplier for all LMGs from to Increased the limbshot multiplier for all LMGs from to Dev Note LMG was feeling a little too oppressive when random headshots chunked with a damage modifier. We re shaving off some of that headshot firepower but adding a little back in by bringing up their limb damage. Unloading massive LMG mags to suppress your enemies should still be a valid tactic, we re just reigning in the peaks and valleys to make it feel a bit more consistent. PISTOLS Reduced handling time for all pistols by Raise, Holster, Zoom time Dev Note With the removal of the Quickdraw Holster and reload speed moving from mags to stocks Pistols took a bit of a hit. We re increasing their base handling but will keep an eye on their performance as we get into Emergence. PROWLER BURST PDW Time Between Burst increased from to Dev Note The Prowler returns to the floor without its trusty the Select Fire hop up. But don t sleep on it, it still a beast. SPITFIRE Damage increased from to Hip Fire Spread back to season values Purple Mag Size increased from to Dev Note We ve all woken up with a cold sweat in the middle of the night from a nightmare where Rampart with gold mag spittys chases you on the World s Edge train tracks laughing maniacally as she shoots for eternity, right? right? Well for those of us that have, we ll be able to sleep soundly for a while. The Spitfire takes its rightful place as a Supply Drop weapon this season. We ve hit it a few times in recent patches and we still want it to be a desirable Supply Drop weapon so we re walking back those nerfs while making it much harder to access. ALTERNATOR Reintroducing the Disruptor Rounds which come equipped on a Supply Drop Alternator Disruptor Rounds Increase shield damage by Disruptor Rounds can ONLY be found on Alternators from the Supply Drop Dev Note The Alternator joins the Spitfire in the Supply Drop with its old friend the Disruptor Rounds. The shield damage has come down since we last saw Disruptors in Season, but it s still a shield shredding monster. Pack an extra bat. REPEATER Reload speed from stocks is increased. Dev Note The can slap, but when it not slapping it s probably reloading. We re buffing the s bonus to reload speed from stocks to help alleviate of the sharper pain points when running this heavy rifle. Significantly reduced bolt scaling for each rarity tier Base remains unchanged Dev Note The s speed makes it a forgiving and formidable shotgun to run. It s pulled ahead of the pack and has been seen as the clear choice for many leaving the Peacekeeper, Mastiff, and Mozambique in the dust. This change should help even the playing field between the shotguns. ARENAS WEAPON UPDATES Care package apply to arenas the Prowler and Rampage replace the Alternator and Spitfire in the Arenas shop.

Fixed a bug that prevented the Drone from being able to detect enemies using Trident. Revenant Fixed a visual bug when the Heirloom appears to be floating in when looking up and down inside the Gravity Lift. Placing a Death Totem too close to the edge of the map should no longer teleport players off the map when returning to the totem. Emote fix the missing Silence Orb to Revenant Suffering Silence emote. Fixed some exploitable hiding spots reachable in Rift using Revenant. Fixed some cases when Revenant didn t have horizontal movement animations when holding the heirloom. Loba Lots of fixes across all maps to address issues with exploits, hiding spots, and inconsistencies with using Loba s tactical.

The Thrillseekers Event kicks off July, and runs until August,. on for details. ARENAS MAP OVERFLOW The floor is lava! Well, some of it, anyway. Overflow differs from other Arena maps by being lane focused where each location is separated by tall, structures. With this separation, players can not easily spot early decisions made by the other and will need to stay vigilant before committing to a side or risk being flanked. While there are opportunities for engagements, combat tends to favor ranges along either POI Overlook or Slope. Overlook is a long, open area with a central interior that gives a height advantage over this POI. While this area is perfect for snipers or DMRs, players may want to hold the interior to control not only this area but their flank as well. Slope, as the name implies, offers both a high ground and a unique area where players can slide down to a remote part of the map. This area can be used for sneaky flanks or defensive setups where players may not expect it. Overflow feels pretty different from our other maps, and our hope is that it will feel rewarding for both defensive and aggressive players alike. Let us know what you think!

If you tuned into an APAC North broadcast since December, they have been shown live on Dazs channel as he shoutcasts the action. It pretty much a solo effort. He researches the teams, he finds the action, he follows the storylines you name it, and Dazs does it. While he collaborates and works with a Lynch, EA head of broadcast, and the larger broadcast, he is largely left to his own devices. Why? Well it largely because his streams are broadcast in the dead of night, while the rest of America sleeps. What makes a man get up in the small hours of the morning every other weekend to shoutcast a tournament for a region that he does represent, for no pay? After all, SoaR competes in the NA region, where Dazs lives and works, and in a tournament scene it will rarely compete against teams from APAC North or any other region.

Click the video down below to watch. for Legacy Arenas The are going underground with the introduction of a permanent mode Arenas. Fully reassembled and unimpressed with the glitz and glamor of the, former Predator Ash is taking the competition back to its roots. A purer form of combat. The rules are simple. Eliminate your enemies to win the round. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You win, or you die. Arenas features a set of custom maps, for combat with more to come in the future. Squads start each round in a spawn room, where they can get weapons, gear, and abilities, and adjust their loadout as their strategy. The first to win three rounds with at least a lead will be crowned the they to a tie. Then they ll have the honor of participating in Ash s favorite part of the Sudden Death. For more on Arenas, check out the blog for a full deep dive into the mode. Party Crasher Short version, Mirage took the voyage on a joyride and it didn t as planned. Party Crasher is of exciting custom arenas where you ll be able to show off your skills. This arena takes place in a ritzy, downtown plaza where players can choose to engage on the crashed Mirage Voyage, or the opulent story buildings that make up the downtown. Stay vigilante, as this map hosts a variety of engagement close quarters and long distance. Phase Runner The Phase Runner on Olympus is unique, but it wasn t the first of its kind. Phase Runner is the second of our custom arenas, and our largest. You ll fight in a hidden, experimental zone at the peak of a mountain where a prototype phase runner lays for use. This map gives you a lot of space to maneuver, so be sure to be on the lookout for those who prefer to be patient and take you out from afar. Sound tactics and clear communication are what you ll need to come out on top as you fight through the construction site or near the phase runner exit. In addition to the maps, other areas from our three BR maps will be thrown into a rotation, giving you five maps total for Arenas. At the start you ll get Artillery from Kings Canyon, Thermal Station from World s Edge, and Golden Gardens from Olympus. Valkyrie Kairi Imahara, the daughter of Predator Viper, salvaged the remains of her father Northstar Titan years after his death. With Rampart help, she fashioned it into a sleek jetpack that honors her family s legacy. Now, she s entered the under the name VALKYRIE. Passive VTOL Jets Use your jetpack to reposition or reach high places. You have limited fuel and can not use weapons while flying. Tactical Missile Swarm Fire a swarm of which damage and disorient the enemy. Ultimate Skyward dive Take to the skies to reposition a long distance across the map. Your squadmates can join in. Class Recon Scanning Survey Beacons reveals the next circle s location. Bocek The Bocek pronounced compound bow is a precision marksman weapon that rewards a skilled and confident hand. Holding down fire will draw the bow over a short time, increasing the power of the shot, with maximum power giving optimal damage and projectile speed. Repeatedly firing the Bocek right as it reaches max power provides the best sustained damage. The Bocek uses a ammo type, Arrows, which are unique to this weapon. Arrows are more rare on the battlefield, but fired arrows will stick into surfaces and remain in the world for players to pick back up and reuse. The hcog classic, holosight, hcog, variable, and hcog optics can all be equipped. The Bocek can be further modified with the entering the, Shatter Caps and Deadeye s Tempo it can even equip both simultaneously! Olympus The Lost Fleet A fleet of mysterious ships have made their way to Olympus and brought with them an otherworldly, parasitic plant that has begun to take root along the surface. The lead ship, The Icarus, has docked with the city and changed the landscape for good. Fight through the claustrophobic halls of the ghost ship, search corpses for a mysterious key card, and walk away as the last squad standing. our latest map blog to get a detailed look at what s changed on Olympus. To allow everyone to see the latest map, Olympus will be the only map in rotation for the first week of the season. Starter Kit and Loot Players will now start a match with a Starter Kit consisting of a Level EVO Shield, Helmet, and Knockdown Shield, plus Shield Cells and Syringes each. We ve Level Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the loot pool. Spawn chances for Level EVO Shields in the loot pool have been significantly reduced. Along with the lowered or spawn chances for these items, we ve rebalanced the loot pool such that versions of these items will appear nearly the same as they do now, but other item types will appear more often weapons, ordinance, health, ammo, etc. Dev note We wanted to take a crack at improving the loot for a while, with our design goals being to make picking up loot feel more impactful to the, and to thin out our loot a bit in general, since we always adding items to the pool. The recent Locked Loaded takeover mode helped us some of the we looking to make moving forward certain pieces of loot, and loot types specifically, are being put on notice. We removing Level Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the ground loot because these seemed the least exciting, least meaningful equipment pickups we had. Their power is practically invisible, so they do feel a character improvement in the way that things, say, a Backpack feels getting those extra slots feels SO chunky!. We keeping Level EVO Shields in the loot pool albeit at a lower spawn chance in addition to adding them to your starter kit because having them sprinkled around is still important for shenanigans. Finally, granting these pieces of gear from the start of the is intended to improve the hot drop situation having more health, some headshot damage reduction, and a little knockdown protection can help give players some more time to react to a chaotic hot drop than before. Be on the lookout for more loot in the future! This will be an ongoing project. Emotes Introducing Emotes! Every Legend will have emote unlocked at launch and additional emotes can be obtained through packs or by crafting them. Equip your emotes to the emote wheel and flex away! It s great fun to show off to your squadmates in the starting room of Arenas, and of course you have to use them on the Winner s podium. Now, since emotes kick your camera back to a view, we know some folks are already thinking about corner peeking. Competitive integrity is still paramount, so enemies that your character couldn t see in view will not be shown while you are in third person. This video shows the feature working on the purple Dummie behind the rock. Without it, Pathfinder would be able to use the person camera to gain knowledge that he shouldn t have. All emotes have enabled and there is no way to disable it. Battlepass Unlock the premium Legacy Pass and level it up to unlock skins Rampart s Crafty Kitsune at Premium Level and Wraith s Demon s Whisper at Premium Level. Legend Updates Low Profile Characters Low profile no longer exists! This trait has been from Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson. Dev Note After our successful experiment with Wraith hitboxes, we are now confident that we can solve balance issues between smaller and larger through to their kits and hitboxes. It is finally time for Low Profile to the way of the dodo. Sorry dodos. Lifeline Combat Revive No longer deploys a shield. Can now revive players at the same time. Can now cancel active revives in progress to allow your teammate to defend themselves with their knockdown shield.. Heal Drone Heal rate increased from per second to per second. Deployment time before healing begins reduced by roughly. Care Package Cooldown reduced from minutes to minutes. Now guarantees an upgrade if possible in three categories Body Shield, Other Equipment Helmet, Backpack, and Knockdown Shield, and Weapon Attachment, based on your s current gear when the Package arrives. Dev Note Lifeline s kit was not in a particularly healthy place. The Passive shield was extremely to the point of frustration, while her Tactical and Ultimate seemed they were becoming more and more obsolete. These are aimed to redistribute this big power differential between all of her abilities, making. and Care Package more powerful and effective, while tamping down on the highly binary and situational Combat Revive. Octane Stim Reduced cooldown between stims from to. Increased health cost from to Increased bullet spread while in the air and shooting from the low Launch Pad trajectory. Dev Note Octane continues to perform well after the latest. Too well? We still love the frequency of the Jump Pad, but we d to make using Stim something Octane thinks about doing at the right time, instead of always slamming it by default. Loba Burglar Best Friend Can now run and slide at full speed while aiming the bracelet and while the bracelet is in the air. Loba will no longer be slowed after translocating. Fixed a lot of bugs that caused bracelet tosses to fail. Black Market Boutique Increased cooldown from to. Horizon Gravity Lift Reduced lift speed by. Reduced acceleration. Limited the time you can sit at the top of Gravity Lift to seconds. Increased cooldown from to. Horizon s abilities will now get zapped by Wattson pylons. Dev Note Horizon is powerful and popular, but that not why we making these. We believe that mistakes in should be punishable, and when Horizon could just get herself out of bad positioning while popping a whole battery, this just was true. These have goals make it much more possible for enemies to shoot Horizon as she sits in her gravity lift and make gravity lift less of an impromptu sniper tower. Fuse Knuckle Cluster Fuse now has stacks of Knuckle Cluster. Reduced cooldown from to. Dev Note More help is coming, but we want to be very careful how we buff him so that he does just become the Legend that kills you with his abilities. Bangalore Smoke Launcher Thickened Bangalore s smoke. Dev Note Last we optimized Bangalore s smoke particles and inadvertently thinned them out. This aims to get her back to the original visuals while keeping the optimizations. Bloodhound No longer receives assists from Eye of the Allfather. Dev Note Bloodhound scan is, but the goal of this change in particular is to reconsider assists and their implications for Ranked Points. There enough intrinsic value in sonar scans, and it a slippery slope to consider crediting assists for other abilities. Crypto will remain an exception. The active nature of Crypto drone scan is notably different from the passive option with Bloodhound. This should encourage Bloodhound players to act on the information they get from the scan, to eliminate instances where they might try to snag a quick assist without committing to a fight in the same way Crypto has to. Crypto Crypto drone can now scan and open care packages. Can no longer use his drone to hijack a respawn beacon that already in use. Weapons Updates Marksman Weapon Category The Scout and the are currently in the Assault Rifle weapons category, but they are a bit strange in that category due to their firing style and some of their handling values. Similarly, the Triple Take felt a little out of place in the Sniper category. With the introduction of the Bocek bow, we felt it was a good time to introduce a weapons category, Marksman Weapons, which will include the,, Triple Take, and Bocek. Weapons in this category are precision weapons that are most effective up to range, and are the sort of of Assault Rifles and Snipers. This allows us to begin moving the settings of these weapons towards more consistent value for the class, and make the settings of ARs and Snipers more consistent with less outliers. For starters, we are increasing the movement speed while aiming down sights for marksman weapons They were at sniper speeds, and will now be between sniper and AR speeds. Additionally, we have done some targeted normalization of hipfire spread amounts. Supply Drop Rotation This season, we re taking the Peacekeeper out of the supply drop and putting the Triple Take in its place. Of course, with any supply drop change, these weapons will have their stats updated. See how each weapon down below. Crate Weapon Drop Rates Since we are exchanging a shotgun with a marksman weapon, now was a good time to rebalance the drop rates of crate weapons. The Kraber will spawn less often in the early and more often in the mid to better accommodate its power. The Triple Take will be the most common early crate weapon, with the Prowler being the most prominent late crate weapon. Fully Kitted Rotation Wingman, Bocek,, Hemlock, and Sentinel, Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, and Spitfire Hop Ups Shatter Caps Fire select to toggle between standard mode and shatter mode. In shatter mode, rounds split into a blast pattern on firing. This hop up will be equipable to the Repeater and the Bocek. Deadeye s Tempo Firing at the perfect moment increases fire rate. This can currently be attached to the Sentinel and the Bocek. To make room, the Hammerpoint and Skullpiercer hop ups are being vaulted for now, and won t be available. Assault Rifles Reducing the headshot multiplier for all assault rifles from to Dev Note This was already the case for the Hemlok, so the affected guns are the, Flatline, and Havoc. Peacekeeper It comes with the Precision Choke by default, which can be toggled off Pellet damage reduced from to Rechamber time increased from seconds to seconds Reload times increased regular from to, empty from to Pellet spread increased in general, and spread when charged increased for all charge levels from to Quickly loses charge after leaving ADS Dev Note Since the Peacekeeper is coming out of the crate, we are bringing many of the stats back in line with their previous values. We are reducing its damage potential and bringing in the effective range a bit since the Precision Choke is always available now. Triple Take As a crate weapon, it will come with a ammo clip and reserve ammo Fire rate increased from to Time to full charge reduced from seconds to second Retains charge briefly after leaving ADS while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased spread while airborne and aiming down sights Havoc Increased recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note This should help make up for the reduced headshot multiplier and make it a bit more usable in fights. Spitfire Reduced recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note The Spitfire is too at the moment, boasting good damage output with low recoil. Making it a bit harder to control early in the pattern should give more time for opponents to fight against it. That said, we re prepared to make more to the Spitfire if it remains too powerful. Repeater Increased leg damage multiplier from to while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons faster than snipers, slower than ARs Dev Note The could use some love, so we re bringing up the amount of leg damage it does. This should make it a bit more consistent without raising it s high best case damage potential. Scout while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased hipfire spread size reduced accuracy to be more in line with other marksman weapons Dev Note The Repeater and the Bocek Compound Bow have more accurate hipfire than the baseline marksman weapon values, so the Scout will be less accurate in hipfire than these other weapons. Longbow Increased headshot multiplier from to Wingman Increased headshot multiplier from to Dev Note As we ve done before when the Skullpiercer is out of the loot pool, we re giving the Longbow and Wingman a compensatory buff. Mozambique Increased magazine capacity from to Moved the lower pellets inward in the blast pattern Dev Note This brings up the baseline power level so only finding a Mozambique early in the match gives you more of a fighting chance, and makes up for the removal of Hammerpoints Increased bullet damage from to Lowered fire rate from to Dev Note Similar to the Mozambique, we want to bring up the s baseline power level a bit. Most players couldn t take advantage of the fast fire rate, so bringing that down while increasing the damage should help players win more early fights with the. Arc Stars Aim and movement slow from the initial stick. Dev Note Sticking someone should feel rewarding, considering it a rare occurrence that difficult to pull off. While an argument can be made that getting stuck should be a personal death sentence, the inability to at least relocate and spare teammates from the explosion makes it hard to against a coordinated. This change should help mitigate that without stripping away the satisfaction of hitting a nice stick. Quality of Life Badges are now sorted by categories and can be filtered by all or unlocked only. This suggestion came directly from players. Thank you! It s so much better! When looting death boxes, players can now see health bars for everyone on the.

Club Invites You can now include what you want to when you send your clubmates a party invite via the Club tab. Select as many club mates as you want to send the invite to at once via the member list. Ranked Fixed edge cases where an abandon penalty would be incorrectly applied due to server errors. Flight path adjustments Removing edge dropship flight paths to prevent matches where large portions of the map receive little to no traffic. These screenshots show a comparison of possible flight paths on Kings Canyon. Ring We continuing work from the Fight Night to improve match pacing towards the end of the. We slowing down the closing speed of the late Rings to allow you more time to fight and maneuver your way into the Ring. We reducing the waiting time before Rings and start to close. Ring time reduced from to Ring shrink speed reduced from second close time to seconds Ring shrink speed reduced from second close time to seconds Ring time reduced from to Ring shrink speed reduced from close time to Bug Fixes Bloodhound Fixed an issue with the Tactical UI not showing while in Bloodhound s Ultimate. Pathfinder Gas Traps and Jump Pads will no longer float into the sky when placed next to a zipline. Wraith Slight wall bumps no longer inadvertently cancel Wraith s tactical. Mirage Decoys no longer die after a tick of thermite damage. Octane Ordinances will no longer get stuck and disappear when being bounced off of Jump Pads.

And as it turns out, the first pitch document for Arenas was a by Auto Chess a pretty surprising choice given that royales and auto chess, erm, are particularly alike. It all made me wonder what sort of wacky experiments Respawn is carrying out behind the scenes, and what we could potentially see next. Could it be modes,, gauntlet runs? So I decided to put this question to Respawn in an interview with chief operating manager and general manager Dusty Welch, and director Chad Grenier. It seems that the is keen to venture further into areas such as PvE and pointed to previous experiments as an example. We dipped our toes in a PvE mode a few seasons back with quests, Grenier said.

Click the video down below to watch. for Legacy Arenas The are going underground with the introduction of a permanent mode Arenas. Fully reassembled and unimpressed with the glitz and glamor of the, former Predator Ash is taking the competition back to its roots. A purer form of combat. The rules are simple. Eliminate your enemies to win the round. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You win, or you die. Arenas features a set of custom maps, for combat with more to come in the future. Squads start each round in a spawn room, where they can get weapons, gear, and abilities, and adjust their loadout as their strategy. The first to win three rounds with at least a lead will be crowned the they to a tie. Then they ll have the honor of participating in Ash s favorite part of the Sudden Death. For more on Arenas, check out the blog for a full deep dive into the mode. Party Crasher Short version, Mirage took the voyage on a joyride and it didn t as planned. Party Crasher is of exciting custom arenas where you ll be able to show off your skills. This arena takes place in a ritzy, downtown plaza where players can choose to engage on the crashed Mirage Voyage, or the opulent story buildings that make up the downtown. Stay vigilante, as this map hosts a variety of engagement close quarters and long distance. Phase Runner The Phase Runner on Olympus is unique, but it wasn t the first of its kind. Phase Runner is the second of our custom arenas, and our largest. You ll fight in a hidden, experimental zone at the peak of a mountain where a prototype phase runner lays for use. This map gives you a lot of space to maneuver, so be sure to be on the lookout for those who prefer to be patient and take you out from afar. Sound tactics and clear communication are what you ll need to come out on top as you fight through the construction site or near the phase runner exit. In addition to the maps, other areas from our three BR maps will be thrown into a rotation, giving you five maps total for Arenas. At the start you ll get Artillery from Kings Canyon, Thermal Station from World s Edge, and Golden Gardens from Olympus. Valkyrie Kairi Imahara, the daughter of Predator Viper, salvaged the remains of her father Northstar Titan years after his death. With Rampart help, she fashioned it into a sleek jetpack that honors her family s legacy. Now, she s entered the under the name VALKYRIE. Passive VTOL Jets Use your jetpack to reposition or reach high places. You have limited fuel and can not use weapons while flying. Tactical Missile Swarm Fire a swarm of which damage and disorient the enemy. Ultimate Skyward dive Take to the skies to reposition a long distance across the map. Your squadmates can join in. Class Recon Scanning Survey Beacons reveals the next circle s location. Bocek The Bocek pronounced compound bow is a precision marksman weapon that rewards a skilled and confident hand. Holding down fire will draw the bow over a short time, increasing the power of the shot, with maximum power giving optimal damage and projectile speed. Repeatedly firing the Bocek right as it reaches max power provides the best sustained damage. The Bocek uses a ammo type, Arrows, which are unique to this weapon. Arrows are more rare on the battlefield, but fired arrows will stick into surfaces and remain in the world for players to pick back up and reuse. The hcog classic, holosight, hcog, variable, and hcog optics can all be equipped. The Bocek can be further modified with the entering the, Shatter Caps and Deadeye s Tempo it can even equip both simultaneously! Olympus The Lost Fleet A fleet of mysterious ships have made their way to Olympus and brought with them an otherworldly, parasitic plant that has begun to take root along the surface. The lead ship, The Icarus, has docked with the city and changed the landscape for good. Fight through the claustrophobic halls of the ghost ship, search corpses for a mysterious key card, and walk away as the last squad standing. our latest map blog to get a detailed look at what s changed on Olympus. To allow everyone to see the latest map, Olympus will be the only map in rotation for the first week of the season. Starter Kit and Loot Players will now start a match with a Starter Kit consisting of a Level EVO Shield, Helmet, and Knockdown Shield, plus Shield Cells and Syringes each. We ve Level Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the loot pool. Spawn chances for Level EVO Shields in the loot pool have been significantly reduced. Along with the lowered or spawn chances for these items, we ve rebalanced the loot pool such that versions of these items will appear nearly the same as they do now, but other item types will appear more often weapons, ordinance, health, ammo, etc. Dev note We wanted to take a crack at improving the loot for a while, with our design goals being to make picking up loot feel more impactful to the, and to thin out our loot a bit in general, since we always adding items to the pool. The recent Locked Loaded takeover mode helped us some of the we looking to make moving forward certain pieces of loot, and loot types specifically, are being put on notice. We removing Level Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the ground loot because these seemed the least exciting, least meaningful equipment pickups we had. Their power is practically invisible, so they do feel a character improvement in the way that things, say, a Backpack feels getting those extra slots feels SO chunky!. We keeping Level EVO Shields in the loot pool albeit at a lower spawn chance in addition to adding them to your starter kit because having them sprinkled around is still important for shenanigans. Finally, granting these pieces of gear from the start of the is intended to improve the hot drop situation having more health, some headshot damage reduction, and a little knockdown protection can help give players some more time to react to a chaotic hot drop than before. Be on the lookout for more loot in the future! This will be an ongoing project. Emotes Introducing Emotes! Every Legend will have emote unlocked at launch and additional emotes can be obtained through packs or by crafting them. Equip your emotes to the emote wheel and flex away! It s great fun to show off to your squadmates in the starting room of Arenas, and of course you have to use them on the Winner s podium. Now, since emotes kick your camera back to a view, we know some folks are already thinking about corner peeking. Competitive integrity is still paramount, so enemies that your character couldn t see in view will not be shown while you are in third person. This video shows the feature working on the purple Dummie behind the rock. Without it, Pathfinder would be able to use the person camera to gain knowledge that he shouldn t have. All emotes have enabled and there is no way to disable it. Battlepass Unlock the premium Legacy Pass and level it up to unlock skins Rampart s Crafty Kitsune at Premium Level and Wraith s Demon s Whisper at Premium Level. Legend Updates Low Profile Characters Low profile no longer exists! This trait has been from Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson. Dev Note After our successful experiment with Wraith hitboxes, we are now confident that we can solve balance issues between smaller and larger through to their kits and hitboxes. It is finally time for Low Profile to the way of the dodo. Sorry dodos. Lifeline Combat Revive No longer deploys a shield. Can now revive players at the same time. Can now cancel active revives in progress to allow your teammate to defend themselves with their knockdown shield.. Heal Drone Heal rate increased from per second to per second. Deployment time before healing begins reduced by roughly. Care Package Cooldown reduced from minutes to minutes. Now guarantees an upgrade if possible in three categories Body Shield, Other Equipment Helmet, Backpack, and Knockdown Shield, and Weapon Attachment, based on your s current gear when the Package arrives. Dev Note Lifeline s kit was not in a particularly healthy place. The Passive shield was extremely to the point of frustration, while her Tactical and Ultimate seemed they were becoming more and more obsolete. These are aimed to redistribute this big power differential between all of her abilities, making. and Care Package more powerful and effective, while tamping down on the highly binary and situational Combat Revive. Octane Stim Reduced cooldown between stims from to. Increased health cost from to Increased bullet spread while in the air and shooting from the low Launch Pad trajectory. Dev Note Octane continues to perform well after the latest. Too well? We still love the frequency of the Jump Pad, but we d to make using Stim something Octane thinks about doing at the right time, instead of always slamming it by default. Loba Burglar Best Friend Can now run and slide at full speed while aiming the bracelet and while the bracelet is in the air. Loba will no longer be slowed after translocating. Fixed a lot of bugs that caused bracelet tosses to fail. Black Market Boutique Increased cooldown from to. Horizon Gravity Lift Reduced lift speed by. Reduced acceleration. Limited the time you can sit at the top of Gravity Lift to seconds. Increased cooldown from to. Horizon s abilities will now get zapped by Wattson pylons. Dev Note Horizon is powerful and popular, but that not why we making these. We believe that mistakes in should be punishable, and when Horizon could just get herself out of bad positioning while popping a whole battery, this just was true. These have goals make it much more possible for enemies to shoot Horizon as she sits in her gravity lift and make gravity lift less of an impromptu sniper tower. Fuse Knuckle Cluster Fuse now has stacks of Knuckle Cluster. Reduced cooldown from to. Dev Note More help is coming, but we want to be very careful how we buff him so that he does just become the Legend that kills you with his abilities. Bangalore Smoke Launcher Thickened Bangalore s smoke. Dev Note Last we optimized Bangalore s smoke particles and inadvertently thinned them out. This aims to get her back to the original visuals while keeping the optimizations. Bloodhound No longer receives assists from Eye of the Allfather. Dev Note Bloodhound scan is, but the goal of this change in particular is to reconsider assists and their implications for Ranked Points. There enough intrinsic value in sonar scans, and it a slippery slope to consider crediting assists for other abilities. Crypto will remain an exception. The active nature of Crypto drone scan is notably different from the passive option with Bloodhound. This should encourage Bloodhound players to act on the information they get from the scan, to eliminate instances where they might try to snag a quick assist without committing to a fight in the same way Crypto has to. Crypto Crypto drone can now scan and open care packages. Can no longer use his drone to hijack a respawn beacon that already in use. Weapons Updates Marksman Weapon Category The Scout and the are currently in the Assault Rifle weapons category, but they are a bit strange in that category due to their firing style and some of their handling values. Similarly, the Triple Take felt a little out of place in the Sniper category. With the introduction of the Bocek bow, we felt it was a good time to introduce a weapons category, Marksman Weapons, which will include the,, Triple Take, and Bocek. Weapons in this category are precision weapons that are most effective up to range, and are the sort of of Assault Rifles and Snipers. This allows us to begin moving the settings of these weapons towards more consistent value for the class, and make the settings of ARs and Snipers more consistent with less outliers. For starters, we are increasing the movement speed while aiming down sights for marksman weapons They were at sniper speeds, and will now be between sniper and AR speeds. Additionally, we have done some targeted normalization of hipfire spread amounts. Supply Drop Rotation This season, we re taking the Peacekeeper out of the supply drop and putting the Triple Take in its place. Of course, with any supply drop change, these weapons will have their stats updated. See how each weapon down below. Crate Weapon Drop Rates Since we are exchanging a shotgun with a marksman weapon, now was a good time to rebalance the drop rates of crate weapons. The Kraber will spawn less often in the early and more often in the mid to better accommodate its power. The Triple Take will be the most common early crate weapon, with the Prowler being the most prominent late crate weapon. Fully Kitted Rotation Wingman, Bocek,, Hemlock, and Sentinel, Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, and Spitfire Hop Ups Shatter Caps Fire select to toggle between standard mode and shatter mode. In shatter mode, rounds split into a blast pattern on firing. This hop up will be equipable to the Repeater and the Bocek. Deadeye s Tempo Firing at the perfect moment increases fire rate. This can currently be attached to the Sentinel and the Bocek. To make room, the Hammerpoint and Skullpiercer hop ups are being vaulted for now, and won t be available. Assault Rifles Reducing the headshot multiplier for all assault rifles from to Dev Note This was already the case for the Hemlok, so the affected guns are the, Flatline, and Havoc. Peacekeeper It comes with the Precision Choke by default, which can be toggled off Pellet damage reduced from to Rechamber time increased from seconds to seconds Reload times increased regular from to, empty from to Pellet spread increased in general, and spread when charged increased for all charge levels from to Quickly loses charge after leaving ADS Dev Note Since the Peacekeeper is coming out of the crate, we are bringing many of the stats back in line with their previous values. We are reducing its damage potential and bringing in the effective range a bit since the Precision Choke is always available now. Triple Take As a crate weapon, it will come with a ammo clip and reserve ammo Fire rate increased from to Time to full charge reduced from seconds to second Retains charge briefly after leaving ADS while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased spread while airborne and aiming down sights Havoc Increased recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note This should help make up for the reduced headshot multiplier and make it a bit more usable in fights. Spitfire Reduced recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note The Spitfire is too at the moment, boasting good damage output with low recoil. Making it a bit harder to control early in the pattern should give more time for opponents to fight against it. That said, we re prepared to make more to the Spitfire if it remains too powerful. Repeater Increased leg damage multiplier from to while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons faster than snipers, slower than ARs Dev Note The could use some love, so we re bringing up the amount of leg damage it does. This should make it a bit more consistent without raising it s high best case damage potential. Scout while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased hipfire spread size reduced accuracy to be more in line with other marksman weapons Dev Note The Repeater and the Bocek Compound Bow have more accurate hipfire than the baseline marksman weapon values, so the Scout will be less accurate in hipfire than these other weapons. Longbow Increased headshot multiplier from to Wingman Increased headshot multiplier from to Dev Note As we ve done before when the Skullpiercer is out of the loot pool, we re giving the Longbow and Wingman a compensatory buff. Mozambique Increased magazine capacity from to Moved the lower pellets inward in the blast pattern Dev Note This brings up the baseline power level so only finding a Mozambique early in the match gives you more of a fighting chance, and makes up for the removal of Hammerpoints Increased bullet damage from to Lowered fire rate from to Dev Note Similar to the Mozambique, we want to bring up the s baseline power level a bit. Most players couldn t take advantage of the fast fire rate, so bringing that down while increasing the damage should help players win more early fights with the. Arc Stars Aim and movement slow from the initial stick. Dev Note Sticking someone should feel rewarding, considering it a rare occurrence that difficult to pull off. While an argument can be made that getting stuck should be a personal death sentence, the inability to at least relocate and spare teammates from the explosion makes it hard to against a coordinated. This change should help mitigate that without stripping away the satisfaction of hitting a nice stick. Quality of Life Badges are now sorted by categories and can be filtered by all or unlocked only. This suggestion came directly from players. Thank you! It s so much better! When looting death boxes, players can now see health bars for everyone on the. Challenges can now be favorited by going into the challenges menu and right clicking a challenge.

This is only available on PC. Players can now request better equipment by going into their inventory and pinging a piece of equipment. Your first Challenge Reroll of the day is now free. Rerolling your challenges will allow you to choose from either challenges or ones. Holo Sprays, Quips, and Emotes, can be favorited. These will be used whenever the is prompted to do a random emote. Club Invites You can now include what you want to when you send your clubmates a party invite via the Club tab. Select as many club mates as you want to send the invite to at once via the member list. Ranked Fixed edge cases where an abandon penalty would be incorrectly applied due to server errors. Flight path adjustments Removing edge dropship flight paths to prevent matches where large portions of the map receive little to no traffic. These screenshots show a comparison of possible flight paths on Kings Canyon. Ring We continuing work from the Fight Night to improve match pacing towards the end of the. We slowing down the closing speed of the late Rings to allow you more time to fight and maneuver your way into the Ring. We reducing the waiting time before Rings and start to close. Ring time reduced from to Ring shrink speed reduced from second close time to seconds Ring shrink speed reduced from second close time to seconds Ring time reduced from to Ring shrink speed reduced from close time to Bug Fixes Bloodhound Fixed an issue with the Tactical UI not showing while in Bloodhound s Ultimate. Pathfinder Gas Traps and Jump Pads will no longer float into the sky when placed next to a zipline. Wraith Slight wall bumps no longer inadvertently cancel Wraith s tactical. Mirage Decoys no longer die after a tick of thermite damage. Octane Ordinances will no longer get stuck and disappear when being bounced off of Jump Pads. Death Totems will no longer bounce when a Jump Pad is placed under it. Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the Fight Night ring via a Jump Pad.

The introduction of a performance display in Season meant players could report their problems more accurately, and Respawn began tracking key performance metrics for players and servers.

Since we re launching a few weeks after the start of Season, Switch players will be granted free levels for their Season Pass. For the first weeks after launch, playing on Switch will earn you double XP. Plus, to celebrate Switch players and welcome them to the arena, we re launching a Legendary Pathfinder skin called. as a free reward for players who boot up on Switch between the s launch and the end of Season Mayhem May,. CAUSTIC TOWN TAKEOVER When life gives you lemons, you can count on Caustic to turn it into toxic lemonade. Breathe it in at the Caustic Treatment a dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all who seek the glorious cheese. Where Water Treatment once stood, the Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? Forever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires test subjects to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly. If you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it. RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT Ring Fury is a playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. Those who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round s Ring. You ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. will call out if they are in direct danger or if there s opening up nearby. So how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a item we re introducing called Heat Shields. HEAT SHIELDS During the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares or from the ring itself! and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map. Heat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by and the speed of Revives is increased by. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and do grant this bonus. But watch out The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don t expect it to last very long in the final rounds. After the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the as general ground loot. SURVIVAL SLOT You ll notice that the Heat Shield does take up any of your normal inventory, it resides in the brand Survival Slot. The Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there s no reason not to carry of these around. Coordinate with your, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars! the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected. However, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an Escalation Takeover, which means that every few days during the event, we re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting! Good luck out there. MATCHMAKING TL DR Matchmaking is a way to the as a solo Legend. Here s how it works, and why you might choose to use it. In the lobby, you ll now see a checkbox entitled Fill Matchmaking. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you. Unchecking this box and clicking will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with Fill Matchmaking unchecked, you ll in alone. You ll be on a of, against teams of three. We still strongly believe that, at its best, is a about teamplay. But we re launching this matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to the your way. Here s some things you might want to use Matchmaking for Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights Challenge you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios? Experience the latest lore teaser on your own Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven t tried before Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the at your own pace. We have some limitations in place for matchmaking, because we don t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the for other players. We only allow potential players in any match, and the feature isn t available in Ranked. Give it a shot and let us know what you think. CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK It ain t a Collection Event without unlockables. Let s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and weapon skins among the goodies. You can earn points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges stack with your Pass, so you can complete multiple at once. And of course, Chaos Theory introduces a brand set of themed, cosmetics. Inspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our are donning fierce looks as they drop into the arena. All items will be available through direct purchase for Coins or Crafting Metals and in Event Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all event items, you ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. Bangalore took this Pilot s knife off a opponent. Since that day, she s made it her own. After the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. A few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work First, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended. Second, each Event Pack will come with event item and items at the following drop rates Other than that, it s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Cosmetics work, visit our FAQ. LEGEND UPDATES Caustic Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from minutes to minutes. Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of per tick instead of ramping up from. Dev note Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead seems a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these hit Caustic s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly. Pathfinder Low Profile Dev Note Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile small. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size. Gibraltar faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection. Horizon Increased Black Hole cooldown from minutes to minutes Revenant Revenant s Silence now disables Mirage s cloaked revive respawn as well as Octane s Swift Mend. Wattson Wattson now has passive shield regen at half of Octane s current health regen rate. Rampart Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting damage. Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting damage. Dev Note Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This was necessary, as it turns out, so we removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila. WEAPON Weapon Optics All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to Bruiser. Mastiff Pellet damage decreased from. Fire rate increased from. Dev Note The goal of these are to place this weapon s identity between the fast fire and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of pumps players experience on the receiving end. Wingman bullet to every magazine size, including base. Hemlok Increased spread. Dev Note The burst damage from the Hemlok was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end. QUALITY OF LIFE Kings Canyon Loot we ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High. Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship. Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality. Locked Weapon Optic Swapping For guns with fully locked attachment slots, gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight. This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle. Assists have been to the HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been to unranked. Assists still don t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator eye icon. Assists and Knocks have been to your squad s banners and will show at the end of a match. Club names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. Items will no longer stick to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator. Badge Progress for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you re trying to get wins as Lifeline, you ll now see that you have instead of somewhere between and. Ping My Deathbox While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. Gold Backpack Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of on the tier of armor they the revive is taking place. They will display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress. Players on PC can now back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the. numbers to the Advanced Look Controls.

I ve been at Respawn since the studio s formation in and have had the privilege to work on many great, including from the very beginning. In just a few days we will be celebrating our year anniversary so we ve been doing some reflecting and reminiscing on how we ve gotten to where we are today. I d to take a brief moment to share a bit of the story. ORIGIN STORY LAUNCH After shipping Titanfall we were hard at work on Titanfall content and naturally starting to explore ideas for another. wasn t even a thought yet. We were discussing and trying ideas, playtesting prototype campaign ideas, playing modes, and designers started a small prototype that would change the course of our. Almost years before the release of, we had our first playtest on a mode called Survival where pilots and Titans would fight it out to be the last man standing, style. Early survival mode put pilots into a drop ship where they would form teams of by running to and entering the same droppod together Our prototype map called real big map was quite different than Kings Canyon in that it was more sparse and allowed for Titans to roam freely Fast forward another month, and the working on this mode had grown to over people. In October of we saw the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith in, in November of we did our first successfully and had just begun playtesting on a map that would eventually be called Kings Canyon. The earliest recognizable image of Kings Canyon. Before town names they were simply called zones The gameplay improved over time, with Titans and wallrunning being to slow down the pace of the and bring more balance to the gameplay. Of course, we tried to keep Titans in the for many months, but once we accepted that we were making something fundamentally different from Titanfall, we entered a phase. Company playtests were happening weekly, and often running late into the night. We couldn t stop playing! There was a leaderboard on the chalkboard in the kitchen showing who had the most wins. The company had become consumed with playing this mode we were building. A chalkboard in the studio keeps track of Friday Night Fights playtest winners The name of the turned from Survival to Predator. Kings Canyon became more Kings Canyon we know today. We began prototyping mechanics respawning teammates and legend abilities. We would the entire to playtest without headsets, and with names turned off, so we could build a best in class communication system. It became clear to us that we had something great on our hands, and our plans for the other project were scrapped. We were then on what would eventually be called and would never look back. Of course, thinking you have a great on your hands doesn t mean the world will love what you ve created so we were all very anxious to see how our did at launch. Knowing that many of our fans would be expecting another traditional Titanfall, we opted to with a secret launch so players could immediately the when they first heard about it. We knew players would love the if they could just it. A few days before launch we held a private event in Los Angeles to show the to top streamers, content creators, and media. After a presentation they got to the for hours. hours turned into eight, and they didn t want to put it down. The was starting to become overwhelmed with excitement! On Feb, we would launch our to the world surprise. We hoped some players would download the and love it, but knew that creating a was more about longevity and building over time, as opposed to a blockbuster boxed launch. I remember of our live ops engineers responsible for ensuring our servers work at scale setting expectations and telling the Don t expect a million players right out of the gate, or even within the first few months! As the entire stood in the kitchen staring at our projector screen we counted down together the seconds until the launched. By the time the champagne toasts and cheers had settled down we already had tens of thousands of players in! Eight hours later while we re still at work we hit a million players. We of course had to give that live ops engineer some crap! Three days later, we stood in the same kitchen and counted down to million players, and then days after launch hit million players. TOWARD AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE Since launch we ve had eight season launches, over a dozen lore events paired with original video content and over a dozen major events. We ve maps, vehicles, eight, and countless other modes and improvements to the. The continues to grow. Next month, we ll launch on Nintendo Switch. Work on a mobile version of is well underway. And later this year, we ll launch ways to the that take us beyond. We ve learned how to run a successful live service, how important sentiment is, and how it s entirely possible to captivate users with storytelling in a multiplayer. For us, is more than a. It brings people together, it unifies players, it entertains, it takes our minds off of the real world, even if just for minutes a day. It s an avenue for artists, writers, streamers, and content creators to express themselves. It s a that takes a stance on the importance of diversity. We ve heard stories from players all over the world about how our has kept friends and family members connected during the pandemic and how some of our innovations, such as the ping system, have made multiplayer more accessible. We ve even heard heartfelt stories from our fans about how helped save their lives. It s you, the players, that motivate us to create, it always has been. Thank you for playing,. Your support and love over the last years have been an overwhelmingly positive driving as we continue to make all it can be. We hope you enjoy the launch of Season Mayhem, and all the rest to come.

According to the a blog post by director Chad Grenier, the prototype was initially made by designers, and was then developed into a mode called Survival which allowed pilots and titans to it out to be last man standing. It seems the mode had a slightly smaller lobby size than, with a total of pilots instead of, but the idea of teams of three dropping together was present even in these very early stages. Squads would arrive in style inside a drop pod, however, which teams would have to enter as a trio inside the drop ship. Soon, size grew to over people, and by October Respawn had the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith.

Season Mayhem brings the boom starting February at PT. on for details. DEVSTREAM Join the designers as they break down the most explosive updates coming in Season. MEET FUSE Meet Fuse a fighter who never turns down a good. His affinity for explosions allows him to carry extra grenades and to throw them faster and further. He can launch a cluster bomb with airburst explosives. And when it s time to bring the boom, Fuse uses Wally to launch a bombardment that encircles an area in a ring of flames. Passive Grenadier Stack an extra grenade per inventory slot. Fire grenades farther, faster, and more accurately. Tactical Knuckle Cluster Launch a cluster bomb that continuously expels airburst explosives on impact. Ultimate The Motherlode Launch a bombardment that encircles a target area in a wall of flames. WEAPON REPEATER This heavy ammo repeater boasts rounds that ll nail a fleeing Mirage at paces. The is the benchmark for reliability, designed to withstand whipping sandstorms and temporal instability, which made it an obvious choice for the. DISCIPLINED TRIGGER FINGER The Repeater requires the user to rechamber their rounds between shots which brings a methodic rhythm to the rifle, an analogue elegance that the modern weapons of the Outlands just can t quite capture. To further tempt those itchy trigger fingers, the Repeater has a charge giving players an opportunity to deal increased damage with each shot at the cost of a short. The reloads round at a time, which makes for some very interesting resource management you won t find anywhere else, even on the Mastiff. The s engagement range allows unique opportunities to reload individual rounds between shots. This gives the Repeater the ability to lay down consistent precision ranged pressure, something weapons with full reloads can sometimes struggle with. KINGS CANYON MAP Season once again sees to Kings Canyon. The main point of interest shows the devastation from the ship crashing into the map. Players can now explore beyond Artillery, Spotted Lakes takes over the Slums and some observation towers for basic recon or a sniper s nest. more on the map in the map blog here. LEGENDARY MAGAZINES Season introduces the magazines. Attaching it to a weapon automatically reloads your stowed weapons after a brief delay. The Gold magazine has the same capacity as Purple mags, and is available for Light, Heavy, Snipers, and Energy Weapons. QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES Damage We have now a damage to the HUD. This was a highly requested feature, so we re excited to allow people easier tracking for chasing those badges and challenges! Pinging Ammo Pinging weapons or ammo in your inventory displays your current ammo count along with wants ammo in quick chat. Color Blind Healing and reviving will now follow colorblind rules when colorblind settings are enabled Lore Blurbs on Canon Skins Some of our skins are canon, and some are just for fun. For the skins that represent an important part of that character backstory, we a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the Legend life. LEGEND META Wraith Hitbox adjustments. Dev Note We know Wraith will always be a popular pick considering the amount of combat utility in her kit. After many tweaks to her abilities and animations, the fact remains that her win rate continues to be at the very top as it has since day. With Season hitbox adjustments to Pathfinder, we were able to control his power without nerfing his kit. We hope to do the same with Wraith. Wraith now has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small, but the stay true to her model. As you can see in the before and after comparison, we re adding some width mostly in the torso and leg areas. Even with these, Wraith remains small and hard to hit. She will retain Low Profile as we monitor her usage and win rates to see if power can be given back in other ways in the future. Rampart Sheila angle increase from to Wall health in build phase increased from to sniper rounds still pierce through Dev Note Rampart has remained at the bottom across our performance metrics since her release. Her kit is very much built around proactively setting up a powerful position, but in a as as, we determined her walls should have some reactive power as well. We re keeping a careful eye on this. Horizon Gravity Lift effective cooldown increased from to. The cooldown timer will now start when the Gravity Lift disappears. Dev Note Horizon, to the point where she Wraith in win rate and pick rate. For the time being, we are monitoring her usage and checking whether or not the cooldown have a significant effect. Octane Launch Pad Remastered Many players may have known about Octane s that was possible with a jump while hitting the pad. Once the option was introduced, there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage. We decided to add some launch options that are better defined than the old. Hitting the jump pad from a standing position will launch players along a high arc the speed and trajectory of the old. From a crouched position, players will launch along a low arc, meaning they ll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction. Crypto Remove ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones. Loba Loot inside unopened care packages is now visible with Eye for Quality and accessible through the Black Market Boutique. Caustic All gas now dissipates as soon as Caustic s is eliminated. Mirage Mirage decoys create footstep sounds. Dev Note This change was mistakenly mentioned in the Fight Night notes when it was in fact coming with this. Mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity. There won t be a footstep tornado if an enemy Mirage ults nearby, but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real Mirage from audio cues alone.

Season Legend Horizon Meet Horizon! She s the newest Legend, a brilliant scientist, and a master of gravity manipulation. She has a deep connection to the arena, and a motivation that will tug at your heartstrings. Horizon s custom space suit allows her to fall from great heights and control her movements in the air. Using her custom technology, she can use gravity lifts to give her a vertical boost, and she can even deploy NEWT her small robot named after her son, Newton to drop a micro black hole that pulls opponents into the center for some serious crowd control. Passive Spacewalk Increase air control and reduce fall impacts with Horizon s custom spacesuit. Tactical Gravity Lift Reverse the flow of gravity, lifting players upward and boosting them outward when they exit. Ultimate Black hole Deploy NEWT to create a micro black hole that sucks in nearby. Map Olympus The have entered a arena the sky city of Olympus. A utopia floating in clouds above Psamathe, it was once a place where the brightest minds in the Outlands could gather and exchange ideas. However, an accident in an experimental research facility led to the creation of the Phase Rift a massive bubble of Phase energy, and the city was abandoned. Now players can use Olympus luxurious amenities to their advantage. Rotating agricultural towers, beautiful gardens and classy restaurants serve as stages for intense skirmishes. vehicles called Tridents give your squad a way to boost into and take your enemies by surprise. The Phase Runner a tunnel of Phase energy running through the center of Olympus lets you cross the map in seconds. And the Rift stands tall over everything, mysterious and beckoning... Vehicle The Trident Exclusive to Olympus, the Trident is a hover car designed for your whole squad. Cruise the highways to avoid chokepoints or use the boost to soar over jumps, this thing is made to speed up those early rotations. Drive in third person, or ride as a passenger in first person with full shooting capabilities. The Trident is durable, so it will never explode, but damage applied from enemy fire will be dispersed amongst the players in the car. Don t worry, you can still do full damage to players by hitting them directly so we expect to see some amazing Kraber shots. Disembark to park it anywhere and use it as makeshift cover in the late. The Trident interacts with Legend abilities in many different ways, experiment and have fun! LTM Olympus Preview To help you understand and explore the map without fear of getting shot, we are introducing a playlist called Olympus Preview. This mode teams you up with on Olympus and allows you to roam the map to learn map drops, loot areas, and practice your routes to the end. Circles are still on and once circle finishes, players are brought back up to the plane to start the second skydive run. There are a total of runs before the match ends. This mode is only available for week. Clubs With this season, we are introducing clubs. Join a club with minded and make it easier to find your champion squad. Don t see a particular club you, then create and let your friends know to join! more on cubs here. Boot up and start downloading and! If you re coming from Origin, all your progress and unlocks will carry over. And for a limited time, log into and receive these and Portal inspired weapon charms. Pass The Season Pass is all about that high fashion. Level up your Pass to unlock the skins the Wraith High Class and Octane s Fast Fashion. Challenges are no longer and are now granted between to stars, depending on their difficulty. Collecting stars will take you to the next Pass level. We have tabs to the challenges menu in the lobby that allow you to toggle between daily, top weekly, and event challenges. Within a match, players can open the map and see this same widget in. For more on the to Challenges, check out this dev blog. Quality of Life Updates Attachment Swap Improvements When replacing an attachment with from the ground, if the old attachment is an improvement for your other weapon, the old attachment will get automatically transferred. Replicator Updates For Season, we have weapons from the crafting pool and have replaced them with Shield batteries. The high level attachments will still be tailored towards a weapon category. We now prevent other players from picking up items that you crafted for the first seconds after crafting. This can be disabled by pinging the item. Air Drop Clarity The colors of the beams have been changed to differentiate between normal airdrops, Lifeline airdrops, and Replicator airdrops. Normal drops are a light tan, Lifeline drops are blue, and Replicator drops and teal. All of the airdrops landing area FX while it coming down matches their colors. Airdrop beams still stay visible when close to the airdrop, instead of fading when you get close. The beam still disappears when the pod is opened. Misc The Arc Star now shows an Arc Star model when is thrown near you, instead of a grenade. a VO line when you are using a Phoenix Kit a VO line when you drop a Holo Spray You can now ping ammo in your inventory to request more from your squad Made modifications to The Ring to reduce the amount of unplayable space in the circles. Map Rotations Regular Map Rotation For weeks, Olympus will be the only map you can on. After that week we into a normal rotation between Olympus and World s Edge. We will be vaulting Kings Canyon for the time being. Season Ranked Rotation The first half of Ranked Split will be played on Olympus. The second half of ranked will be played on World s Edge. For more information on this season s ranked updates, check out the ranked blog here. Legend Meta Bangalore Rolling Thunder Reduced the time it takes for explosion from seconds to seconds. Dev Note Not much to say here. Rolling Thunder will continue to function primarily as a zoning ability, but with a somewhat shorter fuse, it will encourage enemies to leave the zone slightly faster. Caustic Nox Gas Gas Grenade no longer get a blurred vision effect while in the gas. Damage updated from ticks of damage to ticks of damage. Dev Note Fighting in Caustic Gas is of the most frustrating things in, and yet we need the gas to represent a meaningful threat or else enemies will just ignore it. With this change we re attacking what we think is the greatest contributor to this frustration the fact that your vision is blurred while you re in gas. This made it extremely hard to fight back. To make up for lost power, we re upping the damage from the gas a bit. Mirage Psyche of the Party Decoys now have health Dev Note Our is a hard Legend to keep relevant. Every time we make a change to decoys, there is a clear uptick in usage and power as Mirage mains learn to use their tools, and then as the rest of the world catches on and starts being able to tell the real Mirage from his equally handsome holographs, that uptick disappears. This time around we want to try and make it a little bit harder to clear out decoys. We re giving them health, but to make this very clear up front they will not work as a shield. While they take damage from bullets, the bullet passes through them and hits whatever s behind them. This is what we call the hallway test you should not be able to win an engagement against an enemy in a straight coverless hallway by snapcasting a decoy and having said decoy eat an entire Wingman shot. Decoys will unique hit effects and briefly flicker out of existence when taking damage to help you differentiate between them and the real Mirage. Octane Swift Mend Doubled healing rate from to Dev note Octane is a Legend for players who to fast, run face first into the enemy, and get knocked down a lot. We think that s absolutely fine the fact that his Trios winrate isn t great doesn t bother us because both his encounter win rate think of this as his ability to score knockdowns and his pick rate are very healthy. That said, we figured we could give him a little extra out of combat help. His passive s heal rate was very slow, requiring up to to fully heal your health bar. Wattson Perimeter Security Increased damage per touch from to. Dev Note Wattson is the not super powerful individually, not picked very often at all below Plat, but an absolute must have for competitive squads. We re happy with that niche, but figured it would be safe to give her a little extra power in her best case people running into her fences. We re aiming for this to bring up her power and attractiveness at lower levels of especially, since we don t see a lot of players run into Wattson fences in high skill matches. Loba Black Market Ammo taken no longer counts towards Black Market s maximum. You can scoop up all the ammo in range. Dev Note We re taking another swing at making Loba the ultimate Legend to bring to solve all of your s loot needs. We have heard your feedback that you want improvements to her tactical as well, and while that s certainly not off the table, our data suggest that her encounter win rate how many knockdowns she gets compared to how many times she s knocked down, across all matches is quite healthy. It s her Trios winrate that s worryingly low. Make no mistake this is a major swing at making Black Market powerful. Rampart Sheila Now takes seconds to fully spin up, down from seconds. Amped Wall Now takes seconds to fully build, down from seconds. Dev Note In, we made a small change to how long it takes Sheila to tighten her bullet spread. This didn t meaningfully increase her winrate. The other half of that change is in this. We do not want to change Rampart away from being a Legend that requires setup, but we do want to make it faster to set up. Amped Wall should remain a mostly out of combat setup ability rather than a reactive ability and Sheila should remain an area denial tool rather than a murder machine, but all things, these balance points exist on a spectrum, and with this we re moving them slightly closer to machine territory. Pathfinder Dev Note Pathfinder continues to be an overachiever in terms of win rate. The good news is that his grapple change in didn t move his win rate by much it went up in total. We re doing things this we re adjusting his hitboxes and we re putting in tuning for Grappling Hook that will firmly move it into buff territory. More context below! Hitbox Pathfinder has a tall but extremely skinny hitbox. A lot of his model isn t actually shootable and particularly his arms and legs do not represent a lot of shootable area either. Here is a before and after comparison of Pathfinder s hitboxes As you can see, there is still a lot of negative space around his arms and legs. We re hoping that by making it a little easier to hit Pathfinder, we can bring his win rate under control to the point where we can put meaningful power into his kit. Because the question is sure to come up we are not yet removing Low Profile from Pathfinder with this change. Even with these increased hitboxes, Pathfinder will still be considerably harder to hit than most other characters in the. If this change does make a meaningful difference in terms of his win rate we will drop Low Profile but we didn t want to take it off him this only to have to put it back next when it turns out his winrate spiked. Grappling Hook We re making a number of to Grappling Hook. In we shipped a very conservative version of this change now that we know this didn t meaningfully affect his winrate or, anecdotally, how frustrating it is to fight him, we re shipping the much more aggressive version of the changelist. We want to make it clear that players should not be punished for chaining grappling hook perfectly into other movement mechanics. Pathfinder no longer needs to be on the ground for Grappling Hook to be considered finished. The speed to which Pathfinder needs to drop for us to consider Grappling Hook finished was increased from to The maximum cooldown grapple can be set to was lowered to seconds, from seconds the maximum amount of travel time before a cooldown is set is now seconds, rather than being uncapped. This means that effectively, you can never incur more than a second cooldown. The amount of distance you can travel before you hit maximum cooldown was roughly doubled. Weapon Meta Supply Drop Out of Supply Drop The will be returning to the normal loot pool this season, with the same stats it had before it went into the supply drop at the start of season. Damage from Care Package version to normal Ammo Prowler Into Supply Drop The prowler is replacing the in the supply drop. Despite the Selectfire being from the loot pool this season, the Prowler will still have the ability to change between round bursts and. Magazine size reserve ammo Fully Kitted Weapons Devotion, Mastiff, Triple Take, Flatline, Volt Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc,, Alternator Hemlok Increasing horizontal recoil of the first shots slightly to the right first burst when in burst mode Increasing recoil magnitude in the later stages of the pattern Reducing recoil multiplier in single fire mode to help compensate for additional recoil in pattern. Recoil should mostly be increased in burst mode rather than single fire mode Reducing headshot multiplier damage headshot against no helmet base character Dev Notes While we are happy to see the Hemlok get more attention with the recent buffs, we think it is a little too in season. The effective range of the burst mode felt a bit too far, and the spike damage capabilities of a full headshot burst were too in high level. Havoc Updated recoil pattern. Kicks up, then right, then left, then up again. Dev Notes With, the Havoc got a recoil pattern. This recoil pattern was a bit too erratic and difficult to control, due to multiple rapid in direction. We have adjusted the recoil pattern to have the same general movement while simplifying the motions required to control the pattern. LSTAR LSTAR has a recoil pattern that kicks horizontally at first and then settles into a relatively consistent upward recoil. Players who feather the trigger will be able to keep the LSTAR in the good portion of the recoil pattern. LSTAR venting time after letting of the trigger has been reduced. LSTAR will now reduce heat faster when not overheated from to charge if not overheated, still if overheated. Dev Notes The LSTAR had some limitations that caused it to feel worse than we d. The recoil pattern snaked back and forth, which was difficult to control reliably. Additionally, firing for short bursts and then releasing the trigger repeatedly, or feathering the trigger, felt somewhat clunky due to the long venting time after firing and the slow heat reduction. So, we are reducing those pain points to improve the viability and feel of feathering the trigger, and adjusting the recoil pattern to reward players who can effectively control the LSTAR s heat. Sentinel Energized Sentinel now has a pure damage increase, instead of bonus damage only vs shields Energized Sentinel base damage Dev Notes The Sentinel was still a bit weak. We think a good place to improve it is the energize ability. It seems a bit too situational, only being a benefit if the opponent has shields. So, we are changing the energize from a disruptor effect to an amp damage boost effect. Triple Take Fire rate Dev Note The Triple Take is still performing a bit too well after the most recent nerf, so we are reducing the fire rate back to what it was before the. We will be watching in the future to see how just the integrated choke, sniper ammo increase, and popularity affect the weapon s performance. Quickdraw Holster This attaches to the and Wingman. When equipped, the gun becomes quicker to raise and lower, takes less time to ADS, and has reduced hipfire spread particularly when not actively moving. This should open up opportunities to use the weapons, especially in combat. The Selectfire Receiver will be from the loot pool to make room. Meta Evo Armor requirements increased We increased the requirements to evolve Evo Armor in order to reduce the amount of players with Red Evo Armor during the end. Level damage from Level damage from Level damage from Level damage from Ring damage reduced Ring per tick same Ring per tick from Particularly this change should allow players enough time to pop a syringe if they are picked up in Ring. Ring per tick from Ring per tick from Ring per tick from Ring per tick from Ring per tick from Bug Fixes Audio We ve made some advancements in footstep audio playing more reliably. We have more work being done that we ll continue to roll out as it gets completed. Pathfinder Fixed an issue with ziplines going through platforms when deployed from underneath. Wraith Fixed an issue with priming a grenade cancelling Wraith ultimate. Octane Fixed an issue with getting stuck in double jump after using a jump pad. Fixed an issue with Octane being able to use healing items while on a zipline. Crypto Fixed an issue with his drone being able to drop items from Crypto s inventory. Fixed an issue with his drone not being able to fit through certain windows. Fixed an issue with his drone marking friendly Mirage decoys as enemies. Revenant Fixed an issue with Revenant getting pushed into geo when his totem was deployed in tight spaces. Rampart Fixed an issue with Rampart not being able to place an amp wall while jumping. Fixed an issue with Sheila teleporting when placed on a hatch in World s Edge Staging.",

So when the recent a notes mentioned a change to how the cooldown worked, many Pathfinder players thought their luck was in until they saw the reality in practice. The recent change altered Pathfinder grapple cooldown so it would be measured based on distance travelled, with a longer grapple resulting in a longer cooldown. With the measuring the grapple from the moment you leave the ground to when you on the ground again and not sliding at crazy high speeds, this means you now less likely to be punished for accidentally shooting your grapple too early which happens to us all. But should you want to use your grapple to slingshot and slide out of trouble, the seconds can stack up. Just take a look at the evidence below, in which a effectively racks up a second cooldown just for sliding on his bum after a grapple. This is because the cooldown timer only begins when Pathfinder has reached sprint speed, and anything above that speed will not trigger the cooldown. For many players, this feels a little different to the second maximum cooldown for long distances they were expecting from the recent notes, even if that technically still true. a more",
