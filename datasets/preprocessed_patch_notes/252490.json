locking ragdoll corpse rather using spring would stay together unfortunately locking pelvis position coming server whilst simulating connected joint client made physic system unhappy trying unity trick using versus projection solver iteration etc help limb would want stay pelvis pulled around end horrifying ragdoll instead simply wrong place plus limb still old problem issue pelvis always
