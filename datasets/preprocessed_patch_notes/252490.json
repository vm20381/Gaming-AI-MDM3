        "content": "PRIMITIVE GAMEMODE The early of can be the most exciting, unfortunately players rush to fully automatic rifles as fast as possible to get an edge over their enemies. What if the early could last forever? The primitive mode brings us to a distant future where the knowledge of high tech items have been lost, leaving the inhabitants of the island only able to make basic items. The following apply to the primitive mode. Allowed Weapons Melee Bow, Compound Bow, Crossbow, Mini Crossbow Speargun Eoka Beancan Grenade, Molotov Flashlight Attachment Shields Restricted Armor Facemask Metal Chest Plate Resources Less Sulfur Nodes Spawn Increased Tech Tree Tax Loot Jackhammer Chainsaw loot only travelling vendor trades Raiding All Rockets MLRS Building Metal Building Grade Armored Building Grade Armored Doors, Rockets Explosive ammo World Modifications Monuments Oil Rig, Missile Silo, Excavator, Underwater Labs Underground Train System Scientist NPCs vendors remain Disabled Patrol Heli Event Disabled Cargo Ship Event Disabled Bradley APC Increased Wild Horse Spawns Travel Helicopters Minicopter, Scrap Transport Helicopter, Attack Helicopter WEAPONS Introducing vehicles the weapons! Designed for early raiding, they all craftable and deployable in the wilds. A great addition to your raiding and grubbing arsenal. In addition to the cost to craft, building them will require extra materials and a hammer They are both available in the primitive and vanilla modes, from the workbench level. CATAPULT The catapult is capable of launching powerful projectiles with a large impact radius. It comes with ammunition items Scattershot multiple rocks in a spread Firebomb ignites on impact, spreading flames Propane Explosive Bomb explosives, damages construction It can launch players. Use at your own risk. CATAPULT AMMO You can use the Firebomb and Propane bombs as a deployable raiding tool. Once deployed they will start to spark when they take any damage and explode after several seconds. When used in this way bombs will do less damage. TOWER The Tower provides a way to get into compounds, high open windows or help with a raid. As the heaviest Weapon, these towers lack some mobility, but make up for it in strength. the other Weapons The Tower can be towed by a horse, or pushed to get it into position. Each tower is levels tall, with a drawbridge on each level. Use the drawbridge to provide some protection as you assault a base. Each tower can have a door placed at the bottom for an layer of security. BATTERING RAM The battering ram is a heavy vehicle you can drive around. Its reinforced arm can be used to destroy wooden and stone constructions The ram takes damage with each hit and will need metal to stay operational. BALLISTA The ballista is a massive, wheeled crossbow designed for combat. It can be deployed on terrain and towed by horses. It can fire bolt items Pitchfork Bolt large sweeping projectile Piercer Bolt penetrates armored vehicles Hammerhead Bolt heavy and solid, deals damage to doors Incendiary Bolt ignites on impact, spreading flames A stationary version is available, which can be deployed within your base for defensive use. SHIELDS Shields are a backpack slot item that allows you handle frontal threats with ease. Simply equip the shield in your backpack slot and equip a compatible single handed weapon and the shield will automatically appear. While holding a shield it takes over the function of RMB, so you won t be able to aim down sights or throw weapons. Instead holding RMB will raise the shield in front of you, giving you more protection at the cost of reduced visibility and not being able to sprint. You can only hold a Shield up for seconds before having to put it back down, this is shown via a small progress bar near the crosshair similar to the Compound Bow. There are shield variants, each with a different damage block amount. This amount is the percentage of damage that the shield absorbs from any incoming attack, the remaining portion will be received by the holding the shield. While equipped you ll see a shield durability bar appear above your health bar, any damage a shield takes is applied to its durability and once broken the shield will be unequipped. Items that are compatible with shields will mention this on their item information panel when selected. When not in use Shields will appear on your back, note that while they are on your back they provide no protection. You will need to equip the shield in order to block any attacks. SHOT MINI CROSSBOW In the spirit of a primitive mode, we wanted to add another arrow weapon. The Mini Crossbow is a fresh take on the Crossbow. Providing shots in a rotating barrel, at the cost of some damage and range. The Mini Crossbow will not only be a great addition to the base, but the primitive gamemode. HORSES Horses have been completely overhauled and should feel much better to with. They can now traverse most terrain types and monuments movement mechanics allow them to skid by pressing CTRL when galloping They can swim, trees and be pulled when led Horses can tow weapons, including the catapult, tower, and ballista. Additionally, their impact on server performance has been massively improved. MEDIEVAL PACK DLC This month, we re introducing the Medieval Pack DLC a themed collection featuring items and skins consisting of the Medieval Barricade, Knights Armour clothing skins, Medieval Large Wood Box skin, the Medieval Assault Rifle skin and Medieval skins for the Sheet Metal Door and Double Doors. The pack can be purchased from the item. Knight Armour Set Arise a brave Knight with these chivalric skins for the Coffeecan Helmet, Roadsign Jacket and Roadsign Kilt. Medieval Barricade Lay down this barricade to stave off the most ardent attackers, or augment the battlefield with its unique visuals. Note that you will need to know the Barbed Wooden Barricade blueprint to craft this. Medieval Assault Rifle Kingmaker or Kingslayer you call the shots with this resplendent relic. Medieval Large Wooden Box Every Lord needs a sturdy coffer to their spoils of war. Look no further than this stalwart companion. Medieval Sheet Metal Door Double Door Survey your lands from behind these imposing castle doors, uniquely adorned with spikes to keep the nakeds out. The pack can be purchased from the item. RAGDOLLS Temporary ragdolling has been for bikes and horses. Taking large amounts of collision damage on bikes and horses will result in the being flung from their seat and eventually getting back up assuming they have died in the process. Players can be flung from the saddle of a horse if it had too much airtime or has slid too far. Horses will ragdoll in these cases as well. If you unlucky enough to be used as ammunition for a catapult, you ragdoll and are guaranteed to die on impact. Collision damage on bikes has been with ragdolls in mind, with the aim of making it less likely to instantly die from hitting obstacles on a bike. FIRST PERSON ADMIN ESP We been slowly building up the feature set of our admin ESP system over the years, mostly due to the demands of various streaming events. This was restricted to using the camera, it will now work as expected while in first person perspective spectating. Many server admins have asked for this to have better situational awareness while spectating players. It uses the same convars as the normal ESP system so you should need to do anything. All of the existing convars will apply, this includes If there are further improvements that would help in live spectating, please let us know! QUALITY OF LIFE Pickup sleeping bags Players can now pick up any sleeping bag as long they are in TC range IO Reskinning Can now reskin IO deployables with the spray can without disconnecting it entirely Phone names Phones can now have names up to characters long Pumpkin Rolling Dropped pumpkins no longer roll indefinitely Backpacks on Weapon Racks Backpacks and shields can now be used with weapon racks. SOCIAL INTEGRATIONS We rolling out a social integration layer to this month, no more messing around with overlays or you can now view, chat, invite, and add friends, all from right inside the. Your friends list will automatically sync up. No setup required. Prefer using Discord? No problem! All you need to do is link your account, and your Discord friends will be right there, ready to connect. This way, you ve got the best of both worlds.

And from more of our favourite creators on the rise that you should definitely start to recognize! Be sure to sync up at to claim your Drops after watching these fantastic creators on Twitch. SERVER PROFILER LINUX REDUCED OVERHEAD TL DR Shipping Linux binary Server profiler should have less impact when idle and recording by gathering less data if it fails to generate a snapshot, you can now export a debug binary snapshot and share it with us. Linux Support This will contain a library built for Linux environment. The library is a native recorder, so the interface the perfsnapshot command works the same. The library has been built on Ubuntu via GCC in mode and it depends on POSIX utilities dlopen, dlsym so it should be accessible everywhere. Profiler Overhead Since the first release of our internal profiler, we got the opportunity to test it in the real world conditions. My first tests were rough could only capture frames worth of data before ballooning to multiple gigabytes of data and I got feedback from number of server owners that not only it does produce snapshots in some situations, it has idle overhead just enabling profiler can have a on a server. I spent some time this cycle to to reduce this overhead, as in the current conditions it severely reduces the benefit we can get out of the tool. I tackled it from a couple angles Reduced how much Code we capture The profiler works by annotating every code method that it encounters, wrapping it in a set of calls that dispatch to different Mono profilers. Comparatively, for complex and expensive methods these call are unnoticeable, but for small utility functions that do a trivial thing change a bool, set a bit, append to a list, etc the dispatching calls add massive overhead we talking the cost of the utility function. Lastly, these dispatching calls are cheaper when the profiler is enabled, but not capturing but they are still not free. Originally I set up a number of annotation filters to exclude some known and safe code stuff from namespace, for example, but it still left a lot of fat that we could trim. Here the before and after of the affecting our processing loop As you can see there much less of nested calls reduced verticality, and instant calls triangles, they take less than Perfetto is able to track appear much earlier. This we no longer capture Hash functions Casting comparison operators Property getters related code Enumerators Anything Math related Our internal collections BufferList Serialization code There more, but hopefully you see the principle behind the choice anything small, trivial or reliable gets ignored. This allowed us to massively reduce the amount of data we generate during capture on staging server, we used to generate about of json per, after these it gone down to of json per. This should reduce the idle overhead, since there much less dispatch code that scattered around. Improved json generation logic of the quirks that we have to deal with data is that it does know where the frame begins and ends it just a stream of method records frame end record that happens somewhere deep in the managed callstack. And since we want to display the data in a organized matter, we need to scan this stream to figure out how to partition all records. Originally I implemented a version of this because I assumed that there would be too much data to overwhlem this process. Since the previous section showed that I was wrong on the scale of data, I spent a bit of time to improve the export process we now only need scans to figure out frame grouping, instead of originally, so using, this gives us export speedup. Additionally, I received reports that profiler can fail to generate snapshots. There are a couple scenarios in the above logic that can cause it to fail, so for these cases I the option to dump a binary debug snapshot just run perfsnapshot, and you should see a in folder. I be able to inspect it in our internal tool to see what am I missing Future Plans I been using this tool on the daily to inspect the state of our Staging servers, and I hoping to do the same with our medium and release servers as well. To squeeze out the most, there are additional improvements that I to pursue when the time allows Continue trimming down on annotated functions there still plenty to reduce. Need to expose the annotation filter to server owners right now it all hardcoded which is limiting Need to expand allocation tracking right now we just track how much we allocated on main thread. We could track allocated object types, and figure out a better way to display it on Perfetto. Emit more metadata about the performance state provide manual annotation tools to emit the scope of workload for our, or to show dependencies. Explore automatic capture during frame spikes.

We getting back to work after a couple of weeks off, which is why this blog is lighter than usual, but we looking forward to the journey ahead in!

Thank you for your continued support, be it playing the, telling friends, and engaging and communicating with us. We very much enjoyed everything we worked on for the this year. LOOKING FORWARD What s in for? Consistency! Continued guaranteed monthly updates on the first Thursday of every month, alongside regular fixes, enhancements, improvements, and exciting holiday events. Next Month On February, we release the Primitive. The will be of the most impactful updates to date in changing the dynamics of raiding and combat by introducing vehicles, primitive weapons, shields, and a dedicated mode. The Primitive represents a time in where the already scarce technology and the usual homemade armaments and ammunition have been depleted from current setting, forcing survivors to fashion crude weapons with less sophisticated methods of attack and defence. The Tower can be used to climb over exterior walls while players remain in cover. And it can be pushed or and has several floors, with extendable drawbridges that double up as shutters. The Catapult will be a projectile launcher for longer distances that can utilise multiple projectiles such as boulders, radioactive barrels, and propane tank IEDs. While it does have wheels, its size makes it something that a vehicle or horse will have to help you move it towards your next target. The Ballista is a combination of a catapult and a large crossbow which was highly accurate given the heft of its projectiles. And in, those features remain with the Ballista having multiple ammo types, being able to do heavy damage to people, doors, and vehicles. Finally, the Battering Ram will be another addition that is driveable a traditional vehicle, with a triggerable ram that damages building blocks in a radius. As well as these weapons and vehicles, we have been working on a variety of shields, a shot, and updates to melee damages and ranges. With this comes some improvements to horses, including their ability to tow the weapons, and skins to customise your primitive approach to gameplay and expression. Ca wait till February? Staging branch is publicly playable, allowing everyone to test and give feedback. Forwards Alongside next month Primitive, we have a ton of content currently in development, and if you keeping an eye on our commits page, you already know some of what on the way. This year, you can expect to see Cooking bringing many to food management and unique buffs to foods, a Jungle biome featuring dangerous animals such as crocodiles and tigers, and to softcore and hardcore modes. Outlined above is skimming the surface of only a few key features. We have a lot more planned. But what about? Performance? Performance is always an ongoing process. We constantly adding and improving features monthly, often hidden in changelogs. There is no magic button to increase performance. Instead, it is a slow process of small gains. We hired several people over the past couple of months whose sole job is focused on tasks, these are positions which never existed before, we never had staff dedicated to performance, they getting to grips with the project and are already hard at work identifying and fixing issues. A recent example is Daniel server profiler. We continue to share news on performance in our monthly development blogs. Old Content? As with prior years we set aside multiple months in our internal roadmap of light or no content. These gaps are deliberate to allow us to be versatile and adaptive to community feedback, have time to focus and address old content and improve recent content. We have a lot we can keep building upon, not all content we add to is supposed to become meta, but rather adding yet another way of achieving a goal. Cheating? Repeating the words of last year blog Anticheat is a hugely complex topic. We work closely with Epic Easy, to aid in detecting and banning cheaters in. We do disclose what we do and do do when it comes to for good reason. The more information we disclose publicly, the more it can assist cheaters and cheat developers to circumvent measures, it a huge. of the best measures is obscurity. The fewer people know what EAC and we are doing, the better. This comes with the drawback of not communicating enough, on the outside, it appears we doing nothing. Almost every month, we shipping improvements or cheat features. We fixed several exploits upon discovery or disclosure within hours through hotfixes we do note publicly. EAC sometimes pushes several improvements weekly, which are applied when you start the. We continue to promise to you is we actively monitoring and combating cheaters daily. Our internal systems keep improving, as do EAC. In past blogs I talked about culling, if a is behind a hill and you ca see them, do network the to disrupt ESP cheat features. We slowly iterating this and have tested it on live servers, we working on getting this to the most performant state possible to work on population servers. Another feature we exploring and want your feedback on it, is a form of premium servers. The overwhelming number of cheaters banned have inventory valued at below. A large number of regular players have inventories of over. If we used this as a gate to entry for some servers, it would mean these servers would see considerably fewer players, is this something you want? Would you on these servers? We still collecting data to determine the exact barrier to entry. The reason for looking at Inventory price, in short, is because it a metric that ca be spoofed and gamed easily, unlike data. The big negative here is servers rely on a steady flow of players, and old this gate could have a net negative impact on the server population and, thus, the overall gameplay experience we love to hear your thoughts. This year We taken down over media on social platforms. bans applied Temporary Permanent The majority of cheaters have been from the in less than hours of playtime This has lowered this to hours of playtime in the last Cheat reports received cheating reports received on Facepunch servers YEARS OF IN NUMBERS While we celebrated a fantastic for the, we realise a lot of what we achieved boils down to years of passion from the. And passion from the community. It not always easy to put that into words, but we managed to put it into numbers below. Take a look at what you helped us achieve over the last years!

Here are just some of the key gameplay additions we delivered as we look back on World Backpacks Tutorial Island Digital Clock Night Light Harbour Monument Rework Cargo Ship Docking Minigun Flamethrower Seismic Sensor Handcuffs Prisoner Hood Motorbikes Pedal Bikes Travelling Vendor Tin Can Alarm Metal Detector Wallpaper GCO Attachement Diver Propulsion Vehicle Refreshed Divesites Radtown Radioactive Water SMG SKS and much more! To celebrate turning, next week, you find a cake and balloons. And your friends can enjoy off for days, starting on Monday! On behalf of everyone at Facepunch, we to thank you for a great. In January, we release a full blog in which we discuss how has gone, with highlights, learnings, and our plans for. QUALITY OF LIFE Peacekeeper Turret Hostile Indicator A turret icon now appears next to the usual hostile indicator when you are hostile and near a peace keeper auto turret. Workcart Storage A small box has been to all Workcarts so you can that extra loot. Waterpump Depth Change Waterpumps now work with a smaller depth of water, perfect for the rivers. Propane Tank Stack Size Propane tanks can now stack up to. Dropbox Input Increase Increased to input slots. Junkpile Despawn Junkpiles will now be eligible to despawn after they are partially looted. Fridge Storage Fridge storage increased to slots Homing Missiles Homing missiles have been to Bradley and attack helicopter loot crates WOLF PACKS BALANCING We spent this month bug fixing and improving the to the wolves, as we want them to feel challenging but not unfair. The problems Using fire against wolf sometimes felt less impactful than expected, especially when wanting to avoid the fight. Even though wolves would attack as long as you kept distance and a lit torch, they would follow for a very long time. This was especially aggravating when driving wolves away from your corpse to get back your loot, but then having them still follow you and potentially cause a death spiral. Furthermore, when jumping on an elevated position to escape the wolf, it would ignore the lit torch and rush to jump up. The wolf could do very fast huge jumps sometimes up to your base roof. The jump motion looked weightless and not believable. Another problem was packs of wolves. They did appear all the time, but players that had to face them had a hard time. Even though packs never spawn with more than wolves, they could sometimes merge. That because wolves always come to investigate when their hear a howl, even if it comes from a wolf that does not belong to their pack. Once the shot a wolf or they got close enough, wolves would give up stalking and weave at high speed towards their prey. For players that only had a bow, this made it hard to land more than or shot as the pack of wolves closed the gap. And once enough wolves were in melee range, while it was possible to prevent a single of them from attacking thanks to hit stun, you easily got overwhelmed. Lastly it felt harder than it should have been to crouch and sneak around wolf packs, forcing players to take very long detours if they did want to fight. Closing words You can find more details about how we addressed those issues in the notes at the bottom of the page. Congrats to the players who found some of the hidden features that could be used to get the upper hand on wolves! ELECTRICITY QOL Tesla Coil Reduced tesla coil maximum power usage from to no difference in time to kill Storage Monitor a passthrough slot to the Storage Monitor Elevators speed Increased speed of placed elevators by Battery full charge indicator an output slot for when your battery is fully charged MODULAR CAR RADIOS Modular car radios are now in! This means that you can now craft a radio to place in your modular car for metal fragments if you own the Voice Props Pack. Simply craft the radio and then deploy it onto the cockpit of your modular vehicle. The radio will only be operational whilst the car engine is switched on. Once the radio is deployed, anyone will be able to interact with it. Anyone with authorisation to the vehicle will be able to pick up the radio with a building hammer. The radio comes with all the same and internet streamed radio stations you find in the Boom Box HELICOPTER SHREDDING Purchased Helicopters can now be picked up by the magnet crane and shredded at Junkyard. You will receive Scrap based on the helicopter type and it current health health of the Scrap. Minicopter Scrap Scrap Transport Helicopter Scrap Attack Helicopter Scrap Stolen a helicopter from your neighbours? Why not destroy the evidence and get paid at the same time! UPGRADABLE HIGH EXTERNAL WALLS GATES Wooden high external walls and gates can now be upgraded to their stone versions via the hammer context manner, similar to regular building blocks. Additionally, high external walls now craft in batches of three. The stone high external walls requiring sheet metal per craft. The stone high external gate has been adjusted to require sheet metal and only gears, with its crafting cost reduced to down from for improved inventory management. VENDING MACHINE STATISTICS You are now able to see a bunch of statistics about your vending machine. This includes Transaction History Highest Revenue Items Best Sold Items You can browse these stats in a wide variety of timescales from the last minutes to. Some term stats are available all anonymous, these are Total Sales The total number of items purchased from the vending machine Total Unique Customers The total number of individual customers who have made a purchase Total Repeat Customers The total number of instances where existing customers have returned to make additional purchases. Best Customer The customer who has made the most purchases total count of their transactions These stats are processed on the Serverside then communicated to clients. Here are a few Server Convars to help server owners Specifies the maximum number of entries to return when fetching purchase history or aggregated stats, items, most items, etc Limits the maximum number of sales records to process when performing operations filtering or aggregating data, even if more records are available Defines the maximum number of purchase records that the vending machine will in memory on Serverside before removing older entries to make space for ones Server owners can run and to clear all Vending Machine stats and long term stats respectively. LEGACY SHELTER REVOKE Once you placed your Legacy Shelter, it was possible to die and then be unable to place another. When placing down another shelter, your first is now destroyed. There trade off Shelters now take a few seconds to place just high external walls. This gives enough time to warn you that your old Shelter is going to be destroyed, as well as preventing them from being used in PVP. VARIABLE ZOOM SCOPE The scope was significantly considering it intended to be military loot. This seemed to come down to it being too high of a zoom. This scope has now been renamed to the variable zoom scope and supports zoom levels,. This makes it better than both of the old scopes combined adds in a zoom for quick target acquisition. The default keybinds are Up to increase zoom and Down to decrease zoom, however I fully expect more experienced players to rebind these. Try scroll wheel if you are using it to switch weapons or mouse mouse if those are already bound. SCRAP EXCHANGE VENDOR Now that we reached a point where we are happy with the dynamic pricing behaviour when purchasing items with Scrap, we decided to apply the same logic to items being sold for Scrap. Starting this month, you will notice that items that you sell to NPC vending machines for Scrap have a dynamic price applied to them. It will start the wipe with less value per item sold, and can increase to an extra value per item sold if no items are sold. This will hopefully make it more valuable to sell items as a wipe goes on. As with the previous, we be monitoring these and making as needed. UNDERWATER VISIBILITY We recently tweaked this, but your feedback made it clear there was further room for improvement. So we did just that. Underwater visibility is now nearly doubled, allowing players to see further and more clearly underwater. Additionally, we slightly increased the depth of water players can sink to before the oxygen level starts to tick down. During swimming, you are now less likely to drown to high waves. RISKY LANDMINE DISARMING Landmines now have a chance to explode when being disarmed by another, so be careful when clearing out minefields! This was always meant to be the intended gameplay behaviour for landmines, but I discovered an old bug that prevented this from working as intended. NODE SPARKLE We slightly modified the behaviour when hitting nodes this month. Nodes will no longer show a sparkle before they are hit for the first time, once they are hit the sparkle will appear underneath the first hit. This first hit is considered a sparkle hit and will reward the appropriate amount of resources, so it a very slight buff to ore collecting. We did this for a few reasons This brings their behaviour in line with the tree marker minigame Finding the sparkle at first was slightly awkward, this feels smoother Each sparkle was a networked entity that had to be streamed in and out as the moves around We had a sparkle per node in the world, so an average server will now have around less entities in the world While I was at it I made some slight memory improvements so each node will take up less client and server memory. QUEUE IMPROVEMENTS While looking at collecting some data around queues, we decided to do a few minor improvements to the queue system. Up until now, the client was unaware of being in a queue, it was simply using server messaging to show the queue. Now the client knows when it has entered and exited a server queue, and can act accordingly. We now display rich presence for waiting in a queue and connecting to a server. This opens us up to do more client side related queue features in the future. The other change to queues we made impacts modded server owners specifically. The queue messaging system was being leverage by modded servers to implement loading screen messages via a plugin. These loading screen messages would often fight with the client messaging, and generally did look great. As a nice compromise, we implemented the ability to change the menu tip message displayed in the loading screen. This can allow modded server owners to implement their own tips that may be more relevant for the particular mode and specific to the server. To keep things backwards compatible, the same network message sent before will continue to work with caveat. Old var net Top Text Bottom Text SendInfo conn var net Bolt This server has instant craft! SendInfo conn Instead of having top and bottom text, you can change the menu tip icon displayed. Existing loading screen plugins will continue to function, but wo display a top message as that field is now used for an icon. A list of available icons names has been published on our Community GitHub repository. Only servers clearly listed in the modded section may utilize this feature. RCON SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS Another for all the server owners out there. We started updating the security around RCON. The server will output very prominent warning messages if you using an insecure RCON password. In some cases, the RCON server will fail to start if the password is bad enough. password or changeme We some safeguards against brute attacks. Now when a RCON client attempts to connect with a bad password, after attempts the IP address will be banned for minutes. These values are all configurable through a number of convars. There are a few convar commands that allow you to permanently ban both IP addresses and networks. default Number of seconds to apply to any automated ban. default Number of failed password attempts before applying a temp ban default true all the various failed password ban connects. Defaults to true, but large servers may want to disable due to spam default false Permanently ban IPs that exceed the failed password threshold Permanently bans an IP or network Removes an IP or network ban from both the permanent bans, and any temporary Prints out the table of attempted logins that failed and if they resulted in a ban or not Removes all of the temporary failed login does not remove permanent bans of any kind List the permanent bans NATIVE HARDWARE SUPPORT We been waiting for a while for all of our third party software to natively support hardware. This has now finally come to fruition and as the first platform to test this on, we switched the Mac version of the to use our native build on Apple Silicon hardware. At the moment, Intel hardware is still supported on Mac as well and remains unaffected by this change. If this works out well, we will investigate native support for other platforms in the future. The next most important would likely be to natively run on hardware in Windows laptops, but we are still waiting for some third party software to fully support this, so this will stretch a good amount into the next year at least. SERVER PROFILER Up to recently we been focusing on server performance health via tracking aggregating performance telemetry. It allowed us to have a general overview of a server performance from birds eye view. There are point where overview is not sufficient to identify where exactly are coming from. This past month I been working on a profiler for the server. If used, it allows us to see all the code that is executed for a particular frame allowing us to see more detail about what how things are going wrong. With this, we can now combine our telemetry as an system, while using the profiler will allow us to investigate what those hotspot consist of and which parts are the most worthwhile to optimize. This will help guide our efforts in optimizing the server performance while validating that we have successfully optimized a particular block of logic. The profiler comes with an extra benefit this feature is going to be available for public use. Any server owner will be able to trigger it and take a look at the data. You be able to see both what vanilla server does, as well as if there anything that Mods are actively doing. How to Generate a snapshot Note This is currently only available for servers hosted on Windows machines. Linux support is next to come. First, the feature needs to be activated when starting the server. You must launch the server executable with Once the server boots up, you can run the following console command all parameters are optional delay is in seconds, by default set to name is the name of the snapshot file, by default is Profile frames is the number of frames to includes in the snapshot default is, has a max of Once the delay expires you see messages in chat, it will record the requested number of frames, generate and compress a snapshot you will find it in Note if something goes wrong during generation the file wo be created youl l can it in server log file. I be continuing iterating on the profiler, so I iron out any. Note Taking a snapshot causes server to take a performance hit for a couple seconds. Make sure to give enough delay to avoid disturbing the server population too much. When not taking a snapshot, the impact is. Exploring The Snapshot You can extract the compressed snapshot using any utility that understands GZip explorer,. The snapshot uses Google Event Format, so you can use any tool to view it. For example, I been Perfetto UI to visualize the data just drag and drop the json into the view and you can start exploring. TWITCH IS BACK! That right, Twitch V is almost here! Starting Monday of December and finishing Friday, up to Twitch creators from around the world will compete in our yearly PvP competitive event, with a prize pool of! Last year event saw some incredible plays from some rather understated competitors so be sure to tune in every day at GMT EST to watch as tensions rise and the teams find their feet while they gather their resources, build to protect themselves, then raid, loot, and fight it out to be crowned victorious! This year Captains include IV winning captain, Blooprint, as well as Oilrats, NoraExplorer, Willjum, and more! Full schedule and teams list from Twitch here.

        "content": "HANDMADE SMG This month we adding weapons, firstly filling a gap in the weapon lineup, the Handmade SMG is unlockable near the end of the tech tree. While it lacks accuracy and raw damage, it compensates for this with sheer volume, letting players unleash a hail of bullets. Skilled survivors can use it to stay competitive by timing their attacks and positioning themselves carefully, allowing for surprise bursts against foes. SKS Unlockable at the start of the tech tree, the SKS bridges the gap between the SAR and the. This powerhouse combines punchy damage with accuracy, making it a reliable pick for players who want a rifle with solid range and stopping power. The SKS delivers balanced performance with a kick that seasoned survivors will appreciate. IMPROVED WOLF AI Hello I Maverick! I recently joined Facepunch to work on the AI and it been a blast so far. This month we releasing the first step of a major AI overhaul. We starting small by just updating the wolf, but the goal is to scientists and all other animals. The why The current wolf feels a bit a landmine if you walking around and you did see it or hear its footsteps, you die. That issue is of course amplified in the pitch black night. Since wolves runs faster than players, once spotted your only options are to try to kill it before it kills you, or jump out of reach if possible. Since the wolf charges in a straight line, you do have to aim and if you have a nailgun or better it just a matter of unloading the magazine as fast as you can. Assuming you spotted the wolf before it spotted you, hunting it was not engaging. When shot from a distance wolves do charge and just flee very far away, often forcing you to engage in a long hike to get its loot. The result of this is that the wolf was either frustratingly hard to handle, or trivial, with no in between. This motivated us to reshape the wolf into something that would pose a challenge that feels fair, and can be tackled in multiple ways. The how I could write an exhaustive list of all the behaviors, but I think it be way more fun for you to experiment and I confident the community will find even the cool hidden ones. Forget everything you know about the old wolves and just try out stuff that seems it should work! QUALITY OF LIFE IO Arrows arrows that show when looking at IO deployables Floating objects drift down rivers Corpses, Boogie Boards, Boats now float down rivers Hear voices over CCTV Listen in on the group taking Oil Rig Disable Monument CCTV Can now damage monument CCTV cameras to disable them for minutes Copy Paste IDs in menu Easily get a ID when using the Report menu Add vendor NPC to all Water Wells Every Water Well variant now has killable vendor GESTURE PACK DLC This month we more ways for players to communicate and express themselves with the introduction of our first gesture pack available now on permanent item. The pack includes gestures Rock Paper Scissors Loser L Hand Knuckle Crack Wagging Finger Cut Throat Shush Watching You Finger Gun NOTE You need to assign the gestures to a slot on the gesture wheel via our gesture wheel customisation on the main menu under Options Gestures learn more below Rock Paper Scissors Included in the pack is our first ever gesture minigame Rock Paper Scissors. Trying to decide which teammate does the next farming run? Or who gets to use the? Now you can settle the score with a round of Rock Paper Scissors. To, select Rock Paper Scissors from the gesture wheel then wait for an opponent to interact with you to start the minigame. Note you need to assign the gesture to a slot via the main menu for it to appear on the gesture wheel Once a joins, you be prompted with UI to choose a to use the numerical keys on your keyboard to make a selection of either rock, paper or scissors. Both you and your opponent will have seconds to make a choice If the timer runs out or a moves too far away, the will end. After selections are made by both parties, each will shoot simultaneously on the count of three to determine a win, lose or draw result. We look forward to seeing how you all use the minigame our plan is to add similar interactive gestures in the near future. GESTURE WHEEL CUSTOMISATION In order to support the gesture pack we ve the ability to customise your gesture wheel this month, as well as adding a wheel so you can access double the gestures. You ll find this in the Options Gestures menu. Customising your wheel is straightforward from this menu. Simply click on a slot to change what gesture is assigned, or use RMB to clear a slot. You can access the second wheel via the arrows at the top, and use to switch between gesture wheels. We re just exposing wheels as even with the gestures you won t be able to fill them up, but we ve now got the system built so we can add more wheels as we release more gestures down the line. RADIOACTIVE WATER BUFF The introduction of Radioactive Water last month was pretty weak. We felt it needed a buff to bring it in line with the original vision. Here are the to Radioactive Water We have increased the radiation amount from sprinklers by We have increased the radiation amount from splashes by This makes Radioactive Water the against full kits that it should be. MIXING TABLE IMPROVEMENTS This month I some nice QOL improvements for the mixing table. You can now click a recipe to add the required ingredients to the mixing table inventory, in the correct slots. Repeat clicking will stack the additional ingredients required to produce another of the same item. will add the ingredients for the maximum number of items you can afford to produce. The recipe names of recipes you can not afford to produce are now greyed out, making it much quicker to see what you can currently create. Finally, I made some minor performance and memory improvements for the mixing table UI. ANTICHEAT Since our last back in July, we have applied an additional bans, of these were temporary, and the remaining were permanent bans. Here the breakdown per World October permanent bans temporary bans reports Time To Kill September permanent bans temporary bans reports Stay Alert August permanent bans temporary bans reports Road Renegades July permanent bans temporary bans reports Notes report data is only from Facepunch Official servers due to data reliability originating from servers, the total number of reports across all server since July is million. Bans that were later reverted are excluded from these metrics. Bans are placed for multiple reasons. The numbers above do not strictly reflect only bans, but bans make up the vast majority of bans. A single can receive multiple bans, for example, if a user is temporarily banned and then later switched to a permanent ban, this is counted as bans in the above metrics. The above is to provide context and transparency, not to state we doing a good job, there is much more to be done in this area, and we are continuing to work on it. Next In July, I talked about culling, if a is behind a hill and you ca see them, do network the. We feel we done all we can in internal testing and will now roll out this change slowly across all official servers starting this month. We teamed up with a third party to handle takedowns on our behalf. of the core objectives is aimed at material. The takedowns will be made at the request of Facepunch staff after manual review. There is no automation, and there is no room for innocent content to be taken down. We taken down over media on social platforms. We working continuing to work on several other legal fronts to disrupt cheaters. COPY PASTE Copy Paste is a admin tool that allows server admins to copy, paste save bases! This opens up a number of workflows such as allowing admins to submit a copy of a base when they are submitting a bug report. It will speed up testing on staging, allowing you to paste platforms with every item you need to test content. If you are interested, head over to the wiki page to learn how to use it!

FACEPUNCH SERVERS Many official Facepunch servers, especially those in Eastern and Western Europe and Eastern US, have been upgraded to, hardware. This upgrade should significantly improve stability in these regions during peak time. Some servers received a slight increase in their max capacities. Following this, you may find that your favourite Facepunch server is no longer on your favourites list. To find it, please use the search bar and, if needed, enable the show empty servers option. Upgrades for other regions will be rolled out in the coming weeks. All blueprints have been transferred, so no progress has been lost.",

        "content": "RADTOWN of the emblematic locations from legacy makes a comeback Radtown. We turned this monument from a bunch of blocky garage buildings, into a refreshed gameplay space. We tried to preserve the proportions and purpose of each location while opening up paths and adding way to improve the flow of movement and cover throughout. Exteriors Interiors CLIFFS We have completely reworked all cliffs in the. The cliffs come in types, tall coastal cliffs placed close to the ocean and sloped inland cliffs covering hills and mountains. A lot of effort was made into making them not only look realistic, but easy to traverse. You can run up the inland cliffs with ease, while the coastal cliffs can be scaled by jumping on the rocky ledges and protrusions. In addition we have many coastal rocks close to the shore to further spice up the world. REVAMPED ROCK FORMATIONS We have completely revamped all large rock formations in the and decided to bring back some of the old fan favorites. Formations such as the god rock, anvil rock and arch rock all return to the. Completely rock formations have been and some of them even spawn off shore allowing for more base building possibilities than ever before. UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTS In, you will now find several different canyons, lakes, and oasis of various sizes in each procedurally generated map. Canyons, Lakes, and Oases each offering a fresh way to with their own pros and cons. Canyons provide narrow pathways for ambushes but can be risky to navigate. Lakes create opportunities for resource gathering and farming but leave you vulnerable in open water. Oases are lush safe havens with valuable resources but will become hotspots for fierce competition. Canyons These towering landscapes offer fresh opportunities for ambushes and base building. While the narrow pathways and steep drops make for thrilling combat and strategic locations. Canyons can be rich in resources, but do get too greedy and get caught out. Lakes These scenic water bodies add a twist to the gameplay, offering great spots for fishing, resource gathering, farming and by the shore. However, the open water leaves you exposed to attacks, and swimming can slow you down when trying to make a quick escape. Oasis These rare paradises amidst the harsh desert. These lush areas are perfect for setting up base, gathering, farming, and finding vital resources water. But be warned Oases will attract other players looking to take advantage of these havens. RIVERS Rivers are now longer, flow more naturally, and widen the longer they get. This as well as the unique environments required a larger water system overhaul to support different water types at any altitude. The ocean is now fully culled underneath the terrain, and lakes no longer stretch beyond their boundaries. Overall, it a much more robust and future proof system. HIGH CALIBER REVOLVER The High Caliber Revolver is a, revolver that uses ammo. Built for precise, shots rather than rapid fire, it demands a steady hand for maximum accuracy. Its slower fire rate reflects the design, but the power and precision make each shot count. Unlockable at a Tier workbench, the High Caliber is for survivors who prioritize accuracy and impact over speed. LEGACY WOOD PILE Welcome back wood piles! These will spawn in the snow, and temperate biomes. They function just our traditional ore piles, but for wood! Harvestable with a rock, hatchet or chainsaw. A great source of wood early in the to start off your journey. DIVE SITES Ocean Wreck Buoys We ve remodelled the old floating bottle indicators on the surface of dive sites into more solid buoys. They are much more visible which will help with finding dive sites. Dive Sites The Dive Sites themselves have been refreshed this month, with an entirely set of three possible options replacing the old sites. All sites now spawn the same amount of loot crates. Each site has unique environment art and topology. Flora and Fauna Alongside the Buoys and Dive Sites, we overhauled the underwater foliage with a graphical, and tweaked the visuals on fish so they behave more naturally. You might even find a couple of other critters down there. DIVER PROPULSION VEHICLE DPV We small handheld dive vehicle this month. The DPV can be crafted and kept in your inventory until you need it. It then used so Select it and deploy it into any water that at least metre deep Interact with the fuel tank and add some low grade fuel Mount it to hold onto the handles and drive it around Using the DPV, you can travel underwater significantly faster than you could by swimming. Once you done with it, simply dismount and pick it up. Fuel will automatically be and to your inventory, or dropped if you do have any space. Note Currently players will need to manually remove fuel before picking up the DPV. This will be corrected in a hotfix asap WATER WELL Waterwells aren t exactly the most popular monument in, so this month we decided to make them a little more interesting. You will now find a vendor at some NPC s that can offer a random selection of teas and farming equipment that shuffles every minutes. What s special about this NPC is that this is the first vendor that is available in non safe zones. This means they can be killed! If that happens they will respawn after a while, but that won t trigger the vendor to refresh or have any loot so there s no real purpose. Try and be nice! You will find a food cache with basic teas and high quality food items, and some planters that are automatically filled with random plants periodically. These plants have a high priority of having good genes, so they re a great way to give your farm base a quick boost. RADIOACTIVE WATER We a gameplay feature to the world Radioactive Water! This is available at locations in the Radtown monument. Players will be able to harvest it with any regular water container, be it a bota bag, water jug or the tanker module for vehicles. Radioactive Water has a few properties splashing it on plants will instantly kill them, splashing it on players via throwing your water from a container, or via a sprinkler will irradiate them. Carrying a large amount of it in your inventory will damage you, and finally looting a players body will irradiate you if there enough radioactive water in their inventory. These properties make Radioactive Water a great choice for a number of things from instantly resetting your farm, to being a great to those players raiding you in full gear. The backend work done on Radioactive Water opens up a number of gameplay possibilities in the future as any item in code can now be marked as Radioactive. We ca wait to see what creations you come up with! FRONTIERSMAN PACK This month we introducing a addition to permanent, the Frontiersman Pack. The pack includes three items Frontier Hazmat Suit, Frontier Hatchet, Blunderbuss Frontiersman hazmat suit The Frontiersman Hazmat is a handcrafted survival suit, built for those who brave the wilderness. Forged from durable felt and leather, it s designed to shield its wearer from the harsh weather, unseen enemies, and the dangers of the wild. The Frontiersman suit is a hazmat replacement skin that can be applied while crafting the hazmat or skinned using the repair table. The Frontiersman suit offers no bonuses. Blunderbuss The Blunderbuss is a handcrafted, shotgun that brings a classic, rugged aesthetic to the Double Barrel. This skin reimagines the weapon, turning it into a more traditional tool of survival from a bygone era Frontier Hatchet Inspired by the traditional tomahawk, featuring a rugged design with several charms attached. This unique skin transforms the hatchet into a symbol of frontier survival. Available now on the item.

When powered, it displays the current server time Consumes power Available at the Tier Workbench Craftable for Metal Fragments The clock allows you to set up alarms. When an alarm goes off, the power will pass through, allowing you to trigger any sort of circuit inside your base at specific times. Whether you want to automate your farms, activate traps, or control lighting systems, you can set up to five alarms simultaneously. GCO WEAPON ATTACHMENT A powerful experimental weapon attachment for those who crave more damage and speed in their shots. The Gas Compression Overdrive attachment boosts projectile damage and velocity, allowing you to hit harder. However, this extra power comes with, a slower fire rate and increased recoil. If you can handle the extra kick, this attachment is maybe for you. The GCO attachment works on the following weapons Thompson, SAR, SAP,, and the Custom SMG. WALLPAPERS This month, we adding wallpapers, a way to decorate your base interior. Wallpapers can only be applied to the interior side of your walls. Purely visual, they do provide any additional protection, are easy to remove and wo interfere with the deployment of any other items.

Skins included in the wallpaper starter pack, as pictured above Clouds Yellow Stripe Blue Diamond Fleur variants Retro variants Subway variants Geometric variants Polka Dots variants Wainscotting variants Venetian Plaster variants The Wallpaper Starter Pack is available for purchase or through the item. COLOURBLIND ACCESSIBILITY As part of my Hackweek last month, I explored some ways we can make playing more accessible for players that experience different forms of colour blindness. Colour blindness is experienced by up to of men and of women, so it likely affects a good portion of our base. We ve tried to identify problematic areas in the world, as well as in our UI, and then make those colours configurable so every can customise the look of their to meet their needs. Since colour blindness comes in many forms, we ve exposed each option individually as well as some presets that we think will help for more common forms of the condition. We ve exposed the following options Tree marker colours Health Bar colour Hunger Bar colour Hydration Bar colour Name tag colour Enemy Name tag colour Ally Name tag colour eg. marked friendly in the contacts system Monument blocked colour the radius that appears when building close to a monument Mushroom colour We adjusted the contrast of the icons in the bar to make them stand out a bit more when in bright regions. Please get in touch if we ve missed a colour you find problematic to see, or if there are other accessibility options you think could help make playing more comfortable. You can contact us via the report menu, or opening a Support ticket. TUNNEL NETWORK VISIBILITY LAYER Way, way back in the ancient times of December, we shipped a feature that allowed us to separate the above ground and below ground networking groups, improving client performance and reducing network traffic. Unfortunately, we had to disable it pretty quickly on launch as we discovered an edge case where a small number of elevators that started in the above ground layer and ended in the below ground layer would teleport players into a void. To resolve this, we needed to rework how elevators functioned internally. This work has finally been completed, so we re the feature this month. Fingers crossed the feature sticks this time! This change should be invisible to players and offer better performance. ERRORS QOL I think it was time to say goodbye to this debug gibberish spammed in chat everytime you try to build anything. These errors have been moved from the chat to toast messages, which are just as responsive and most importantly, visible to players playing with the chat disabled. We wanted to reduce the confusion by making these errors more specific, when possible. The common Can not build in this area now becomes Blocked by, mentioning the name of the entity blocking you. It works with deployables, vehicles, building blocks and players. The infamous Too close from another building error message will now be Too close to. It will briefly highlight the building block in question. When trying to upgrade a building block, you now get a clear explanation of what exactly is preventing the upgrade. We the message priority of a few common deployables. So you now get Must be placed on a construction instead of Not enough space message when trying to place a bed on the terrain for example. A convar has been if you prefer to keep the error messages in chat LOCALIZATION A lot of effort has been put into improving localization this month. Most of the UI screens are now displaying languages correctly Many screens with truncated texts have been fixed Unlocalized texts have been addressed This is ongoing work, it not finished yet, and more improvements are planned for the coming months. Thanks to everyone contributing to localization, dedicating their time to make the more accessible to speakers. WORLD PLAYTEST Today, we opening Staging beta branch for public testing to gather feedback and bug testing ahead of next month world release, which is, if not the most significant updates, this year. The World aims to address many community requests surrounding the world. The will revamp cliffs, rivers, dive sites, and add, unique environmental areas such as canyons, lakes, and desert oases.

If you the owner of of these mods that see errors around invalid use of, then you should try switching to, and if that still does work, then in last case if you using FreeUnsafe with a collection, make sure to clear it. I making this breaking change because our old API were unsafe and allowed for memory leaks and bugs. Instead, I introduced a couple replacements that aim to be stricter and as a result safer. is now separate methods where T or a couple collections with T IPooled.

        "content": "TIN CAN ALARM This month, we adding the Tin Can Alarm, a primitive trap made from hanging tin cans. Crossing its wire will trigger the trap and cause a loud clatter, alerting anyone nearby to your presence. You can deploy it anywhere from your base to inside monuments. Use it strategically to cover access points and defend your positions. REPLICATED BUSH SOUNDS This month, we are changing how the classic bush rustle sounds work. Bush sounds will now be audible to players around you. Just with footsteps, you now need to take care of when you make noise in bushes. Going slower through a bush makes a quieter sound than when running through it. This change will cause the rustles made in hot air balloon tarps to be audible to players nearby, and operates in the same way as the bushes. UNDERWATER ITEMS Dropped items that end up in bodies of water will now sink more realistically instead of just dropping they are still falling through air. As well as slowing down and getting shifted around by currents they will emit some bubbles as they move and when they hit the ocean floor. This should make finding these items a little bit easier. ZIPLINE IMPROVEMENTS We ve made several to the powerline zipline system this month to make it a bit more pleasant to use. Ziplines will now pick the furthest possible destination instead of the closest We ve increased the maximum length a zipline can run from to Ziplines can now terminate at a higher point on the powerline structure and will pick these higher destinations when possible, reducing the amount of climbing required to continue the zipline. You can no longer get dismounted by trees when on a zipline. We already had several systems in place to prevent trees spawning in zipline paths, but it still happened very rarely. These should result in longer, higher ziplines that are safer to use. NPC VENDOR PRICE After looking over the data from last months wipe, it was clear that the dynamic vendor pricing system wasn t operating as well as it could have. It tended to drop to off all items relatively quickly in the wipe. We ve made a couple of this month Price now operate in real time rather than based on time. This should be more understandable and will work correctly on servers that manipulate time. Price now take place every real time hours. Last month the prices changed every minutes in real time by default, so this will make the prices change much more slowly. As usual we ll keep an eye on this and make going forwards. QUALITY OF LIFE Trains break barricades Trains can break through barricades that are deployed too close to the tracks. Bike fast turns Hold the Crouch key while driving to perform a faster turn Sidecar bike physics Sidecar bikes now drive more regular motorbikes. Horse terrain holes Horses can now enter terrain holes Train tunnels, the launch site ramp etc. Fire mode switch Switching your gun firemode will now a sound.

LOOTROOM PRINTS It Official You Can Now Get Licensed Printed Items! After years of watching from the side lines, we proud to officially announce that we partnered with Lootroom! Lootroom are now our partner for fully licensed printed guns and more. So we now working closer with them, providing this lovely and dedicated with assets to ensure that they continue to deliver high quality products to fans. Here Lootroom story It and during an exciting weekend with good friends, we kept joking about the fact that furnaces in always have to be running. This gave rise to the desire to have a small real furnace on the desk as a reminder of this great wipe. It did take long and it became clear a printer was needed! The test phase went well and we were so impressed with the result that we published the furnace on various platforms and received a lot of positive feedback. When the first purchase requests came in, we knew that the whole thing had potential and that there were many enthusiasts around the world who shared our interest in IRL loot. After some preparation, a first small online was created and the perfect name with the necessary domains was found Lootroom. Initially, our only consisted of the furnace in various sizes, followed by the Eoka and the. But after countless requests, the AK default was in May after a slight delay due to a real monster compared to the smaller products we had previously offered. For us, this involved a learning and conversion process, as our previous way of working was geared towards the smaller items. For example, we needed shipping boxes. Lone Design, the online for server plugins, became aware of us quite early on and we were able to offer our products there and thus reach even more players. At the same time, we set up a successful Etsy and have since broken the magic mark of sales and turnover. As we became better known, we received more and more requests for different skins and other irl loot. We created internal ranking lists with the most requested items, which we then gradually worked through. Over the years, we have continuously expanded our and now stock more than different items. A special milestone was achieved in September together with of the most successful content creators ever Blooprint we had his Blooprint SAR on offer for a limited time. The demand was overwhelming and it gave us great pleasure to see how much gamers around the world celebrated our products. We invested in more and more modern printers, a online presence and founded the official Lootroom GmbH in September, based in Nuremberg, Germany. We now operate more than printers that print IRL loot almost continuously. Our factory is streamed live on Twitch, Kick and YouTube to give anyone interested an insight into the creation process. Naturally, we prioritize the quality of our handmade products while maintaining a consistent stock to ensure prompt shipping. Customer service and engagement with the community are equally important to us. We have already shipped to over countries around the world and look forward to every customer that we can make happy with our IRL Loot. We put a lot of passion into our unique products. All of this now leads to the possibility to offer our products as officially licensed IRL loot. We are very hyped and incredibly excited to be working with our friends at Facepunch.

BICYCLES Bicycles can now be found across the map on roadsides, and at several monuments. The standard bike takes, but a variant allows a second to sit and shoot from the rear. The bicycles are as fast or as the motorbikes, but they easier to acquire, and they do use any fuel. Instead, they slowly consume your own food and water levels. Holding Sprint while biking will have the driver stand up and give you a bit more temporary power and speed. Sprint mode will automatically engage if you struggling up a hill. This feature wears out after a few seconds and needs time to recharge. HANDCUFFS AND PRISONER HOOD Take your enemies captive with the Handcuff and Prisoner Hood items! Use the Handcuffs on a surrendering friendly gesture or downed to take them prisoner restricting their inventory, belt, use and interact options. Handcuffed players can be pushed around and forced into vehicles and other mountables. Place the Prisoner Hood on your victim to block their vision and disable their map access, preventing them from seeing where you are taking them. Handcuffed players can hold their attack button to progress the unlock minigame. Fill the progress bar and the Handcuffs break, releasing you! Unlock progress is tied to the Handcuff item condition so that you can always eventually get free but being damaged or pushed will temporarily interrupt your breakout attempt! Additionally, performing the friendly gesture at any time lets other players inspect your full inventory and modify your belt a great way to show you not a threat or hiding something valuable! TRAVELLING VENDOR We a brand event! The Travelling Vendor. The vendor will spawn naturally on maps with ring roads and traverse the roads. The vendor sells a selection of wares from basic building materials to some of the best items in the. Each time the vendor spawns a random selection of items are chosen to sell, along with a different price each time. If you lucky, the vendor will decide to sell something at a discount, so keep an eye out! To get the vendor to stop just run up to it, but do stand blocking its way for too long or you will be ignored. It ca wait on you forever! It does take too kindly to gunfire or selling to hostiles so make sure you on your best behaviour. I want to say a huge thanks to the Discord Community for their incredible work in helping debug and improve the vendor. QUALITY OF LIFE Ceiling Light Wiring Ceiling lights IO points are now easier to target Improved Barricade Placement Can now place barricades on rocks and dirt roads DYNAMIC VENDOR PRICING To introduce a little more variety into the NPC vending system, this month we have introduced a change that increases or decreases the sale price of items purchased with scrap based on that item s popularity. The way it works is we now keep a running total of the average number of items sold every hours. Every hours if the number sold is less than the average then the price of the item will drop by for the next hours down to a minimum of. If the number of items sold has increased above the average then its price will be increased by to a maximum of extra, or twice the price. We will be starting prices at so they will likely drop for a while before settling to the market price. An example of the logic The average amount of SAM sites purchased in a hour window is, and the current price has no increases or decreases. At the end of a hour window we check and see that SAM sites have been purchased. Since the average has gone up, we raise the price by. Since the price is now more expensive, sales drop to over the next hours. Since this is below the average we then drop the price by, which results in a price increase in total. You can see the current discount and price when looking at an item on the map or, the price displayed is the final price and there s a small indicator that communicates what the current price change is and what that item s initial price was. You can easily tell at a glance what items are cheap and what items are expensive, as well as how much they ve changed price to make informed purchasing decisions. We ve only applied this to sales where the currency paid is scrap vending machines that offer scrap in exchange for items fish market, resource exchange, etc are unaffected. This will not apply to created vending machines. Why are we making this change? We believe the NPC vending meta can be shaken up a bit and this seems a fairer change than us just arbitrarily changing a bunch of prices across the board. This way the prices will increase and decrease based on behaviour and will vary from server to server. As usual we ll monitor how this goes over the next month and make as necessary. FURTHER MEMORY IMPROVEMENTS Building on last month work to reduce the overall number of objects in to save memory, this month we are rolling out even more improvements. We applied the same principle reducing the number of objects by combining them when possible but at the project level, so that most assets are already combined and streamlined in the build and don t need to be processed when starting the up. The streamlining process we use here is even more aggressive and results in even greater memory savings while reducing time spent processing assets. As well as these optimisations, we re going to be making last month renderer improvements now enabled by default. We believe this approach combined with last month improvements has resulted in about a gigabyte of reduced memory usage on a fresh server. This was a huge effort as it involved manually modifying hundreds of assets across the entire. Thanks to the valiant efforts of our QA we ve identified many cases where slight unintentional material and colour occurred but it s possible some more snuck through into the release so please let us know if you see anything that looks incorrect! Just last month, we have more improvements in the pipeline for next month including memory improvements to monument foliage and a process for loading monuments that will hopefully reduce loading times and further reduce memory usage. UNDERWATER VISIBILITY Underwater visibility has been messed up for a while now. It was an unintended consequence of us rewriting the way we shade things underwater, to make it more flexible. That low visibility has now been fixed, but we might continue to tweak it some more in subsequent patches. Since our last back in April, we have banned an additional accounts, of these were temporary, and the remaining were permanent bans. Here the breakdown per June Seismic Shift permanent bans temporary bans of which were automated reports May Meta Madness permanent bans temporary bans of which were automated, reports April Waves of Change permanent bans temporary bans of which were automated reports NOTES report data is only from Facepunch Official servers due to data reliability originating from servers, the total number of reports across all server since April is. Bans that were later reverted are excluded from these metrics. Bans are placed for multiple reasons. The numbers above do not strictly reflect only bans, but bans make up the vast majority of bans. A single can receive multiple bans, for example, if a user is temporarily banned and then later switched to a permanent ban, this is counted as bans in the above metrics. Over the last, we had unique players, and close to half a million daily active players. Using the metrics above, it could be interpreted that of the base are cheaters, it very common for cheaters to use many accounts over the course of the month. Cheaters often receive an account suspension, get another account, receive another ban, rinse and repeat inflating the true number. The above is to provide context and transparency, not to state we doing a good job, there is much more to be done in this area, and we are continuing to work on it. NEXT In the last blog, I discussed how we limited the information cheaters can and abuse from network data, such as knowing players health and buried stash locations, authorization lists from turrets and tool cupboards. The holy grail would be not networking nearby players and items you ca see. If a is behind a hill and you ca see them, do network the. If a tool cupboard is inside a base, do network the tool cupboard. This is server occlusion, and it difficult to get perfect. We currently experimenting with this and hope to do a slow rollout over the coming months, pending further internal testing. Additionally, we currently working on many experimental features to disrupt cheats, some of these are nearly completion and will be deployed. Last month, we teamed up with a third party to handle takedowns on our behalf. of the core objectives is aimed at material. The takedowns will be made at the request of Facepunch staff after manual review. There is no automation, and there is no room for innocent content to be taken down. In the past days, we taken down over media on social platforms We working on several other legal fronts, which are too early to discuss The next anticheat will be in November CREATIVE MODE Creative mode is a set of native tools Paddy and I have which allows players to freely build, place and experiment without needing additional plugins. You can enable creative mode for everyone on your server using the server convar or enable it just for a specific using PLAYERNAME. Once enabled, there are several convars you can enable which overrides standard build and placement restrictions allows resource free repairs and bypass the repair cooldown makes all building blocks free and adds the option to spawn blocks in a specific grade. allows the Hammer to upgrade and downgrade blocks for free. removes most placement restrictions when deploying objects. Will allow building in building blocked zones, in other TC zones and when intersecting other objects. allows an unlimited amount of line points and raises the distance limit when wiring IO entities to. adds an invisible colour option in the colour wheel. This was originally made to help our Media more efficiently build and film content, but we see this being helpful for QA purposes as well. Hopefully you find it helpful too!

You can configure its range from to meters foundation meters It will output a different power value depending on the type of explosion detected A list of power values from explosives power Grenade, Beancan power Explosive ammo, Satchel power, Rocket The idea is to let you detect and trigger circuits when you being raided. Alarms, traps the possibilities are infinite, we excited to see what you will come up with! BARRICADE PLACEMENT Traditionally, we blocked all forms of building inside Monuments. This made sense back in the day when Monuments were small in size and number, but over the years, the amount of land they take up has increased significantly. We want to reward players who pick a strategic location during a fight, but it hard to pick a good location when you in an empty field! This is why barricades can now be placed on the terrain around Monuments. This allows you to take cover as you enter and exit monuments, as well as take cover inside the open fields inside Monuments. Applies to Wood barricade Stone barricade Concrete barricade Sandbags Remember Monument Structures, Concrete, and Roads still block barricades at this time. Decay and melee protection has been adjusted to account for more relaxed placement minute decay hits with melee SEE DEPLOY GUIDE OF TEAMMATES Behold the ability to see what your teammate is placing and where it will be placed! This should clear up the exact location your teammate s are shouting while trying to build. By default, it only will show your teammate deploy guides when you are building. This can be changed via the options menu to Show or to be disabled. VISUAL FEEDBACK FOR BUILDING BLOCKED When allowing barricades to be placed into Monuments we realized it not that clear where the building blocked of Monuments actually starts! You will now see a red outline around the edge of monuments. This can be toggled in the options menu. Server owners can disable it via a convar if conflicts with custom Monuments. Monument building radius We took the opportunity to adjust the building blocked size of some Monuments. Larger Gas Station Lighthouse Mining Outpost Super Market Slightly Larger Dome Launch Site Smaller Arctic Research Base QUALITY OF LIFE Faster Code Locks Once a code is set, the last used button is much faster at entering the code Bone Fertiliser Bone fragments can now be used in a composter to create fertiliser Faster Window Crafting Window glass, shutters and bars now craft in instead of Skin Names See the name of skins at the Repair Bench, and a link to get them Helicopter Handbrake Idle helicopters no longer drift down slopes Reduced Speed Penalty Horse armour does slow your horse as much Salvaged Hammer Buff damage against deployables Mixing Table Ammo Recipes HV Ammo Incendiary Ammo to mixing table Industrial Conveyor UI Easier to search and setup industrial conveyors Block Explosives In TCs Prevent players from stashing their explosives in TCs Hammer UI Consistency Hammer always shows all options to reduce misclicks Reduce Volume Reduce volume of by to reduce strain on ears LOD Improvements Fixed monument prefabs appearing invisible from far Planter Autofill Hold Sprint to auto plant all held seeds in a single planter Vendor Attachments Able to see the attachments on weapons for sale in vending machines Chainsaw hit radius Adjusted the chainsaw hit radius to make it easier to hit the trees mark INSTANT REJOIN While a queue is better than nothing who remembers the days of spamming reconnect?, we want to avoid players getting stuck in a queue at all especially when it due to a crash.

It purely visual, it does change anything, and it works with hoses and Christmas lights! PAINTING IMPROVEMENTS I worked on a bunch of improvements for sign painting this month based on community feedback. There a mix of QoL and bug fixes, but they should all improve your painting experience! Made the painting UI follow your UI scale option a convar to switch which side the painting UI is on Increased the maximum brush size to was Fixed brush sizes below drawing nothing sometimes Fixed drawn brushes overlapping within the same stroke Fixed weird color blending behavior for the softest brush Fixed portrait and landscape frames using an incorrect aspect ratio paint texture no more squishing and export inconsistency This makes painting behave more other apps Fixes low opacity values not actually actually being low because the brushes overlap ELECTRICITY QOL Medium battery size Reduced medium battery size by, now fits under half walls Tesla Coil Igniter healing Tesla Coils and Igniters are now healed by your tool cupboard overtime Electrical Furnace Now automatically turned ON or OFF depending on whether they have power SAM Site a input to switch your SAM Site targeting mode using electricity Solar Panel Solar panels no longer take conditional damage when picked up Wiring near vehicles Vehicles no longer prevent you from wiring components FISHING We re making several fishing this month to try and shake up the broader fishing meta. Our current issue is that it s quite trivial to endlessly produce fish from a safe zone, then converting that fish to scrap. It s not the fastest way to earn scrap but it is pretty reliable. Our intention with the range of fish available to catch was always that you would work your way up the chain catch a sardine, use that to catch a trout, use that to catch a shark. By allowing raw fish meat to be used as a bait you could easily gut fish and catch dozens more fish with that meat, which could then be converted into even more fish. To break this loop, this month raw fish meat is now only worth bait and can be used in stacks of whole fish can and should be used as bait but you now run the risk of losing that fish when casting out. The idea is to introduce a mechanic. Do you cash out with your current trout catch or do you put them on line and for the sharks? To balance out this reduction in bait, we ve made several other forms of bait more useful. Several bait types can now be stacked if a fish requires bait to be caught and you stack Worms worth each, you can now catch that fish. This behaviour is applied across worms, grubs, berries and small fish, making these baits more viable. We ve increased the bait value of human meat, bear meat and wolf meat. The stack amount can be seen next to the bait value when selecting the item in your inventory. The Survival Fish Trap became a bit neglected after we introduced the Fishing Rod, so this month we ve adjusted it to make it more relevant. The trap now uses the same underlying system as the rod, meaning you can catch different fish in different water sources as well as catch better fish based on the bait provided. The only mechanical difference between these fish sources is that the trap can not catch the same fish as it has used as bait and the trap has a chance to lose the bait without catching the fish. TECH TREE COMBINING In order to save some space in bases, I ve modified the Tech Tree menu to now allow you to browse and unlock techs from lower Tech Trees eg. Access techs from a bench, access and trees from a bench. Use the tabs in the top left of the screen to switch between available tech trees. The workbench tax from last month is applied based on the Tech Tree level, so there will be no scrap cost as a result of this change. The tech tree now opens immediately when accessing the workbench, saving you a click. RENDERER MEMORY SAVINGS In hack week this month, I explored ways to reduce our memory usage, an area that is a real priority for us this year. While a lot of my experiments weren t workable, did actually end up saving several hundred megabytes of memory for very little cost, so it s shipping as disabled by default this month. A renderer in this case is simply a thing that is visible to the a crate, a rock, part of a structure, etc. Importantly for performance each renderer has LODs Level of Detail lower quality versions of each renderer that we switch to based on the distance to the players perspective. In Unity each of these LODs typically lives on a child object of a master parent object, so will have a child,, etc that we switch to. What I discovered during hack week is that in a proc gen map of size, we can have upwards of million objects in the world, each of these objects has some overhead we need to its position, rotation, what the object does, etc. In a renderers case, for every single renderer we had child objects, for each LOD level. I realised that in most cases each LOD object was just sharing a duplicate of all the information except for a different model, so I modified the system to detect when this happens and consolidate all needed information into a single object, then delete the child objects. By applying this to every renderer in the world, I was able to delete thousand objects from the world, which had a combined memory saving of pretty significant! This combination process is run every time the is launched, we re currently working on a change to make most of these modifications before we build the, which should yield further savings next month. Due to how risky this change is deleting thousand objects has had some unintended side effects that we ve now fixed, we re shipping this feature off by default, but we ll monitor it s usage through the month and likely turn it on by default sometime next month. The convar is and you ll need to restart your after turning it on or off. Let us know how it goes for you! tldr less objects less RAM HORSE IMPROVEMENTS It would be amiss to say horses have not had their share of issues over the last few months. So following community feedback I looked into a solution that would resolve the difficulties players have had with horse navigation. Alongside some minor adjustments to prevent horses from getting stuck and preventing unnecessary stamina depletion, I introduced the ability for horses to walk backwards. This seemed the most logical approach to alleviate horses getting stuck and should be an overall improvement to navigation. CINEMATIC ENTITIES I a few more cinematic entities this month for creators to use in their video and image projects. These can be spawned by server and can be hidden via console with group numbers. The additions include More spot and point light variants Unlit backdrops and cyc walls variants variants Visibility Commands Cinematic entities assigned to different groups which allows them to hidden if desired. Use the command followed by group numbers to hide them. Cinematic entities are now assigned to specific group numbers which allows them to be hidden if desired. Use the command followed by or more group numbers to set their visibility to hidden. The groups are setup so nothing makes all entities visible lighting backdrops props misc You can hide or multiple groups in the same command line for example Hides lighting only keeps light effect but hides the mesh Hides both lighting and backdrop meshes all cinematic entities You can hide cinematic entity groups in demos with followed by the same group numbers above. To revert to the visiblity of the entities back to their original states from the demo recording, use TWITCH DROPS Join us for the Bellum Redemption event June! There will be Twitch drops so be sure you get synced! Please be aware of scams. Facepunch will never contact you. Only ever use our official website. TURRET INTERFACE VISUAL FEEDBACK Turret interference has been effective at preventing players from surrounding their base in of turrets, however it lacked feedback on how exactly to stay under the limit. Turret interference will now be shown while holding a wire tool and looking at a turret. It will be shown in the hotbar while building. While this is accurate most of the time keep in mind this only counts turrets you are authed on it ignores enemy turrets. This mismatch is required to prevent players from holding a turret and seeing how many turrets are inside an enemy base. FULL DEVBLOG HERE",

        "content": "AIMCONE REDUCTION Any movement in would modify your baseline Aimcone so that shots taken while in motion were somewhat inaccurate. This was supposed to discourage running and gunning. The problem with this is that any kind of motion while in a firefight puts you at a disadvantage minor dodging and increases the amount of RNG experienced by the. What I done is reduced this penalty to zero to start, and blend it up to the full amount after rapid fire shots. This means is you can now strafe and dodge while tap firing and not experience a huge aiming penalty, however full auto will be penalized. I adjusted the Aimcone curve modifiers for a few weapons so that more shots have a higher probability of landing closer to the center. This has been applied to the Custom SMG, SAP and. WEAPON ATTACHMENT UPDATES Weapon mods have received some love this month. BURST MOD The duration between bursts while using the burst mod has been significantly reduced to firerate instead of firerate. HOLOSIGHT The holosight mesh has had its edges thinned so that less of your vision is obscured while using it. This is a stopgap until we produce a model for it. I fixed the Holosight reticle being affected by motion blur. MUZZLE BRAKE BOOST Both the muzzle brake and muzzle boost have had their negatives reduced, they now have less damage reduction and less damage falloff and should prove to be far more useful. TWEAKS In addition, I made some to the recoil, damage fall off, bullet velocity, and burst mode of the. This should now be the best in class AR. Everything subject to change. SAFEZONE RECYCLERS Starting today, Recyclers in safezones have been nerfed. Their cycle time has been increased to seconds and they now yield of what they used to. This is the price you now must pay for safety. However, the recyclers found at monuments have the same cycle time as before but now yield! This is to reward players taking the risk out in the open. While I am aware that a great many keyboards may be smashed as the death screen fades in over the droning hum of the active recycler, I still have hope this helps usher in a era of roaming and monument combat. SALE SALE SALE! Some great items were not used because they were way too expensive. To that end I made the following HV Ammo Gunpowder cost reduced significantly, and the yield per craft increased to match non HV ammo. Torpedos Craft yield increased from to. Incendiary Rockets The cost has been drastically reduced and their damage flame spread increased. Drones Tech trash is no longer a requirement for drones. HMLMG Gear cost has been reduced. EXTERNAL STRUCTURE Large External Gates and Walls now require the to stand still for seconds when placing, making them less useful for immediate PvP encounters in the wild. We felt that being able to place down such large structures in a short amount of time felt at odds with our style of combat that rewards situational awareness and environmental tactics. WOODEN BARRICADE RESIZE To fill the void left by the external wall regarding dynamic cover during PvP, we have doubled the size of the deployable wooden barricade. The wooden barricade remains instantly deployable and provides a moderate amount of cover without being overpowered or polluting the landscape with large, unsightly deployable. This is without a doubt a large shift to PvP, we be monitoring these carefully BRADLEY Some further tweaks to the Bradley this month. Scientists now spawn in stages, based on the Bradley health, and there some Heavy scientists thrown in the mix now, too. At health, scientists will spawn At health, more will spawn At health, final scientists will spawn There been some tweaks to make some of the Scientists more aggressive and use varying attack angles. DOOR CONTROLLER You can now use door controllers without worrying about raiders abusing them to open your doors! This is accomplished by unpairing door controllers once your TC is destroyed requiring code lock authorization for pairing. They are much easier to setup as they can now be placed just code locks. This should reduce the pain of constantly opening and closing the doors of your base especially when your teammates tend to leave them open. Now deployable on doors code locks Automatically paired when placed side inputs and Unpaired when the associated tool cupboard is destroyed We carried on improving electricity by adjusting components and fixing various bugs this month. Thanks again to the community for reporting bugs and suggesting ideas. The full change log of each component can be in the section at the bottom of the blog. PATROL HELICOPTER We know the latest helicopter had some mixed feedback, so we revised them. No zones should feel a lot more fair, and most major bugs experienced with heli since the last are now patched. Monument Crashing the helicopter will now attempt to crash at a nearby monument on death. It wo crash at monuments with safe zones outpost, fishing village, etc. This can be disabled by server owners via Flee Behavior heli would previously flee when it sometimes did mean to. Damage to start a flee has been tweaked, ensuring a flee every time you quickly remove of its overall HP. Numerous Fixes Improvements heli will now properly target you on boats, cargo, trains and other moving entities. Targeting fixes and performance improvements have been made throughout the code. More legacy bugs such as heli not exploding immediately on impact with certain terrain are fixed. LAUNCH SITE LOOT The Launch site loot had received an overhaul. Before, the loot inside the main building shared the same respawn group as the rest of the launch site, meaning loot inside the main building was never guaranteed. Loot had a chance to spawn elsewhere at the monument, which felt discouraging when completing the puzzle and running the main building. The main site building now has a dedicated respawn group, which guarantees loot crates when the puzzle resets. Additionally, more loot now spawns throughout the monument. UNDERWATER IMPROVEMENTS Underwater vision has been improved substantially. You can now see much farther when using goggles and even more so when viewing out a submarine porthole. In addition, the surface accuracy of submarine torpedoes has been vastly improved and torpedoes were made cheaper to produce by way of an increased craft yield. Lastly, the duo submarine fires torpedoes slightly faster than the solo. BUILDING QOL Tool Cupboard Auth Friend Can authorize other players on a tool cupbard Demolish High Walls Can demolish high walls gates for after placement Fixed High Wall Snapping Hold SHIFT to disable snapping Foundation Placement Fixed foundation placement under roofs floors Foundation Debris Foundations now drop debris Floor Debris Floors now drop debris TECH TREE We re making some to how the Tech Tree works to try and incentivise styles of. Starting this month you will notice that the and workbench tech trees now have a tax rate applied to them which will increase the cost of unlocking items. We re starting this at for and for. This cost increase only applies to unlocking via the Tech Tree, researching items via the Research Table is unchanged. Our thinking behind this is that we feel the Tech Tree progression path has become a little stale and needs to be shaken up, but we don t want to lose the advantages that the Tech Tree brought to progression making difficult to find blueprints attainable in a way that felt fair and not as at the mercy of RNG. While there are a number of avenues we can use to try and make both forms of progression feel more balanced this feels a simple and understandable starting point. As with all of our we ll be closing a close eye on this and will likely make further in the future. CARGO SHIP It s been great to see the reception to last month Cargo, we hope you ve all enjoyed some very very intense firefights. Based on the feedback we received we re making a couple of this month The Cargo Ship will now dock at both harbors if they exist on a map before leaving. Note that any containers that have already been placed on a ship will be deleted when it starts its approach to the next harbor. You can now mouse over the ship on the map to see if it has already docked. The containers that are spawned to be placed on the Cargo Ship will now be spawned when it starts its approach about away from the harbor rather than when the ship arrives at its dock, giving you more time to hide in the containers. The container spawn points have been mildly tweaked so that all of the containers should be accessible, although you might need to do some climbing. We hope these make the event a bit more understandable at a glance as well as make the combat encounters more interesting. VIEWMODEL RENDERERS Since implementing a dedicated viewmodel renderer system back in April, all of our viewmodels have been split between the old and system. The primary stumbling blocks were viewmodels with lots of particle effects and lights torches, flamethrowers, etc. While we covered most of the high impact cases of viewmodel jittering by supporting guns how often do you use the birthday cake on oil rig? we ve been wanting to consolidate everything for a while. This month we ve updated all of the viewmodels to use the renderer so they should appear smooth and jitter free regardless of where you are in the world. The affected viewmodels Both flamethrowers Water Bucket Beancan Grenade Molotov Cocktail Flashlight Birthday Cake Garry s Mod Toolgun Poker playing cards Lunar Year spear Minigun Paddle You should see no visible if it all working correctly. AI PERFORMANCE FIXES I investigated and addressed a couple of AI performance issues that were causing the AI to take longer to process than necessary, especially on servers that have been running for a while. This should help with AI server performance across the board. EFFECTS PERFORMANCE After noticing occasional framedrops during gunfights, I spent some time investigating the issue and found out that our impact effects prefab warmup was working as intended. All impact effects are now warmed up correctly during loading times. This should drastically reduce the stuttering when spawning a big amount of effects prefab for the first time when a fight starts and bullets start flying. This has a very little if no impact on loading times. MAP UPLOADING Procedural maps are now automatically uploaded from servers to our backend so players can just download them instead of generating them when they first join the server. This should significantly reduce the time it takes to join a server for the first time after it wipes. It may reduce the number of players seeing is not responding popups while joining servers for the first time. HARMONY Harmony is modding platform shipped with the server. It powers modding frameworks Oxide Carbon, as well as standalone mods. We upgraded from Harmony Harmony which brings us up to date with the latest features additional stability. This requires mod authors to recompile their Harmony mods. Fortunately the majority of mods only need to change a single line. Before using Harmony After using HarmonyLib Players should need to worry as the majority of large servers already started updating their mods before the went live. Server owners please keep an eye out for mod updates as every Harmony Mod will needed to be updated. ELECTRICITY CHANGELOG Tesla Coil, Igniter To stop them from, they are now disabled upon reaching",

        "content": "CARGO SHIP DOCKING We ve given both Harbors a fresh coat of paint this month, with a significant amount of visual and gameplay. These support the Cargo Ship docking process, which allows the ship to adjust it course and dock with the harbor. Each harbor has a island that can be reached by crossing a rotating bridge, floating containers or a daring set of jumps across cranes. This island becomes a stronghold once the Cargo Ship docks as it becomes sheltered from the rest of the harbor. The ship will pick the first harbor it passes to dock and will only dock once. Once docked, the cranes in the Harbor will spring into life and move several containers from the docks onto the deck of the ship. These containers have openable doors and can be hidden in, so they present a way to smuggle aboard the ship and another threat for players already on the ship to contend with. These containers will be deposited in locations that are generally above the deck, in some cases by several meters. This should present an interesting tactical situation when attacking the ship as well as defending it. We ve ship doors above the water line that allow access to the lower interior level of the ship and provide additional ways to board or traverse the monument while the ship is docked. By default the Cargo Ship replenishes it loot every minutes up to times. When the ship docks at the harbor it will attempt to trigger of those loot refreshes, although if all three have already happened it will be unable to spawn any more loot. The Cargo Ship horn will sound seconds prior to it departure once you hear that horn it time to get moving or you might end up back out at sea. We think these combined will lead to Cargo Ship being a much more contested PvP environment for groups of all sizes. We interested to see how a traditionally lower intensity monument the Harbors adjust to periodic bouts of high intensity action. OILRIGS The Oilrigs receive an upgrade this month, with an underwater access. This way to get onto the Oilrig will add a path into both structures Level floors. This provides a different, and possibly safer way into the monument. It is a way to the players on board by short circuiting the docks at the rigs water line. The extra rooms inside see the addition of a CCTV desk that allows you to observe in place the camera feeds of the monument. MINIGUN The iconic minigun has been to the which is used by the Heavy Scientists. It takes a moment to spin up, but when it does, it unleashes a massive amount of ammunition, making targets much easier to hit. It a rare drop useable by players and you must be at a workbench level to add ammunition to it as it can not be reloaded in the field. It takes seconds to spin up and lowers your movement speed while the spin is engaged. RETRO TOOL CUPBOARD We thrilled to announce tool cupboard DLC skin! The Retro Tool Cupboard can be crafted as usual using the skin picker or applied to an existing Tool Cupboard using the Spray can item. The Retro Tool Cupboard monitors display live information such as upkeep time, resources, and the number of blocks used to calculate upkeep costs. However, the data is only visible on the monitors when authorized. The Retro Tool cupboard does require power, the lower half of the Retro Tool Cupboard behind the glass panel displays current inventory upkeep amounts and tools. When approaching the Retro Tool cupboard design, we felt aesthetics were critical. The tool cupboard is the heart of any base and should be instantly recognizable. You can purchase Retro Tool cupboard skin or at item. MILITARY FLAMETHROWER In addition to the minigun, the Heavy Scientists have had their arsenal upgraded with a, military tier flamethrower. This weapon deals massive damage to targets up to meters away and creates walls of fire which can be used for area denial. I modified how flamethrowers deal damage to players making them an extremely effective PvP weapon. PATROL HELICOPTER IMPROVEMENTS The patrol helicopter was of the largest banks of code still in the. It stood up well, but there were a bunch of fixes and improvements that needed to happen. Let start with the improvements. Orbital The regular helicopter attack strafe was getting pretty old. It followed a regular pattern and most of our values were fixed internally. This has been changed. During an attack run the helicopter will randomise a bunch of values, including rocket amount, drop off distance, turn speed etc. These are relatively minor adjustments, but they should help make each fight with the helicopter feel a little more fresh. We a attack phase in the strafing run. The helicopter will turn, begin orbiting your position and pummel you with rockets from all directions. This will randomly happen after each strafe. It super fun to, and helps bring back the excitement and danger of taking heli. Aggro Improvements A feature has been introduced. These are invisible to the. When a damages heli a zone is and the zone is assigned a score. This score is based on how much damage heli has taken from that specific zone. Heli will now seek out targets based on zones and damage scores rather than the perceived randomness of before. When there are minimal players and by extension minimal zones. Heli will work similarly to before, but when more zones are introduced heli will prioritise attacking the people that are attacking it, in a more controlled and deliberate manner. You are still free pickings to the side gunners, but your house should be blasted anymore in the confusion. Zones When taking heli, the basic principle is to get, and keep aggro. zones make this a little more difficult, and now encourage some movement when taking heli. When a zone performs enough damage to heli too quickly, then that zone is marked as a zone. Heli will flee the area, and attempt to avoid it as best as it can. This is to encourage heli to get out of areas that are going to kill it too quickly. Encouraging bigger groups to chase, build defenses as they and bring more PVP to the whole map. Bug A bunch of legacy bugs that existed with heli are now patched. These include being stuck on targets, disappearing, not exploding in the ocean, as well as a bunch of proxy issues that were fixed by the aggro adjustments. Other adjustments have been made to how heli patrols work, and you should see it moving around a bit more now, rather than just sticking to the monuments. Server Convars this will the no and aggro zones. When turned off, the helicopter will largely behave the way it used to with target picking and aggression. this sets the required percentage of damage done to heli in order for it to flee and create a zone. A value of or over will effectively disable no zones and stop the flee mechanic. It will no doubt need some further revisions and after this release. Keep us updated on how your heli takes. Have fun! ELECTRICITY This month we are taking care of our fellow electricians! Bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and major are coming to electricity. First of all, we any power requirements from all logic gates. Being creative and adding logic to your circuits wo be at the expense of acquiring a linear or exponential amount of power any more. While being a great quality of life for master electricians, we believe that removing this pain point will increase the use of electricity in general. Therefore, the following components wo require power or drain batteries anymore Splitter Electrical Branch Blocker Root Combiner Memory Cell RAND Switch XOR Switch AND Switch OR Switch Timer Switch Smart Switch Pressure Pad Button Any other active components turrets, sensors, lights, etc remain unchanged and will still need power to function. BUG FIXES These power limitations were overly amplified by a multitude of power drain bugs and unintended behaviors that we worked on fixing. Here are the most important ones Fixed AND, OR gates draining batteries on both sides instead of only the side with the highest power input Fixed auxiliary draining power unnecessarily Fixed memory cell draining battery on both sides instead of from the active output Prevent electrical branch from draining power when nothing is connected to its branch out side Fixed unpowered components draining batteries, much more common now that branches do not waste power anymore QUALITY OF LIFE Along these, we worked on improving how you deploy electrical components Fixed the differences between the deploy guide and the actual position where your component is placed Components are now aligned to walls and wo rotate based on your view angle You can now align your components together when deploying them on walls by holding left shift This applies to all electricity, industrial and fluid items. We planning on extending it to any type of deployable in the future. NEXT STEPS There as more fixes and improvements that did make it into this. Expect more in the coming months, including plans to rework some components and extending their functionalities. Many thanks to our electricians community for pointing out bugs and suggesting ideas.

Over the past couple of months, we have slowly eliminated or limiting information leaks which cheaters abuse to aid them in several ways. For example, players health, Tool Cupboards and turret authorization lists could be in the network data, allowing cheaters to use and gain a further unfair advantage. These are now fixed. In continuing efforts to cheaters and clean up many issues, especially around information leaks, buried stashes are no longer networked, meaning cheaters will no longer know where stashes are buried. There is much more to be done in this area, and we are working on it. Expanding the support size over the past year has allowed us to get more support staff focusing on, which includes going and dealing with and disrupting cheaters directly based on reports. Some staff over the coming months will be dedicated solely to measures. This is limited to Facepunch servers, but across the board. In addition to the above, we deployed some stricter measures surrounding, eliminated several priority exploits, and will deploy further measures soon. In the last month bans have been applied of which were permanent of which were temporary cheating reports received of bans were applied automatically Since the January bans have been applied of which were permanent of which were temporary cheating reports received of bans were applied automatically Based on fiscal quarters bans applied in bans applied in bans applied in bans applied in bans applied in Notes Bans are placed for multiple reasons, the numbers above do not strictly reflect only bans, but bans do make up the vast majority of bans. A single can receive multiple bans, for example, if a user is temporarily banned and then later switched to a permanent ban, this is counted as bans in the above metrics. BRADLEY SCIENTISTS The Bradley has some passengers this month! Scientists can now deploy from the Bradley to help defend it with some extra firepower. This applies to both the Launch Site Bradley and the Bradley that spawns along roads at the end of the month. IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Seed Sack World Model seed world model Mushroom World Model mushroom world model Monument CCTV Station dedicated CCTV station within monuments SRV DNS SUPPORT I support for SRV DNS record to. This means you can now create nice domain names for your servers without needing to specify the port or be forced into the default port. I used this information to improve the favorites list. Servers that have a working DNS record set up would save the domain name when favoriting so that favorites should never break as long as the domain name is pointing to the right place. More information on how to set this up is on the wiki. PING ESTIMATION If you have searched for servers in the browser you probably noticed the large amount of fake ping it impossible to have ping to both a US and EU server. This is a side effect of certain forms of DDOS protection and has forced us to create a custom system to estimate ping rather than use ping value. There is a checkbox below Use Cache called Estimate Ping. We will enable this by default in the future once we confirm the estimated values are more accurate than the existing ones. FULL BLOG POST",

        "content": "TUTORIAL ISLAND A common story we hear from players is that they have seen their playing, so they pick up the and then bounce off it due to how harsh and unforgiving the experience can be. This month s Tutorial Island is our attempt to provide players with a safe environment to learn the basic controls and mechanics of before being set loose in the main with other players. Everyone will be prompted to start the tutorial when they first spawn this month, if you re a long term feel free to decline the tutorial and we won t ask you about it again. Once the starts the Tutorial, they will be respawned on a dedicated island where an NPC will guide them through the first half hour of gameplay. This island is tightly controlled and can not be reached by other players. Throughout this process players will learn some key concepts Basic movement Crafting Building bases Upgrading bases Respawning Basic combat Resources Looting containers Cooking Using Furnaces Workbenches Using a vehicle This obviously isn t an exhaustive list of everything there is to learn in, but we feel this is a good starting point for a. Our guiding principle when designing this sequence has been if a emulates exactly what they did on the Tutorial Island once they get into the main, will they have a fighting chance? The tutorial itself should take less than minutes if you re familiar with general FPS controls and concepts, likely around an hour if you are not a regular FPS. Once complete you will be dropped off into the main with the same resources as any other completing the Tutorial Island does not give you any advantages in regular gameplay. For server owners running mods that change core gameplay features, you may find that parts of the tutorial don t work or maybe showing the tutorial isn t appropriate for your server minigame servers for instance. You can control whether the tutorial is active via the convar it false by default. While false players wo be prompted to start the tutorial on your server and they will not be able to manually start the tutorial. We ve a server tag to help players find and filter servers by their tutorial compatibility, add tut to your server tags to advertise your tutorial compatibility. Brand players will have this filter on when they first use the server browser. VENDOR UI REFRESH Our outdated tooltip popup for checking vendor stock urgently needed an upgrade. It felt out of place when compared with the marketplace UI. Thus, a plan was devised to merge both into a single unified system. This will be rolled out in parts, with this being part. This first part fully replaces the old blue tooltip popup with an interface that clearer, more, and scalable. Now, it easy to understand what you purchasing and how much is costs. Overall, this first pass on the vendor UI provides a great foundation to expand on. Single Vendor Interface Items are now displayed clearly with the cost and stock counts easily visible. Multi Vendor Interface Accordions are used to hold vendors with large amounts of listings. This keeps everything easy to, whilst still giving users flexibility to add a bunch of listings. While working on this, we noticed some QOL issues with finding items before purchasing. The marketplace offers useful features search and filtering that the standard map does have. It would be great to have these abilities everywhere. Part will unify the marketplace UI with the vendor UI. You will still have to travel to the marketplace to buy things via drone, but the actual underlying UI will be merged together. This will provide the same functionalities as enjoyed at the marketplace to the regular map vendor UI, whilst bringing the improved style and ease of use of this vendor UI to the marketplace. NIGHTLIGHT Today, I addressing an issue we often hear about from the community. Navigating the during nighttime. While the night cycle is a cruicial element of the gameplay loop, it can be a literal stumbling block not seeing what directly ahead. The problem of gamma hacking where players unfairly enhance their night vision by tweaking monitor settings, has been a thorn in our side, necessitating a darkness RGB to counteract such exploits. To that end I come up with the Nightlight feature. Basically it a shader that subtly illuminates a small radius around the, mimicking the effect of natural moon light. This localized lighting ensures that while you can see just enough to navigate at night, the vast darkness beyond remains dark. Distant pixels are kept at absolute darkness RGB, effectively rendering gamma hacking useless for spotting threats or resources. beyond a few meters We believe this approach strikes a good balance, enhancing the night experience without compromising fair. I hope it helps! IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Rangefinder Rangefinder to binoculars Attack Helicopter Flare Attack helicopter flares now take seconds to reload Safe Metal Detecting Metal detectors no longer able to find loot in safezones Attire Conflict Visual feedback when switching attire conflict ITEM UI This month, we ve made improvements to the interface. These are part of a UI overhaul for the menu screen that we re currently working through. of the main improvements is adding in a custom view for each of the general items, giving a better look at what an item looks or what is contained within a pack. For example, the Abyss pack, we now show a version of the trailer, the items contained within the pack in a turntable, media and a bit of information about the pack. These are aimed at improving the experience of using the, more transparency in regards to what you re potentially purchasing, and improving it from a visual point of view too. Interface view, with improvements in regards to scaling and legibility of the items. Item Model We improved the interface for the model that appears when you tap on an item. A key addition being an animated version of the skin. General Model We a view for each general item. Some of these include trailers, items contained within as a turntable as well as media and general information about the item. These views hopefully give a better understanding of what you getting in the purchase.

        "content": "BACKPACKS Backpacks have been of most highly requested additions for several years, and what is a survival without backpacks? This month, we excited to bring you the small and large backpack, allowing players to carry more loot. Inventory space has become more scarce as more items have been to over the years. Small Backpack The small handmade backpack provides slots can be crafted for cloth and five sewing kits at a workbench. It is a default blueprint and will take seconds to craft. Large Backback The backpack carries a whopping storage slots and is uncraftable, found in military loot. How To Use Both are worn in the backpack slot and drop off your character on death. They can be looted on the ground be careful if dropping in a safe zone! or from inside your own inventory. They take seconds to pickup off the ground and despawn slower when filled with valuable items up to hours. Currently, there are no negative effects from using a backpack. REMAINS BACKPACK To help differentiate regular remains from the backpack models we ve given the remains a visual refresh. This model has a open and closed visual state so you can tell at a glance if a bag has been opened by anyone. There is some visual debris around an opened bag if the bag has more than items in it. METAL DETECTOR The metal detector allows you to find metal objects hidden beneath the ground. Use the green lights to find the general area of an object, then when the green lights are all fully lit, hold the right mouse button to start sweeping the ground more closely and illuminate the yellow lights. When all the yellow lights are lit up, a flag will be placed. Dig this flag up with any melee tool and grab your treasure! Different areas of the world will yield different types of loot, for example, what you may find on the beach will be different than what you find at the roadside or fields. WEAPON I modified the animations for the and they should feel a bit less floaty and more snappy when reloading and aiming. I reduced the additional recoil while moving when using the SAP.

To address the comments we have made the more mild. Above are a few examples, you can find more here. REDUCING SERVER SIDE ENTITY COUNTS As mentioned in our start of the year blog post, memory usage is a key area of concern this year. aspect I ve been looking at lately is entity counts. Anything that gets networked in a server is an entity, so every tree, building block,, vehicle, etc. What might seem counterintuitive is that many Items in your inventory are entities, specifically an entity we call a Planner. This is the blue sheet your visually equips when they are deploying something eg. a sleeping bag. Any Item that can be deployed in your inventory will have a corresponding Planner entity. This entity is created when the item is created, and will exist on the server typically in the players hands or at the world origin if they are in a container until that item is used or destroyed. We need this entity as it handles all the logistics of spawning the deployed version of the item. To illustrate how many entities this creates we looked a list of entities on Facepunch towards the end of the November wipe last year. Out of entities, of them were Planners and are the largest count of entity the next largest was Walls at. Since Planners are technically only needed when the has the item equipped on their belt, this is a big waste of memory and processing time as well as needlessly bloating server save files. This month we ve rolled out a change that will only spawn a Planner for these Items once the Item is in a players inventory, then delete the entity when it is moved back into an inventory. This should dramatically cut down on the number of entities taking up memory for no real reason. We applied this change to Syringes and Bandages, specifically because these item types don t need an Entity if they aren t in the players inventory and are often stored in large quantities and respectively in the above sample. Syringes in particular have been a performance bottleneck for the Industrial system due to the need to create and destroy an Entity every time the item is moved, so this change should have flow on server performance improvements there as well. We think this change should reduce entity counts on the server by roughly but we ll be monitoring the results over time. INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE We received reports from several servers this month with Industrial performance issues. After investigating we found some extremely complex conveyor systems moving large amounts of Syringes as the culprit. The above to Entity counts will largely solve the issue, but I ve a convar to better handle time budgeting in these situations. While the Industrial system is time budgeted per frame eg. Only process three conveyors per frame it struggled if conveyor took an excessive amount of time eg. conveyor takes the allocated budget. This convar will allow the conveyor system to stop half way through a transfer if it is taking too long. Crucially it will then resume the transfer from where it left off on the next tick, so the final results should be the same, they may just take longer in real time. From the players perspective, this may result in conveyors splitting things in unintuitive ways eg. a conveyor splitting into three boxes might do on the first tick, then the last on the last tick but it should eventually produce the same result. Therefore we d recommend turning this on selectively if a server is experiencing Industrial performance issues. As well as this convar some general performance optimisations were made, so things should be a little faster across the board in the Industrial system. MEMORY OPTIMIZATIONS Despite having some guards in place, asset memory can easily run ouf of control. We keep adding awesome content and, unfortunately, it keeps increasing our memory footprint. In order to be able to sustain this rate of content expansion, memory usage has to be low and stable, regardless of world complexity. Until we can implement more aggressive and effective streaming, every once in a while we have to sit down and look at what we missed and make the necessary corrections. On this we nuked almost GB of memory usage in shader assets, plus a few hundred MB on textures and meshes. This is a bit of a soft start, in regards to textures and meshes, but we expect to reduce memory usge by a few more gigabytes in the coming months. We do care about memory and performance, and we actively working on it. This is just the first stage of many that will target not only improve memory usage but frame rate. IMPROVED TEXTURE QUALITY Modern universally depend on asset compression to maximize the efficient utilization of available system memory. To justify the efforts invested in compression, developers often turn to lossy techniques, which, particularly in the realm of textures, frequently lead to a compromise in image quality. was long overdue for a texture quality review. Below is a before and after. The improvement in detail and color fidelity can be striking in some cases right. This is an ugly texture but it a good example of how compression can ruin a high frequency image. Regions of pixels get merged together and color shifts slightly left. Texture compression was being used quite aggressively and, after tweaking some settings, we were able to significantly improve image quality without sacrificing memory. In the end, because a lot of textures had untapped potential for savings, we actually ended up saving runtime memory, at the cost of disk space, while still improving overall image quality. MARKERS WITH NV GOGGLES These were quite while wearing NV Goggles, especially near the screen edges, where they would sometimes float above seemingly nothing. This has now been fixed. IMPROVED VEHICLE BEHAVIOR Doors and Gates have been cancelling their animation when hitting a vehicle since Modular Cars were introduced, however that would sometimes lead to cases where the animation cancelling would crush vehicles if they hit the from the opposite side. This has been improved this month and colliding with an animated in the direction that it is moving will no longer cause the animation to cancel. This should lead to less cars getting crushed.",

Next month we limit the number of shelters players can have placed at any time. Forwards We have a ton of content currently in development, and if you keeping an eye on our commits page, you already know some of them. This year, you can expect to see and revamped monuments such as the compound, a tutorial system for players, motorcycles, revamped server listings UI, weapons. A hot topic we see is improving the world and the environment. We have multiple patches lined up in to improve the world, creating unique buildable areas such as canyons and lakes and improving rivers. Procedurally generated caves, additionally, we be exploring and improving cliffs and rock formations. We plan to address the defender advantage of monuments and events the cargo ship. We are to rework the harbours, and the cargoship will soon dock with the harbours. Outlined above is skimming the surface of only a few key features. We have a lot more planned. But what about? Performance? Performance is always an ongoing process. We constantly adding and improving features monthly, often hidden in changelogs. There is no magic button to increase performance. Instead, it is a slow process of small gains. Our immediate attention is on bringing memory usage down, which can provide a more stable and consistent FPS experience for some users. We already got several improvements ready for internal testing and hopefully release in the coming month or. This year, we be bringing onboard hires with a focus on performance. We continue to share news on performance in our monthly development blogs. Rendering? We first announced networked bases in September. rendering aimed to reduce bases popping in, significantly increase the view distance of structures and reduce some performance overhead when rendering bases. Immediately we ran into some issues, applied fixes,, and ran into further problems, this process repeated a few times and then went into development limbo. It was clear to us that we pushed this out too soon, with a lack of internal testing. We making time over the next months to thoroughly test and evaluate rendering with the hope of releasing it publically again in March. Pets? If you follow our public commits page, you know we worked on pets for several months and suddenly stopped. For several reasons, we halted this project, and it will not be this year. Our goal is still to have pets in, but we have several obstacles to overcome first. We currently hiring a AI programmer to join the to help improve our AI and eventually assist in pets development. Nexus? Again, if you follow our public commits, you have seen the Nexus system. What is the Nexus system? In short, the Nexus system allows us to cluster servers together and enable players to travel from server to server to server using flight and boats, effectively linking an unlimited amount of servers, creating an environment where you can interact with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of players and explore multiple maps without the need to move servers permanently. Nexus opens many doors to us, for example, dedicated arctic maps and maps with advanced AI and resource maps but with a dangerous environment. We do plan for Nexus to replace the current existing server format as you currently, but rather an optional way to if you wish if you choose to do so. We plan to release Nexus in when ready, but much work is still ahead of us. Night times? Another hot topic within the community, for years between, we experimented with brighter nights. Whatever we tried, we saw many players using tools to gamma boost to see at night and gain an unfair advantage over other players. It a complex issue to address, if we increase light levels at night, we reopen old lessons which we know did not work in the past. Night time acts as a natural time for players to take a break, craft, build or use the cover of darkness to move loot or harvest resources, we want to retain this and allow players to use darkness to their advantage with the use of night vision and light sources. We do agree that being unable to see entirely at night and unable to navigate around is not a good or fun experience, and we plan to revisit the subject early this year. The aim of the change is to allow players to navigate around at night more easily, if you want to PvP at night, then flashlights and night vision are still a.? A hugely complex topic. We work closely with Epic Easy, to aid in detecting and banning cheaters in. We do disclose what we do and do do when it comes to for good reason. The more information we disclose publicly, the more it can assist cheaters and cheat developers to circumvent measures, it a huge. of the best measures is obscurity. The fewer people know what EAC and we are doing, the better. This comes with the drawback of not communicating enough, on the outside, it appears we doing nothing. Almost every month, we shipping improvements or cheat features. We fixed several exploits upon discovery or disclosure within hours through hotfixes we do note publicly. EAC sometimes pushes several improvements weekly, which are applied when you start the. Our promise to you is we actively monitoring and combating cheaters daily. Our internal systems keep improving, as do EAC. Last year, we overdoubled our support to aid in support issues, which included matters. This year we dedicating more resources into anti cheat than ever and exploring some more radical measures. Old Content? We set aside multiple months in our internal roadmap of light or no content. These gaps are deliberate to allow us to be versatile and adaptive to community feedback, time to focus and address old content, and improve recent content. We have a lot we can keep building upon, not all content we add to is supposed to become meta, but rather adding yet another way of achieving a goal. At a quick glance, here are just some of the ahead Older monument reworks and improvements Continue experimenting and making meta to gunplay Softcore mode Improvements Hardcore mode experimenting Experimenting with progression Improvements to AI Improvements to events such as the patrol helicopter, Launch site APC and Cargoship World environment Underwater exploration Missions Using our data analytics to identify less commonly used items and balancing Experimenting with to encourage players to engage with PvP IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Ragdolls Improvements Several ragdolls improvements and fixes following last months Map Focus Hotkey Pressing F now focuses the players position when the map is open Scrolling Item Descriptions Long item descriptions now scroll TRUST IN TWITCH DROPS We excited to announce that hJune has teamed up with Rustoria again for the next Trust in tournament on Saturday, January.

        "content": "ANNIVERSARY This month marks birthday. We ll celebrate from today till the of December with birthday cake, hats, throwbacks and some items. has undergone significant evolution since its launch in. It initially began within the Unity Engine, playable in a web browser. Later, a standalone version launched on early access, the beginning of which is now known to most as Legacy. With rocky foundations, a complete overhaul was done to what we have today, known as reboot, or just nowadays. Over the past ten years, has sold over million copies not counting console. Legacy exceeded everyone expectations and has grown yearly for ten years. We have delivered monthly updates for ten years straight, as we continue to expand the development, we have no plans to stop providing you with guaranteed monthly updates. Reboot Below are some exciting metrics we achieved over the past years. If you interested in learning more about history, you can view the timeline here On behalf of everyone at Facepunch Studios, we to wish you a Happy Holidays. In the January blog, we discuss how has gone, what we achieved, what we learned, and our upcoming plans for. PINATA Take your best shot at the Pinata deployable, available to be crafted for wood. Destroying the Pinata will drop a random selection of goodies, remember to share with your teammates. CONFETTI CANNON Mark the occasion with the Confetti Cannon! Simply light the fuse and sit back while the confetti rains down. LEGACY WOOD SHELTER Remember those first few hours of Legacy? Farming resources for your first big base, and needing a place to call home in the meantime? The shelter was the answer. Now it back! The shelter comes with an included door, key lock and even a small radius of building privilege! The perfect start to your journey. Shelters will decay naturally, provided the door is interacted with by someone with a key or ownership of the shelter at least once a day. Make sure you keep using your shelter in order to keep it! Shelters placed within a tool cupboard radius will use TC upkeep as normal. They can be repaired with the hammer, the same as any other deployable. Hello! I Ian, the Gameplay Programmer! I remember cowering in my shelter back in. It incredible knowing I giving players the same experience I had back in the day by bringing Vincent awesome model to life. I ca wait to bring you more in the future. LEGACY BOW DLC The legacy bow is a only item which is only purchasable during the month of December. This bow skin pays homage to the bow model in. LEGACY WOOD BUILDING SKIN Available now from the is the Legacy Wood building skin, the first Wood building skin. Owning this skin will allow you to change the visuals of your wood tier base. This skin is for sale at the. To use, simply equip your hammer tool, display the wheel, and enable building skins. This should reveal the skin wheel on which you may choose Legacy Wood upgrade. SHOTGUN The shotgun was first introduced way back in Legacy in. To celebrate years of, we decided to revive it. The is an uncraftable shotgun unlike other shotguns, the has a much stronger range attack. The shotgun is a rare drop in loot crates. LEGACY FURNACE The Legacy Furnace is a free skin for the furnace based on the original model from. To earn the Legacy Furnace, simply for hours during the month of December. The furnace will be automatically issued to your Inventory to use! Fun Fact The original furnace was made of starter rocks copied and pasted together in the shape of a furnace. UPDATED PAINT UI The paint UI has been in need of an overhaul for a while and that what it got this! Not only does it look way better than before, it has a lot of features and improvements. features Eraser tool for all types of signs Colour picker tool Made the brush size and opacity options sliders instead of buttons a brush spacing option as a slider a more natural looking paint brush air brush types Button to reset the camera to face the object straight on Button to switch the preview lighting on or off removes glare at some angles Allow chatting while in the painting UI, with a button to hide it Bound to the save button a button to download the image currently being edited to your desktop Now have bindable convars for controlling the tool and brush options while painting lets you set the current tool as a number starting from, wrapping around at the end lets you set the current brush sets the brush size slider sets the brush spacing slider sets the brush opacity slider Note These function as convars so binds bind L will switch to the next tool Note You may need to the paint UI after adding a bind when the paint UI is open Improvements Fixed ugly UI, made it easier for us to maintain the three different types of paint UIs canvas scaler so UI is tiny at large resolutions Fixed gap visible between preview and right UI at some resolutions Clicks on top of UI will now never paint on the sign tooltips to all buttons so it is clear what they do Optimized painting implementation so long, quick strokes do kill framerate SHADOW INTENSITY POLISH The Contact Shadow option has been in the Experimental section for some years now. I believe the main reason for this is related to a very obvious of shadows. Foliage materials have a shadow intensity option that allows artists to control penumbra darkness, making it a bit more realistic. Contact Shadows, basically, ignore that parameter. Last month, I decided to over it and fix the problem, while tweaking and optimizing the effect in the process. It should now look a lot more seamless when toggling, respecting shadow intensity while still grounding the grass. HAPIS ISLAND Continuing with the theme of throwbacks to celebrate Birthday, you asked, we listened, Hapis Island is back again! This map version is and based on the version. If there thing the community does lack, it is passion. We plan to host Hapis Island until March. We hosting servers of Hapis Island across different regions. These can be found in the official server list by searching Hapis US EU IMPROVED RAGDOLL BEHAVIOUR ragdolls the floppy state a body enters after being killed have been revamped this month. They can now collide with all vehicles in the trains, cars, boats, helicopters etc, where previously they simply fell through. Issues with ragdolls stretching out unnaturally have been eliminated. If you ever saw a corpse where the interaction was lined up with the visible ragdoll, that fixed too. Old Behaviour When a died, a corpse entity used to spawn that was basically just a collider, which was physically simulated on the server. The position of that corpse would sync with every client. On the client side, a separate ragdoll object would spawn, that was a whole visible person with a full set of physically simulated limbs. That ragdoll was attached to the corpse basically by a tight spring. The corpse object controlled the actual loot interaction. Essentially the intention was Let the client do the work of simulating a whole body. We do care how their arms and legs are positioned, on the server. If it different between clients, do care. Keep the loot interaction consistent between clients by simulating just that part on the server. Keep the ragdoll and the corpse together with the spring. In reality, things were not perfect If a died somewhere the top of a wall, the corpse might fall down but not the ragdoll, or vice versa. Since the collision setup was quite different between corpse and ragdoll only the pelvis area matched this was relatively common. The result would be a mismatched position between corpse and ragdoll, sometimes putting the interaction in a strange place. The ragdoll joints did not working with the pelvis position data that was coming from the server. If movement was sudden, rather than just ending up in the wrong place, the ragdoll would sometimes stretch out unnaturally. If a ragdoll was on a moving vehicle, things were especially bad, to the point that we could enable ragdoll collision with vehicles at all. Things would happen a ragdoll dangling under a scrap heli because it had fallen out but the corpse had. This was exacerbated by the fact that the ragdoll physics simulation did work well with the fact that the vehicle was being moved on the server, rather than simulating on the client the ragdoll was. Although the physics did work, they acted the surface had zero friction, so the ragdoll would tend to slide around while the corpse wanted to stay put and the spring kept trying keep them together. Behaviour My first instinct for the simplest fix was to try just locking the ragdoll to the corpse, rather than using a spring. That would them to stay together. Unfortunately locking the pelvis to a position that was coming from the server, whilst simulating all the connected joints on the client, made the physics system very unhappy. Trying Unity tricks using versus, projection on or off, more solver iterations etc did help. The limbs would want to stay where they were while the pelvis pulled them around, and you just end up with a horrifying ragdoll instead of that was simply in the wrong place. Plus the limbs still had some of the old problems, the issue. The pelvis did always simulate well for a full body, since it did have any of the connected, so it try to places the full body did want to. The spring allowed for that kind of leeway, but a fixed connection did. So support was going to require either writing a custom physics solution for simulating the limbs on the client plus making something better for the pelvis simulation on the server side, or moving the whole ragdoll simulation to the server. Ultimately the custom physics solution was going to require most of the same work that a fully ragdoll was, on top of being difficult to code on my own in a way that came out superior to what Unity has already managed with employees. So ragdolls was the winner. The ragdolls work this A corpse spawns on the server, and that corpse is a fully simulated ragdoll with limbs etc. The base position of that corpse syncs to the client it did before, but now the limbs sync, in an efficient way that packed into a couple of integers. The client no longer has a ragdoll object that separate from the corpse. The corpse is the ragdoll, and it simulated only on the server. That basically eliminates all the problems at once, apart from the performance cost on the server of simulating more than it did before. To handle that, I made sure that ragdolls stop simulating as soon as they settled down, including when they on a moving vehicle. Overall the performance cost on the server is low, and behaviour is much improved. Reverting If anything does wrong, there is a console command that can be set true or false. It now true by default, but setting it to false will immediately revert to the old system. IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Industrial Pipe Colors teal, orange, pink purple Sprinkler Water Fix Fix sprinklers wasting up to of water or planters Fixed Tugboat FPS Tugboats were rarely causing a large FPS drop when coming into range Car Lift Pickup The car lift can now be picked up when not in use Hot Air Balloon Fixed Players falling out of the hot air balloon Heli Crate Remodel Updated patrol heli crate Fixed Explosive Ammo Splash In some situations, explosive ammo was not correctly applying splash damage Square Sun Did you ever notice the sun was square sometimes?

We noticed something strange though the monument was sometimes taking hours plural! to refresh. After looking into it we realized some players were staying on Oil Rig blocking the respawn for a number of reasons ranging from farming resources to siting afk in vents to grief the monument. Radiation will now appear on oil rig minutes after the hacked crate unlocks. It will apply low but consistent radiation regardless of what armor you are wearing forcing players to leave oil rig after the event is over. We resolved the issue of players leaving a single item inside the hacked crate to keep the crate map marker on the map when it was empty. To communicate this change with radiation there are multiple danger indicators when it starts Note that the alarm sound has changed what danger is signifies it has changed from heavy scientists incoming to radiation starting. These should ensure the Oil Rig event keeps refreshing you always have loot to fight over. END OF YEAR RETIREMENTS As the year ends, we look back at what has and has worked well, we have decided to make the following Hardcore Hardcore was in August, a mode aimed towards veteran players, with creature comforts such as safe zones, systems and maps disabled. Since its release, hardcore has seen a declining base, and we feel now is the right time to retire Hardcore from official servers. It was an exciting mode for us to experiment with, but we missed the mark on its implementation. We have collected a lot of community feedback for if and when we choose to revamp this gamemode in. Hardcore can still be enabled on community servers. Barren Barren was introduced as a map to cater for the system and before the introduction of custom maps. We made some advancements in performance since, regular community use of custom maps, and declined user base on Barren servers, we feel now is the right time to retire Barren. We think Barren looks ugly and not a good representation of. CHRISTMAS On December at EST, we be releasing an optional server and client to enable the Xmas event and some festive features!

While playing on servers with a world size of at least, you will find or rail tunnels allowing you to seamlessly travel between the underground and networks. To do it, simply take a train inside of the tunnels, drive it down a short slope and you will be inside the underground network. All wagon types are fully compatible with both networks regardless of their length allowing for gameplay opportunities. To top it off, we made some visual tweaks to the network that fix light leaking issues in small areas the stairwells, as well as made some other minor tweaks and fixes. UNDERGROUND TRAIN SIGNALS For a while now we had signal lights in the underground train tunnels, but they were always off. They now fully functional and can be used to see what up ahead. A green light means the block is clear. A red light means the block has something in it a train or a barricade. A yellow light means the next block has something in it, so you can get prepared. A block is the section between train signals. If there no next signal, it the rest of the track, either to the end of the line or the next if it further than that to the end of the line. WIRE TOOL RECONNECT Not only did we couple the rails this we allowed you to your wires! If you have done electrical before, you know the pain of unequipping a wire tool and having to the wire from the top to bottom of your base all over again. or yelling for a teammate to place a root combiner quickly! Short demonstration here. Note If a teammate blocks industrial with a wall as you have your wire tool holstered it will resume right before the industrial pipe is blocked. We the ability to reconnect existing wires to avoid rerunning them through the base. This speeds up redesigning circuits and will make reconnecting long wires significantly easier. Use right click to reconnect, hold right click to disconnect clear wire. ITEMS ON VEHICLES Dropped items no longer fall through vehicles. You can now drop items on trains, cars, boats, helicopters etc and they collide properly. Dropped items do have some mass, so they can weigh vehicles down a bit if there are a lot of them. But you can still fly a scrap heli load of stuff across the map. FRONTIER BASE DECOR PACK this month is the Frontier base decor pack DLC, a wild collection featuring ten items and variants.

Observer Island features custom mountains, bridges, train tunnels, unique monuments, arch rocks, a unique map layout, and manually sculpted cliff formations. The goal of this map is to encompass all the elements of vanilla while expanding upon them with features, making map exploration more engaging. It aims to refresh vanilla gameplay with building locations, unique map layout, and various other enhancements, including some secrets.

They might even lead to a secret It s worth mentioning that this is not Hapis.

To combat this we Turret Interference Basically this means that only a certain amount of turrets can be active in any particular area. subsequently activated turrets will emit a blue electrical glow and fail to acquire any targets. There is no hard limit on the number of turrets you can deploy, only a limit on the number of turrets to be activated at any time within. For example, you may choose to enable of your outdoor turrets but keep your indoor turrets disabled or you can set up smart circuits to detect players and power up turrets when needed. Hopefully this addresses some of the concerns we been hearing regarding this issue, and we plan to iterate and improve, we be watching the feedback. SMG BALANCE While SMGs are not intended to be used in long range engagements, some of the clips sent to us are a little out there. I reduced the aimcone on SMGs slightly so that more rounds will land in the center during sustained fire. I given the a bit of a buff, it deal slightly more damage and have less bullet drop.

Gunner The main special feature of this helicopter is the gunner seat. On the front is a turret similar to the deployable autoturret, where you can equip a gun and ammo. At the side pods, rockets can be loaded in HV and incendiary type only. The gunner can then aim and shoot both of these while a pilot flies the heli. Simply interact with the gunner monitor and start blasting! will shoot the turret and launches rockets. If the gunner has flares ready in his or her inventory belt, those can be held and manually thrown to deflect any oncoming homing rockets from the homing rocket launcher this is a feature for passengers in all helicopter types, not just the attack helicopter. Pilot The pilot is the driver, but can fire rockets left mouse button by default, albeit without the handy guide that the gunner gets. Standard flares can be loaded into the rocket storage area along with rockets, and the pilot can fire them out right mouse button. The attack helicopter is fast and powerful when armed, but it was still be taken down with a rocket. HOMING MISSILE LAUNCHER The Homing Missile Launcher is a craftable addition to your armoury that allows you to more efficiently fight flying targets while out and about. To get started simply load a Homing Missile into the Launcher and start aiming at a flying target. You ll notice a bar will start filling in. Once locked on you can fire, but be sure to keep aiming at the target or the missile will fly off course. Changing weapon or reloading will disrupt the targeting. From a pilot perspective, there are a few tools at your disposal to evade these threats. You will hear a warning lock audio indicator in every helicopter when a missile is fired at you. The simplest tactic is just taking evasive manoeuvres the missile lock requires a direct line of sight so getting something solid between you and the launcher should keep you safe. If that s not possible, flares are your next best bet. Any passenger can throw Flares to disrupt any incoming missiles. The Attack Helicopter has a dedicated Flare button that can launch flares via the secondary attack button RMB by default. The NPC piloted Patrol Helicopter has been upgraded with Flare functionality, it will automatically fire Flares when a missile is launched at it. The Homing Missile Launcher requires a Workbench Level and can be crafted for HQM, Metal Pipes, Tech Trash and CCTV Camera. Homing Missiles require a Workbench Level, and missiles can be crafted for Metal Pipes, Gun Powder and Tech Trash. PARACHUTES The parachute is a craftable item that allows you to slow your fall from great heights, as well as travel silently over long distances. Once you ve acquired, you will need to equip it in the dedicated backpack slot on your character s clothing bar. Once equipped you ll be able to press Space while falling through the air to deploy the parachute, slowing your descent and allowing you to manoeuvre your way through the sky. Your movement keys can help you manoeuvre while in, allowing you to tilt forwards to fly faster, back to slow down and left and right to turn. You can use weapons while flying, but doing so will prevent you from steering. Simply holster your weapon again to regain steering controls. Your flight can end either via you hitting something solid or cutting your lines with the Dismount key. After your flight an unpacked version of the parachute will drop in front of you, to use the parachute again you ll need to hold the pickup key for seconds to pick it up again. Each use will lower the condition of your parachute by and a parachute will become harder to control as it loses condition. A damaged parachute will fall faster and fly forwards slower. At extreme damage levels you could still take fall damage when landing the parachute. If you hit something solid you can take damage based on your speed, up to at top speeds. The additional slot in your inventory has been to the locker interface so you can parachutes with loadout kits. Parachutes are a special type of clothing that can be equipped alongside clothing Hazmats. Parachutes can be targeted by SAM sites, Auto Turrets and players on the ground while in. You can craft Parachutes at a Tier Workbench for Tarps, Sewing Kits and Cloth. ARMORED HOT HAIR BALLOON The hot air balloon can now be upgraded with a armor upgrade. Equipping the armor will boost the overall health of the balloon whilst providing additional cover and protection. The armor upgrade can be purchased at the Bandit Camp vehicle parts vendor. NETWORKED BASES You normally only see bases away. Get ready this feature cranks up the view distance of structures up to away! In the past, SAM sites could appear out of nowhere, only becoming visible after the missiles are headed your way. You should now be able to spot SAM sites enemy bases long before you come in range! This does just benefit you in the air. While on the ground you can scout roof camping towers big bases before you are in danger. You will notice the world feels much alive with evidence of activity all around you. I know you thinking Wo this cause performance issues?. Well, turns out the rendering system is significantly more efficient than unity normal. The majority of computation is on the GPU which allows us to keep performance parity while rendering the amount of bases. This sets the stage for additional performance improvements in the future. This feature is currently disabled by default as it required a lot of. Look for Rendering in the option menu to enable it. WEAPON RACKS The Weapons Rack Pack is now available from the item. Weapon racks introduce a quick, versatile and functional weapon and tool storage solution. With a Weapon Rack, you can efficiently organize, and display your tools and weapons a true survivor. The weapons rack pack lets the craft three different sized weapon racks and a single floor storage solution. If you missed last month community blog, check out the weapons rack. IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Pumpjack Quarry Pumpjack Quarry model have received a refresh Hot Air Balloon Fuel The Hot Air Balloon now uses slightly less fuel Furnace Skin Glow Furance glow was broken, it now fixed and improved Fluid Switch Pump The Fluid switch and Pump now stack in the inventory blueprints Improved UI to clearly feedback certain blueprints that can not be learnt Hot Air Balloon Decay When hot air balloons become stuck, they decay much faster END OF THE WORLD When players drove vehicles to the edges of the world and went out of bounds, we killed the and vehicles, This was great as we gave no feedback for when this was about to happen. Now vehicles are unable to leave the map bounds we now apply a on the, making it impossible to escape. Additionally, boats, if left for hours, will begin to be forced back to shore gradually.

In its vanilla form, is a gritty Darwinian sandbox in which you must scavenge to stay alive, developing your equipment from sticks and bows to machine guns, keeping it all safe in bases of wood and rusty metal while other players seek to take it all from you. But as these servers amply demonstrate, it can be so much more than that. By tweaking all these particulars or adding ones through mods and custom content, creative players host that focus on the PvP aspects, or the building systems in a more peaceful environment, or create entirely minigames with more restrictive but wildly inventive rule sets, and we found them all.

        "content": "SLEEPING BAG LIMITS This month we ve decided to limit the maximum number of respawn options to per. This is a big change and not we make lightly, so we thought it would be a good idea to explain our thinking. While this is an inconvenience to certain playstyles, we believe adapting to this change will lead to a healthier and more interesting. Back in October we revised the death screen, unintentionally making it trivial to manage a large number of bags. This led to situations where players could respawn rapidly and rejoin fights in ways that work against the goal of death being meaningful in. Ultimately we want placing respawn points to be an interesting decision rather than something done as often as possible. We explored alternatives such as adjusting the respawn radius on bags or grid based approaches. Unfortunately this was simple to bypass and too complicated to communicate to players. Increasing the cost of wouldn t have solved the issue as large groups could easily overcome any additional resource requirements. To help manage respawn options we have made them visible on the map while alive. We the ability to unclaim bags you are using anymore. There is a toggle on the right side of the map below the layer controls to hide bags while alive. There are multiple ways to see how many you have placed a count on the icon as well as a notification after you place a. To prevent malicious behavior such as gifting bags to other players and filling up their quota you will find a Bag Gifting option in the options menu. This will allow you to limit who can assign a bag to you. The choices are Anyone default option teammates friendly in contact system Disabled nobody allowed Server owners can change the maximum bags per server with the convar. If you would to disable it for your server, set it to. We will keep an eye on this change over the coming months and make as required. BUILD UPGRADE EFFECT To say that our building upgrade effect was dated would be an understatement. I do think it has been adjusted since its inception. I taken some time to improve the effect, and bring it in to this decade. When you upgrade a building block, you will see it constructed piece by piece over the course of second. Short demonstration here. Keep in mind that this is a effect and the upgrade still happens immediately on the server. You can disable this effect in the options menu. In the future, we may expand this effect into a feature, so that very large deployables, such as watchtowers do just appear in frame but rather will need to be built over time. IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Handmade Shotgun Ammo handmade shotgun ammo world model Vending Machine Debris Vending Machines now drop debris when destroyed, preventing replacement Pylon Fixes Fixed floaty pylon placement edge cases Building Skin Repair Fixed building block getting fully repaired when switching building skin Streamer Mode Skulls Harvested skulls in streamer mode now display streamer names Sign Resolution Increased Wooden signs banners now have same resolution as paintings SHIPPING CONTAINER BUILDING SKIN If you ever wanted to know what it to build a home out of refurbished containers, wait no more! Coming to you this month is a building block skin with the appearance of shipping containers and some and unique features alongside it. When you first build using the skin, the initial color of the container blocks are randomized. They come in different colors here is a lookup chart of the available colors If you wish to change the look of your crib, you can now use the spray can alternate function RMB to display a selection wheel of the available colors and repaint your walls. It worth noting that the last color you with will now be the building blocks color used when you build additional shipping container blocks. We look forward to see how creative you get with this skin! HAMMER RADIAL MENU IMPROVEMENTS We listened to your feedback regarding the hammer radial menu when changing building block skins and have made some significant improvements. You can now switch between building skins with Q and E can be configured in the options menu while hovering over the various building tier buttons. MAP MARKER IMPROVEMENTS We ve made some improvements to the map marker system based on your feedback from their improvements in the April. You ll now notice a list of the current markers on the top left of the map screen. Clicking on these will move the map to that marker and you can delete the marker from that UI without having to move your camera, this should be helpful if you need to clear a marker quickly to place a marker. The marker labels can now show an extra character on the compass, the visibility of the marker labels has been improved when placed over snow, you can now hide your leaders markers on the map and compass via the top left menu as well as several bug fixes. PING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS Pings have seen a set of improvements based on community feedback. area that was flagged was being notified when a teammate has placed a ping out of your view. To help this, each ping type now has a unique sound effect and the compass will flash briefly to indicate where the ping has been placed. General usability has been improved pings can now be placed immediately when the binoculars are equipped don t need to zoom in and binoculars now have a crosshair for more precise placement. Pings can now be deleted regardless of what you are holding in your hands. Finally, the ping UI itself has been scaled up slightly and pings now fade out once they time out instead of being deleted immediately. MEMORY POOL THREAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS We improved the way our internal memory pool handles thread safety. This should not result in any immediate, but it allows us to ensure we wo introduce resource contention performance issues as our multithreading scales up, particularly around networking and serialization. If you a server owner and you notice a performance decrease from this change, please let us know. QUERY PORT CONNECT Players can now connect to a server using both the port and the query port. This fixes link issues that were introduced back when we started enforcing separate query ports on servers. If you a server owner and you want to use links on your website, please make sure to use the query port in those links, not the port. HORSE IDLES For a while now we just had long idle. It pretty repetitive if you sitting on top of a horse, you end up just getting shook around every seconds. I wanted to see more variation. There is now a short base breathe anim, and lots of small idles that randomly after a few seconds or so. There are larger actions a shake of the body or head toss as well as smaller ones a tail swish or ear flick. The result hopefully looking more natural in. WIPE TIMER IMPROVEMENTS For server owners I updated the logic for the server wipe timer to support timezones properly. The default configuration aligns with wipes so it should need any changing for most people. Make sure the time is set correctly on your servers! Monthly First Thursday every month at London time Weekly Every Thursday at London time Biweekly First and third Thursday of each month at London time, but splits week gaps into weeks for months with weeks Internally it is now using cron expressions using the Cronos library. If you, you can use a custom cron expression for your wipe timer by setting the wipeCronOverride convar. You can use a different timezone for wipes by setting the wipeTimezone convar to an IANA timezone name see TZ identifiers on this page. There is now a printWipe console command which shows debug info about upcoming wipes which can help you set up your configurations correctly.

        "content": "NUCLEAR MISSILE SILO This month we bring you an monument that we have been quietly working on for the past few months, the Nuclear Missile Silo. While exploring the map you will run across a small military base that will be marked from the distance by a tall radio tower. While unremarkable from the outside, the base hides a secret. In its center you will find a large hatch that will allow you to access a large underground network of tunnels. Jump in while the hatch is open and you will find yourself inside a deep underground missile silo that hosts a massive ICMB. Remember that while you in you ca back easily, so be prepared before you enter. As you explore, you will find various rooms filled with loot and a dangerous type of Scientists who will shoot anyone trying to interfere with their experiments. Fight your way through and take the elevators to the bottom of the structure and you will find a nuclear warhead connected to a laptop displaying an ominous countdown. To exit the monument you will need to find a security room that contains a button that will temporarily let you out. The room contains a computer station that will allow you to access several security cameras and spy on any potential campers. WIPE EVENT As the countdown to the cycle reset approaches zero on the laptop in the missile silo, the amount of NPC activity around the island will increase. Vehicle patrols will begin on roads and fighter jets will patrol the skies. Future wipe events will include infantry patrols and bombing runs. SMG RECOIL The Thompson and have received a buff to their accuracy. Both weapons will now have a higher probability to land center hits during extended fully automatic fire. In addition, the Thompson recoil will favor side for slightly easier control. While SMGs are not intended to be used for long range engagements, we are aware that their usefulness at range should not be. We will continue to monitor and make adjustments over the following few months. ADOBE BUILDING SKIN Available now from the is the Adobe building skin which allows you to change the visuals of your base. This skin is for sale on the. To use, simply equip your hammer tool, display the wheel, enable building skins, this should reveal the skin wheel on which you may choose Adobe style upgrade. This skin is equivalent to the stone building tier for stats. We be releasing more building skins in the near future. LATEST WORLD MODELS To complement the shotgun ammo world models in the last. I have been busy making the metal counterparts for the pistol and rifle ammo world models. Alongside the world models, I have made different versions for the different ammo types. So now you will be able to tell the difference between normal and explosive ammo. So now no more losing the raid because you picked up pistol ammo instead of rifle ammo! IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS FLASHBANG AI Flashbangs now work against Scientists, blinding them briefly. Whilst blinded, Scientists lose their targets and are unable to accurately navigate. The effect is slightly more effective against the Night Vision Goggle Scientist variant. RECYCLER The recycler now animates when in operation, so you can visually see when it doing it thing. GAMEPLAY ANALYTICS MONTH IN Despite some speed bumps while setting it up a smidge of incorrect data, we already are able to make some interesting observations. Here are some graphs to showcase the kind of things we can measure. If you were wondering what do people buy workbenches for How aks are born Total items across FP servers The camera view in got some rendering improvements. Players no longer look completely out of place and everything is now lit according to the time of day. However, other lights campfires, torches, etc. will not show up yet. I adjusted the ranges for players to show up in the CCTV feeds so players need to be closer to cameras to be seen in now theoretically. I a range for the name to be sent to so you ca see names of players far away now or closer. These are controlled by the following server convars for general entities, which is just trees for now default, can set to to never show players default, can set to to never show names bots have been getting out of control so we decided to implement a few to make them less effective. Disallowed from viewing all static CCTV cameras eg. oil rigs Crate and explosion map markers are no longer sent to Cameras are only usable from when you are connected to the server data is now randomized by the server to make it harder for bots to understand names are only sent to when close enough to the cameras We be monitoring further Bot development. Automation of input actions must be kept to a minimum using. Extensive automation of actions such as CCTV cameras and Drones to gain an unfair advantage is not TWITCH III TWITCH DROPS On May at pm GMT a of Twitch creators from around the world will compete in this massive competition, taking place over days with a prize pool worth.

Placing more markers is as simple as using the RMB as normal, and markers are deleted in the same way. If you have reached the maximum number of markers by default you will need to delete another marker to make room. To edit a marker simply click on it with the LMB and use the controls that pop up. You can select from multiple colour and icons as well as adding a label. Note that the label will be slimmed down to three characters when displayed on the compass. If you are the leader of a all of your teammates will see all of your markers, as well as their own. PINGS Pings are a system to help you more effectively communicate to your teammates when using reconnaissance tools cameras, drones and the binoculars. While using any of those items and holding down RMB when using the binoculars you can double tap KEYBIND to pop down a ping. All of your teammates will see this ping, even if you are not the leader. Single tapping the ping key will place a contextual ping when possible, for example placing a node ping when aiming at a node, a loot ping when aiming at a storage entity or a gun ping when aiming at a dropped weapon. Double pressing the ping key will place a red hostile ping, designed to represent danger. You can hold the ping key down to access a radial menu with all of the ping options in case you need more flexibility. Single tapping while looking at a ping will cancel it, otherwise the ping will expire in seconds. DOUBLE HORSE SADDLE The double saddle item lets players mount and ride a horse. This is in addition to the old single seater saddle, so the choice is yours! Wild horses spawn with a single seater saddle and you can swap it for a double seater via the horse radial menu, if you have the required saddle item and the other way around!. Both saddle items are available for purchase from the stablemaster or via crafting. WORLD MODEL REFRESH The refresh for the world models has finally arrived. Finally, you will be able to tell if you have dropped HV, Incendiary, or Normal Rockets! Alongside the world model refresh world models have been created for the different types of shotgun shells. Some of the items that have had a world model refresh are Road Sign Gloves Snap Trap Rocket Incendiary Rocket Shotgun Ammo Hopefully, soon there wo be any more brown burlap sacks on the island! COMPUTER STATION UI I made a few improvements to the computer station UI this month. You can now use arrow keys or mouse wheel to switch between selected entities. The UI will now show the health of the entity you currently controlling. We have an existing console variable vehicleDismountHoldTime that can be set to a value above zero to enable on vehicles. This is now used if you a drone at the computer station. Setting it even to something small seconds can be a simple way to avoid accidentally dismounting and crashing your drone. IMPROVEMENTS FIXES HIGHLIGHTS to ignore loot inventory items to ignore loot containers Computer station UI Health bar, key controls, Floating Single Items When subs and boats are destroyed, storage drops single items in a floating container Vending Machine Genetics Vending machine and marketplace now display plant genetics Nickname Fix UI will use nicknames GAMEPLAY ANALYTICS This month we extend our analytics platform by recording gameplay stats on official servers. There was actually an existing analytics system in place but it only showed totals for the whole such as stone mined per day. That does tell us much, we are looking for more detailed info max sulfur per hour you can mine number of players gathering the same nodes in forest vs snow how quickly you get into fights while farming based on base location how far players travel to farm etc We are still in the stage of rolling it out so we do have many pictures to show off. PLACE DOORS ON DEPLOYABLES A couple months back I made a commit to see if doors could be placed on top of deployables, which caused a bit too much excitement. It needed some extra fixes but now should work! CPU AFFINITY, PRIORITY FIX After upgrading to a I realized you ca change CPU affinity when EAC is running. I some commands so anyone can change their core affinity process priority. You can specify multiple ranges of cores, Everyone should try using high and see if it makes any difference. If you have a, try using to keep running only on cores. You can add these as launch parameters too high MULTITHREADED NETWORKING Multithreaded networking is now enabled by default for both client and server. This should help with performance of both the client and the server, particularly with network encryption enabled, which should be the case on most servers. As an additional optimization, we improved the way our memory pool handled contention between multiple threads to ensure there are no negative performance edge cases from all those additional threads. Earlier last month, we addressed an issue where thread was spinning at utilization at essentially all times with multithreaded networking enabled. Since this was resolved, there are now no known issues and we recommend all server owners to leave multithreaded networking enabled. SAFE MODE It now possible to launch or reset into safe mode a basic, extremely low quality settings config to help diagnose problems. You can use safemode with a button in the Options menu or by passing the command in the launch settings. You should only use this feature if you are advised by our Support or are experiencing problems with launching the.

Can be picked up and deployed just about anywhere but it does have the best signal, so you need to control it using nearby Computer Station. The Drone can be unlocked from the tier workbench tech tree. RF DETONATED can now be remotely detonated via RF. Select the item and click enable RF, then set a frequency. An RF Broadcaster or detonator can then be set to the same frequency and as soon as the detects the signal, BOOM. Please note that deployed outside of your building privilege zone will decay after hours., anyone can pick it up with a second delay so keep a look out when using it during raids. Use it to set traps in your own base or for controlled demolition of someone else. There has never been a better time to bankrupt a clan! PTZ SECURITY CAMERA A CCTV Camera system can be used for surveillance and security when paired with the Computer Station. This camera has pan, tilt, and zoom capability and must be placed on a ceiling. All cameras now require power instead of. The PTZ camera can be unlocked from the workbench level tech tree. CONTROLLED AUTO TURRET Autoturrets can now be configured to be pairable with a Computer Station. While the autoturret is turned off, there is a menu to set the ID which you can then add in your Computer Station. When connected to an autoturret from a Computer Station you will take control of it so you can look around and even shoot at things. However, the camera on the autoturrets do have a great view of far away objects. The autoturret can not be controlled whilst in peacekeeper mode. CCTV IN Something that has constantly been requested in is the ability to view cameras. I tried a few different solutions to get that working but had nothing that worked good enough until recently. You now be able to add cameras from a paired server in and view them from your phone! This is an alpha release of the feature. I be working on improvements over time but, if there are any issues found, it may be disabled or limited to preserve server stability. Server owners can control this feature using the set of convars. Video Example Here The signal from your cameras has got to travel a long way to get to your phone so everything is low quality but you should be able to make out most things in the world. All of the, controllable cameras can be used from! You will need to make sure you have the very latest version of from the App or Google. You will need native version as seen in the settings. This version of the app is currently in the process of being so you may need to wait a bit if no updates are available on your device yet. INDUSTRIAL IMPROVEMENTS It was great to see the response to the Industrial last month, particularly the bases filled to the brim with pipes! As well as some general bug fixes and performance improvements, we ve made some QOL improvements this month to help with some of the more common complaints. As always we ll be improving this further in the future so please keep the feedback coming. Filtering Options There is now a option when modifying filters to allow more advanced controls. You can now change a filter to require ANY of the listed items, ALL of the listed items, or NONE of the listed items. The default is Any, which is the behaviour from last month. There have been some to the number based filters, there are now different number fields you can modify per item Min, Max and Buffer. Maximum is unchanged from last month, it will stop moving items if there is greater than the amount provided in the output container. Minimum will now only move if you have greater than the supplied amount of items in the input container. For example, if you set minimum to wood and you have wood in the container, will be moved. Buffer is the old minimum behaviour, and will only move items in predetermined buffer sizes. For example, if you set Buffer to wood and you have wood in the container, will be moved. This is helpful when supplying the Industrial Crafter with items required for crafting. Minimum, Maximum and Buffer are only available when using Any and All filter modes, these options are not available when using the None filter mode. To help understand buffer transfers there is a UI that shows any transfers in process. Placement Improvements The minimum distance between pipe points is now dramatically smaller, allowing for neater pipe placement around corners. There s a colour available green and soloing a connection by pressing RMB while looking at a plug will now keep the connection highlighted even if mousing over other entities. You can now hold SHIFT when placing a pipe to make it collide with deployable entities, this can help run pipes around boxes and other objects in a more natural looking way. Crafter Improvements The Industrial Crafter now has blueprint slots, allowing you to craft multiple items without having to connect conveyors to the blueprint slots although those connections are still possible. When a crafter is deciding what to craft, it will look left to right and craft the first blueprint it has the required ingredients for. Network Size Limits The maximum size and depth of Industrial networks has been increased to from. This should allow more complex networks without having to resort to inserting extra containers. Along with this the behaviour of some item movement logic has changed daisy chained boxes will now be filled in order rather than items being split up between them the splitter will still split stacks though. VENDING MACHINE LOOT When the vending machine is destroyed, it drops no loot. This was too incentivise players to sell items and discourage raiding stores. Over the years vending machines have undergone many, such as drone trading via the market terminal. We seen players use vending machines to despawn loot in various methods and act as additional base armour. From today, when the vending machine is destroyed, it now drop of the loot stored inside. MULTITHREADED NETWORKING RELEASE SCHEDULE We have spent the month thoroughly testing and fixing multithreaded networking and are happy to report that as of the writing of this post all known issues with it have been addressed. In order to it extra safe we will continue testing it on official servers over the coming days and then release a server to enable it by default for all servers. As a reminder, if you a server owner, feel free to test things ahead of time by adding the startup parameter to your server. Simultaneously, we will continue testing it on the client internally and then enable it for all clients by default next week. ADDITIONAL CHANGE LOG Improvements Reduced minimum gap between pipe points Can hold Shift to place entities on top of other deployed entities Reworked Maximum and Minimum filter behaviour and a Buffer mode more blueprint slots to the Industrial Crafter Improved pipe generation performance and fixed pipes being regenerated too often a green pipe colour an extra slot for storage adaptors on the front of small boxes Electric Furnace and Storage Adaptor performance improvements Buffer transfers will now be cancelled if a conveyor is turned off or runs out of the item a UI visualisation to show what buffer transfers are in process Conveyors will now turn back on when they receive power if they were on when they lost power Reduced volume of Industrial sounds Industrial Crafter will now only make noise when it is crafting Industrial Crafter will now pulse red if it s output storage is full Various server garbage collection improvements Fixes Looking at another entity while an IO connection is solo d will now maintain the solo visualisation Fixed being able to place storage adaptors in places where they would intersect with other colliders eg. top of a small box placed under a workbench Fixed some cases where blueprints would respect number based item filters Fixed sometimes being unable to build in areas where pipes used to be Ziplines should now be much less likely to kill the if they collide with the terrain Ziplines should now use alternate paths more often if the terrain is too close to the desired zipline Fixed some cases where the Repair resources required UI wouldn t appear when attempting to repair an entity Fixed contacts button staying disabled permanently after connecting to a server with contacts disabled Fixed water catchers no longer filling up with water when connected to a full water container Fixed edge case where underground train tunnel entrance would not connect to underground train station Various fixes for multithreaded networking",

        "content": "INDUSTRIAL Bring levels of efficiency and unlock avenues for automation with this month set of Industrial entities. With these tools you can move items around your base as well as craft items automatically without you needing to lift a finger. Storage Adaptor The Storage Adaptor is the starting point for most of your Industrial plans simply attach an adaptor to an existing storage entity to make that entity compatible with your Industrial systems. The adaptor does not require power. Some entities have more than slot that a storage adaptor can be attached to for ease of placement. Typically the storage adaptor can use all inventory slots on it attached storage for, although there are some exceptions When attached to a furnace the Input will insert items into the item slots while the output will remove items from the output slots When attached to a locker the storage adaptor will only access partition, to access all partitions you need to place three storage adaptors The storage adaptor is compatible with Tool Cupboard Large Wooden Box Small Wooden Box Small Furnace Large Furnace Refinery Electric Furnace Locker Fridge Drop box Vending Machine Industrial Conveyor The Conveyor is responsible for moving items from entity to another, generally via Storage Adaptors. Once powered and turned on the conveyor will look for items in containers connected to its inputs and then divide those items amongst its outputs. By default a Conveyor will move any item it can find, but you can assign a filter to have more precise control over exactly what items you moving. Each Conveyor filter can have up to items or categories. When a filter is assigned the Conveyor will only transfer items that pass those conditions. You can assign values to each item in a filter to control quantities, by setting the Maximum amount do send resources if the target container has over of that resource already and Minimum amount only send resources in a minimum batch of size. You find a Filter Pass and Filter Fail electrical passthrough, these will activate based on the current state of the conveyor allowing you to control other parts of the Industrial network based on what items are being moved around. Pipe Tool The Pipe Tool is how you connect industrial entities if you used the Wire or Hose tool before you be right at home. Pipes come in colours to help identify what going where. Same distance rules apply here except that the anchor points need to be a small distance apart from another and that pipes can not through building blocks or Vending Machines. They can through deployables doors. Industrial These work as you expect, allowing you to funnel or split the flow of items. In the case of a splitter connected to the output of a Conveyor, the Conveyor will spread its resources across all of its connections eg. a Conveyor connected to a splitter which connects to three boxes that wants to send wood will send wood to each box. Industrial Crafter Once attached to a workbench any tier the Industrial Crafter allows you to automatically craft items once provided with a blueprint and the required materials. Simply insert the blueprint of your choice in the blueprint slot, insert the required materials, connect some power and turn it on to start producing items. The Industrial Crafter has built in Industrial slots so no need for an adaptor so that you can use Conveyors to insert materials and then extract the finished result. There is a Blueprint Industrial slot allowing you to swap out the blueprint being crafted. The Crafter can only craft items that are appropriate for the workbench it attached to and will take the same amount of time to craft an item as a would. Electric Furnace To complement the Industrial items we releasing the Electric Furnace. It works similarly to other furnaces with a slightly accelerated smelting rate except that it requires power instead of a fuel item. This means that it does produce charcoal. Limitations and Server options To maintain server performance there are several limitations to prevent Industrial networks from becoming too out of control. There is a hardcoded container limit for each conveyor. This means that as well as the max depth limitation of regular IO, a conveyor will only be able to see the first containers it encounters in the network. There is a hardcoded limit on how many items in a stack a Conveyor can move in a single tick. If a stack has a count higher than this it will be moved gradually over several ticks. There are several convars to control the speed and efficiency of industrial systems How often conveyors attempt a move default How often crafters attempt to craft something default How many whole stacks a conveyor can move in a single tick default CODELOCK DEFAULT OPTIONS Previously doors would show Open as the default option whether you had the code or not, requiring you to randomly stumble upon doors you could open, beeping in your face then requiring you to holding E to bring up radial menu and select unlock. The default options are as follows first placed change code to quickly set your code unauthorized on codelock auth on TC enter code authorized on codelock unlocked door lock door to prevent leaving doors unlocked This should allow you to see at a glance what you still need to enter a code on open the codelock UI much easier. TRAIN WAGON LOOT Train wagons containing crates now have different variants of varying qualities. Overall should be seeing wagons with much loot from crates. CLIENT PERFORMANCE METRICS Performance is always a hot topic but it is difficult to address without having an accurate image of the problem. This month I setup logging of client performance and displayed them in various graphs. This has already proven to be useful. We noticed that exclusive fullscreen had lower FPS than borderless. Rather than guessing, we were able to query the database and confirm it. See below for various graphs to get an idea of the insights we are seeing some interesting data. Overall FPS First up is median FPS across all hardware. It does give a full picture players with monitors are included beside gamers. A better metric may be comparing average fps to monitor refresh rate to see how many players are getting lower FPS than their monitor supports something we will look at in the future. Best Performing Hardware These charts clearly shows how is CPU bottlenecked no surprise. What is interesting is how much the extra cache does a is on average faster than a! Please do use this as an excuse to buy a better CPU as performance is subject to change but do use this info so you avoid buying a GPU for then being surprised when it yields no performance improvement at this time. Hardware Capacity of the playerbase is running or less of RAM perhaps we should prioritize why Unity is hogging all the RAM. The majority of players using yet only of players using?! Popular Hardware Looking at most popular CPU GPU we find that it is similar to hardware survey but differs slightly as for. Here are some GPUs as of total Our Metrics GTX GTX GTX RTX RTX RTX Graphics settings of people using motion blur only of players using SMAA, of players using primarily windowed mode not borderless all interesting. I thought more players would have turned shadows off. Operating System Our Mac playerbase is very small, only of players. Yet even stranger are the people still on Windows laptops perhaps? Future Next steps are to expand to gameplay metrics. Technically we already have some gameplay stats but they are very limited total wood gathered, total kills, etc. Better gameplay metrics will give us the ability to drill down to specific information such as most popular weapon each day of a wipe win ratio of different weapon deaths per size of hourly loot per monuments least used items WATER IO SERVER IMPROVEMENTS We been aware of some server performance degradation with large scale farms and Water Catcher networks for a while and we made some improvements this month to hopefully improve the situation. The primary performance issue at here is the amount of processing required when an entity in an IO chain switches on or off. Under normal circumstances this does happen that often but water containers are considered On when they have water and Off when they are empty. When a chain of Water Catchers are connected and sending water down a chain each container will turn on when it receives the water and then turn off as it passes the water to its next container. Water transferring is quite quick and responsive, this results in rapid sequences of entities turning on and off repeatedly which sends a lot of network updates to any clients in range and involves a lot of largely useless IO processing as the network state so rapidly. To solve these issues water will now take seconds to start draining once it inserted into a container. This means that when water travels through multiple containers each container in the sequence will build up a buffer usually water in each container. This allows the same water flow as before but mostly prevents the containers rapidly turning. The result is that a small sequence of full barrels connected to each other powering a sprinkler used to be sending network updates every few seconds will no longer send any updates at all while the system is active, only a few updates when the system runs out of water. This should improve performance primarily on the server but receiving less network traffic will help client performance as well. We modified the behaviour of Water Catchers, when a Water Catcher is going to generate some water, it will now deposit its water as far down the chain as possible. This means that if you have Water Catchers connected to a Water Barrel, the catchers will actually never receive water at all, instead the water will be deposited directly into the barrel. In a benchmark of water catchers connected to each other, we found that the server IO would become unresponsive after several minutes of gameplay as the system became overloaded with water transfer processing. With the above server IO performance remains instantaneous even if we artificially limit the servers frame rate. There is a optional server convar that modifies the draining behaviour to leave unit of water behind in a liquid container that drains into another container. This keeps the container in its On state permanently and further helps performance. Since this is a change in functionality it is disabled by default, if your server is still experiencing IO performance issues due to water entities turning this on may improve performance. HAPIS RETIREMENT Today we permanently retiring Hapis Island map. Hapis Island was first introduced in April by Petur, inspired by the original legacy map. Over the years, Hapis has gone through countless revisions to where it is at today. Why Retire Hapis? We a small development with no dedicated staff focusing on map design and creation, our mapping attention is focused on procedural maps. Hapis has continuously been developed on the sidelines as a project with any free time Petur has. Free time is harder to find nowadays as we focus more on larger, features with a higher level of polish. Hapis Island needs a lot of attention requiring hundreds of work hours to be polished and kept fresh, which we ca currently give it. Hapis Island is missing many key features we over the past couple of years, zip lines, subways, monuments and rail systems, to name a few. When Hapis can support newer features it often takes an extra month, or few for the features to be introduced to Hapis, leaving players waiting and disappointed, some features, such as the rail systems Hapis ca currently support due to a lack of internal tools. This is the end for static maps on Facepunch servers, we be working with the custom map community to fill this void over the coming weeks and months. UNITY UPGRADE We have upgraded the client engine to Unity version earlier this month. Initially there have been a number of issues from the upgrade, but we gone through and addressed all the major ones with several small patches. This version of Unity should open up possibilities for both performance and visual improvements that we hoping to introduce over the coming months. A big is Unity Burst compiler that will help us transition existing code in the Jobs system to a higher performance version of it. Unfortunately the upgrade introduced a bug in fullscreen exclusive mode that caused a significant performance degradation compared to borderless fullscreen mode. Due to this we had to retire fullscreen exclusive mode. If you encountering issues that seem related to this, please contact our support to figure out a workaround for your specific setup. The server build of the will remain on for this month while we continue testing the engine version to make sure the server build is stable enough for a wide release. More on that hopefully next month. MULTITHREADED NETWORK TESTING We been working on a major networking performance improvement called multithreaded networking. This will apply to both the client and the server, but naturally it will have a significantly higher impact on the server. Due to the nature of the change we wanted to make sure it working as intended before enabling it by default, so we first going to start testing it on select official servers this month before hopefully enabling it by default on all servers next month. If you want to start testing it before then, simply add the startup parameter to your server or client. Please note that this is a highly experimental feature that may cause significant problems when enabled. SERVER QUERY PORT SHARING RETIREMENT As announced in the November and December devblogs, we are working on a number of networking improvements that require us to retire server query port sharing. Because of this, we have requested that all server owners that are still using this feature their server startup parameters to use a query port that is separate from the port. We have decided to pull the trigger and finally retire query port sharing this month. If you a server owner who still has updated their server startup parameters, please make sure to do so immediately.",

In the January end of years blog, we talk more about how has gone, what we achieved and what we learned as well as our upcoming plans. MODULAR CAR CODE LOCKS Car keys have been from the and replaced with code locks, which should be a lot more useful. These can be at a vehicle lift in the same way key locks were, and for the same price metal fragments. Features Add, change, or remove code locks from a car at any vehicle lift. Code locks prevent mounting the vehicle except for taxi modules and prevent access to storage. Players in a taxi module can not swap seats to any other type of module. To capture a car with code locks, you can reduce the health of a seating module to or less, which will enable an option to break the lock. Alternatively, if you can push the car to a vehicle lift, a code can be set there. Note that locked cars can not be pushed in safe zones. A mounted can flip the Central Locking switch in a cockpit module to unlock all doors, temporarily disabling code access. Code locks on the exterior of the car will light up green instead of red. If all players in cockpit modules dismount, the central locking is automatically. After entering the correct code, players are automatically whitelisted, and wo need to enter the code again. IMPROVEMENTS AND FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Planter Improvements all plants in a planter in action Stone Spear Stone spear is cheaper and quicker to craft Miner Hat Buff Miner hat now offers better protection values Roof Rotation Roof can now be rotated before placement Grenade Crafting Times All grenade crafting times have been reduced Attack Helicopter Loot Improved Attack Helicopter loot tables Garge Doors Pickup Equipping a Hammer to pickup the Garage door is no longer required Armored Door HP Armored door HP increased by Repair Cost Fixes Repairing deployables no longer require components Instrument Range Increase pitch range on several instruments Junkpile Scientists Reduced the number of Scientists at junkpiles Sway Reduced sway when aiming with the Despawn times Various high value items IO Deployment Various IO entities can be placed near floor level Will show when you died first vs Days Upkeep Shows days of upkeep rather than hours No Components For Repair Shotgun Trap, Garage Door, etc UI Scaling Fix small UI on resolutions CABOOSE AT OUTPOST We a static, indestructible train caboose at the Outpost, which has the standard casino inside Poker, Slots, and the Blackjack machine so now you can without the constant fear of death! Find it at the small train platform. EXTERNAL WALL DEBRIS The debris system was introduced in to prevent the ability to replace walls and doors during raids immediately, we feel this system has worked well but often still see raids won purely from spamming walls. To make it a little fairer for the raiders, from today, external walls and gates now have the debris system applied. When external gates or walls are destroyed, they now leave debris for minutes. WORLD EVENT NOTIFICATIONS Players will now be automatically notified via a small UI prompt when world events begin, such as Cargoship, Oilrig crate, Cargo etc. We hope this encourages players to engage with world events more actively and addresses a growing problem of players using services to gain this information instantly before others and having an unfair advantage. We acknowledge a UI notification is not the best solution, but for now, it put everyone on the same playing field while we work towards a better solution in the near future. COMBAT QOL Burst Following last month burst module implementation, I have made the following and improvements Burst can now be toggled using the M bind Burst module slightly lowers aim cone LR The LR and has seen lower usage since the recoil, players who used to opt for the LR often now feel more confident using the AK, so we experimenting with the following and LR now have inbuilt burst module We continue monitoring and adjust accordingly in future updates. Slug Ammo Slug ammo is regularly used over large distances effectively, whilst it great to see slug ammo used to a greater effect with the recent, we agree with feedback it too effective. The slug should be a option in close to combat and less effective over larger distances, so I made the following Slug now does damage at instead of damage at Slug does damage from instead of QUARRY Mining quarries have been updated to run on diesel fuel and output rates greatly improved. In the past, quarries have seen little to no use. We hope these improvements will encourage their use more. We be monitoring and tweaking accordingly. In addition to spawning at the Dome, Oil Rigs and Junkyard, diesel fuel now spawns at the following monuments Water Treatment Plant, Power Plant, Military Tunnels and Airfield. OFFSHORE MONUMENTS Lower lab count but larger Oilrig reset timer increase Cargoship event rarer UPDATED COLORED IO There were only colors of wires originally hose colors which has been enough to organize the creative builds the community has made! Existing Colors black red green blue yellow Colors light blue orange pink purple white Press R while looking at an existing wire to recolor it. SEPARATE NETWORK GROUPS FOR TUNNELS For some background, network groups are what servers use to figure out which entities to network to players. It basically divides the world up into chunks and tracks which entities are within each chunk. This way the server just needs to network the few chunks around each. Previously the world was divided up into a dimensional grid of chunks, and that worked great for a long time, but then we the underground tunnels. Using dimensional network groups means the tunnels would network to players up on the surface, and players in the tunnel are being networked things from the surface, which is great because they ca see any of that so it just wasted work. I updated the network group system this month to add support for vertical layers. So now, instead of a just a single dimensional grid, it essentially stacks multiple dimensional grids on top of each other and uses entity altitude to figure out which layer it belongs on. Tunnel entities will no longer network to the surface, and the surface will no longer network to players in the tunnels. We have found that this can save up to of frametime on the surface by not networking tunnel NPCs to the client. JUNKPILE AI I made a few improvements to help with some of the complaints that people have with Junkpiles. The bushes that spawn with junkpiles now block AI line of sight. This should make the Scientists easier to spot when they shooting at you because they will no longer stand in the middle of a bush. I made the junkpile Scientists more defensive in nature, and they wo engage from as far as they used to. Lastly, I tweaked the AI data for the junkpile cover positions so they fully in cover, which has the knock on effect of reducing return fire. ANIMAL AI I some biome and functionality Animals will no longer roam directly to locations, to help keep them away from beaches. Polar bears will now only roam to arctic and tundra areas, and they will now return to these areas if they need to leave briefly for any other reason. WORLD FOOT I a menu option for eating world foods, such as berries, corn, mushrooms, etc, directly from the ground. Look directly at the food and hold E then select Eat. You still receive seeds and other items as usual. NETTING FIXED Netting now allows you to walk above without getting stuck. You can climb up and slide down without bouncing off the wall frames. TURRET AUTH EASIER Turret UI used to close after you authorized each. The UI now stays open after each you click, until you press Esc. WALL PLACEMENT IMPROVEMENT Building jump ups used to be difficult when you had to look down precisely to get it to snap to the correct place. It now will correctly try to attach to the top of walls. LOCKER FILL IMPROVEMENTS Filling lockers was difficult with the amount of left click dragging required. You should now be able to mindlessly right click armor and have it into all the correct slots. SAM SITE It used to be devastating if enemies shot out your SAM sites were able to shoot off a MLRS before you had a chance to react. You can now pass power through the sam site link it to a smart alarm to detect it being destroyed NETWORKING POSTPONED As mentioned in last month blog, networking was planned to be switched to the default networking layer for today. Due to several issues discovered recently now fixed, we postponing enabling networking by default until January, by then, we hope to be completely satisfied with server stability. As a reminder This change requires servers to have a separate query port set via the server startup parameter. When no query port is set, the server will default to either port or rcon port, depending on which number is larger. Hosts of shared servers will need to ensure the query port is forwarded correctly, which is why we are making this announcement ahead of time. Servers can be switched over to Networking for testing via the startup parameter, which we recommend doing ahead of time in order to ensure a smooth transition. CHRISTMAS On December at EST we be releasing a mandatory server and client to enable the Xmas event and some festive features! CHARITABLE RECAP On November Rustafied held their annual Charitable event. They had event servers up where hundreds of content creators all took part in fun custom, bed wars, carnivals, boat combat contests, and much more. The community raised over in donations alone. We put up some unique charity skins on the item for a week and the proceeds to that towards the charity as well. While we do not have exact totals yet and the skin sales take a few weeks to come in but we guestimate in total, going to World Central Kitchen. We very proud of everyone involved and thank you to those that helped out in any ways to make this event possible!",

It uses a technique called HLOD Hierarchical Level of Detail and involves baking the monument as it should be seen at a distance down into a single mesh. A key requirement was to make sure this did add any extra work for our environment artists, this process is almost entirely automated. The final performance improvements were minimal, but the increased visual fidelity at a distance still seemed worthwhile to ship. You should notice more geometry and detail, as well as entire monuments that will now be visible when they were before.

Splitting ores stacks between input slots will still not increase production rates. SERVER LISTING UI As a part of a large long term menu UI revamp I have made several improvements to the server listing UI this month. Here are the most note worthy regions server tags. tag search behavior to find servers with all of the selected tags instead of any of them. Add a button to clear filters to the server browser. Additionally, I reimplemented dropdown menus in the options menu. This should make life easier than clicking endlessly to find certain options such as screen resolution. CAMPFIRE AND EFFECTS The campfire is of oldest models, dating back to. It was time for an to reflect. Issac has worked his magic and updated the model which can be seen below.

While weighing options we decided to explore a tech tree tax. Unlocking items directly from the Workbench Techtree will now cost additional scrap, Tier Tier Tier The research cost from using the research bench remains unchanged. CONTAINER SIZE IMPROVEMENTS Following last months storage we have now increased car storage module size from to. Camper storage to and Saddle bags to. EAC AND PROTON We aware the server performance has degraded since the release of EAC EOS on September, we actively working with EAC to remedy these issues. Server owners can expect hotfixes over the coming days and weeks. Proton Support You know, we switched to EAC platform with the intention of providing support for the Deck, and so far we have done that. So when is it coming? Well, short answer is we do know. We do know if it is. When we discontinued linux support in, of the core reasons was how the cheating community was exploiting the Linux platform. That not to say that cheating was super widespread on Linux, but it was safer for cheat developers. And that not good in a where a cheater can ruin weeks of hard work. Enabling proton support would mean we asking the EAC to provide support for a whole other platform, which we fear would reduce their ability to support Windows our main platform. We do know whether we should enable platform at the disadvantage of another. The thing we do want to do is to enable Proton support to only discontinue it months later. We do want to encourage players to spend their money on a Deck to and then be in a position where we want to take that ability away. For now, we still weighing up the risks and will continue to explore options with EAC. Do expect to see Proton support in the near future, but we hope to have it enabled someday.

Furnace UI Furnaces cooking interfaces were cumbersome and not intuitive for newer players to use, requiring precise splitting of stacks to smelt efficiently, online calculators and guides to manage efficiently. We disliked this and felt we could do better, so we revamped the UI and some functionality. They smelt and cook at the same speed capacity or better! as before while being quick and easy to use. With this, you no longer be able to non items inside your cooking deployables, to address this see storage buff below. Storage Buff Over the past couple of years, we quadrupled the number of items and switched over to the component system, all of which require large amounts of additional storage. Now with the cooking and smelting UI revamp and removing the ability to items within these deployables campfire, furance etc it was overdue we took a look at storage. Today we increased the small wooden storage capacity to from and the large wooden box to from. In the future expect to see types of storage solutions. Coaling Tower I made some simple improvements to the coaling tower that aired in our last inside the Trainyard monument. These include a way to access the tower from the top where the suspended bridge is located. This will make retreat from the building easier when the area is contested.

The HDRP cliff models are way more temperamental regarding placement than the old ones, and as a result we had our hands full identifying and plugging tons of little holes to stop sneaky players from abusing the map. This fixes every single we had reported and identified. In addition, the long southern and northern road tunnel placeholders have been reworked. Instead of being these overly long and unpractical spaghetti monsters, they now follow a precise and much shorter path to make them a practical way to traverse. We dressed them up and various loot spawns along the way. Lastly, the road surface has been a complete mess since the big, thanks to some technical issues I wo bore you with but this has been tackled now. Roads everywhere should now be smooth to drive on, with no sinking anywhere. I wo over all the other small fixes here and there, but know that we will continue to improve and fix anything else that comes up. Big thanks to all who submitted bug reports!

        "content": "TRAINYARD UNLOADING TOWER The rail network is now connected up to the Trainyard area, and the Trainyard has a tower that can unload certain types of train wagons. Railway sidings will now sometimes spawn unloadable wagons in several varieties Ore wagons filled with sulfur, iron, or charcoal Fuel tank wagons filled with low grade fuel Loot wagons that can be unloaded to reveal loot crates All of these can be hooked up to a train and taken to the unloading tower at Trainyard for unloading. You need a green keycard and a fuse to get full access, after which you can unload as many wagons as you. Ore and fuel into an output hopper and fuel tank respectively inside the tower. Loot wagons activate their crates when emptied so you can then out and loot them. The Work Cart train engine has been reduced in power, and is now only able to pull a small amount of train cars at a time. The large Locomotive provides superior pulling power instead. FLASH BANG AND MOLOTOV COCKTAIL throwable items have been to the. The Molotov Cocktail is a powerful area denial weapon which slows movement and deals damage over time. It can be used to damage and destroy wooden structures. The Flashbang is a short fuse, low damage explosive which will blind and disorient anyone unfortunate enough to be in the blast radius and looking in it general direction. We hoping the addition of this tool reduces the benefit of corner camping and shakes up how room clearing is approached Both are available in the tech tree of the workbench. QOL Updated Wooden Signs The Wooden sign has been received a model Scrap Tea Buff Scrap Tea now yields more scrap and lasts longer Improved Cliff Collision A number of cliff colliders have been improved, making them easier to climb Invalid Projectiles when Mounted Fixed a long standing bug causing invalid projectiles when mounted to vehicles CUBEMAP AMBIENT LIGHT The lighting in has been quite outdated for a long time. The primary reason for this have been our highly dynamic environments that prevent us from using any sort of statically baked lighting data. This resulted in flat and boring looking environments, particularly in areas that were receiving any direct light. To combat this, I finally implemented our own ambient lighting model that uses a blurred version of our existing reflection data, which is already completely dynamic. The lighting model is of course enabled for everybody, but it comes with a few customization options. The previous World Reflections quality setting has been replaced with toggles in the Experimental graphics options Advanced interior lighting, which when enabled includes bases in the lighting model, and advanced forest lighting, does the same for trees. PERFORMANCE WORK I spent a good part of the month looking for client performance optimisations with varying levels of success. I a variety of unnecessary components from all humanoid NPCs Scientist, dwellers, shopkeepers, etc. This should reduce the performance hit when entering network range of an NPC. I unnecessary components from various static entities that are placed in monuments think vending machines, chairs, etc. This should make them spawn faster when entering network range. I made some to our LOD system to more aggressively disable shadows in places where it will make no visual difference. This includes any static prop that is considered small and parts of the body clothing, eyebrows, teeth, etc. These should reduce the number of shadow casting meshes when more than a couple of meters away from a prop or. Both of these can be disabled by the and convars but they will be enabled by default this month. Underground props that are part of the train tunnels are now more aggressively culled if you are in a train tunnel. Made more potential optimisations to the performance drop when hitting a node. This is mostly due to the UI animating in the bottom right of the screen and a lot of the performance cost is happening outside of our control. I still made a few improvements that should hopefully improve it but there is still a mild performance drop. MONUMENT LIGHTING LIGHT SWITCHES I spent some time over the past few weeks adding lights to a bunch of our older monuments. Now nearly all of them should be covered this pass, aside from a few monuments that are meant to be completely abandoned and should remain dark. This includes monuments such as Harbors, Power Plant and the Trainyard. In addition, you will find that the monuments covered by the lighting pass will now feature light switches that you can use to toggle the lights on and off. You can now decide whether you want the comfort of seeing clearly in the dark at a risk of being seen by other players, turn the lights off for your safety while exploring, or use them to ambush unsuspecting players. ADS IMPROVEMENTS We recently saw a video from hJune which helped us identify a long standing issue with the aiming code. Basically, if you when into ADS mode shortly after running, the weapon bob was not immediately disabled, and instead took far too long to gradually dissipate. This resulted in a disparity between the weapon sight and the true aim direction, meaning you were not actually aiming at your target for the first several shots. This has been fixed and aiming down the sight should feel a lot more responsive and snappy. CONTENT REPORTING Thanks to everyone for taking the time to report content last month, we were able to clear a lot of content on official servers as a result. To help us quickly act on your reports, I made a Slack tool this month that allows us to remove any reported content directly from Slack, without having to load the up. If server owners are looking for similar functionality we can recommend the Discord Sign Logger plugin by MJSU. Please keep sending your reports in!

        "content": "Combat Balance Since the release of the Combat, we monitored feedback and overall we happy with the state of the gunplay in. We will continue to listen, and make adjustments when needed. The fuse time on the grenade has been decreased by to. During combat testing we felt that grenades were a bit too easy to evade under most circumstances. Maybe some day we will allow players to cook grenades but right now that seems it would be a bit too cheap of a tactic. The has had it role changed so it feels more a superior SAR. Its fire rate has been increased and recoil modified. We noticed that shotgun slugs were very underused so we have reduced the damage falloff so that shotgun users can opt to utilize them in mid range combat and stand a chance. Lastly, we fixed a long standing issue with viewmodels where the first shot shortly after ADSing would the animation and obscure the screen with the view model. All weapons should feel much more snappy now. Following the release of the combat last month we addressed the following issues earlier this month, here is a recap Improved hide blood option hurt flash disable option is slightly more aggressive HMLMG recoil is more aggressive Lowered HMLMG durability Increased HMLMG crafting cost Using scopes on weapons now increases their recoil Reduced effects Accuracy bonus from the silencer Loading Optimization We worked on reducing the time it takes to load into servers this month. It will now queue up the loading of assets so they can continue being from disk while the main thread spawns all of the world prefabs, which means better utilization of hardware. This applies to the dedicated server so server owners may see some improvement with boot times. The long Asset Warmup phase of loading will now start running in the background as soon as the reaches the main menu. Connecting to a server will not wait for it to complete it will keep running in the background until it finishes. The will no longer unload monument assets when running on a computer with or more of RAM. This allows for much faster server switching because the monument assets would already be loaded. Setting the convar to true will override that behavior so it always unloads the monument assets. Gunshot sounds Alex finished up the remaining gunshot sounds this month, including silent shots for every gun. We likely do another round of tuning on these in the next month or so to address some feedback we gotten but we to allow time for folk ears to adjust and the dust to settle before we dig too deep into that.

This includes all painted signs, audio content on cassettes, carvable pumpkins, neon signs and pattern boomers. As well as being able to the content, admins can now see who was responsible for the content and delete the content from the UI without having to travel to that entity. There is a search field so all content created by a specific can be found quickly. Content Reporting We improved the process of reporting problematic content this month by implementing a Content report type. When reporting content a screenshot will now be included to better help admins act on the issue. For server admins, there are convars to better access these reports reportsServerEndpoint if set, reports on your server will be sent to this address as JSON printReportsToConsole if set, reports will be logged to the server log For more information on using these convars, please see the wiki. Hapis Island updates Along with numerous small bugfixes, we monuments to Hapis Island. of them in the desert, and in the northern arctic. We fixed most of the mountain goat ore nodes, berry bushes not spawning, roadside spawns being overly sparse, and updated some existing monuments to be more in line with where they now stand on Procedural Map. Some bugs still remain, but we ironing it out. Thanks for all the bug reports! Harmony QOL You can now harmony mods onto the server at runtime with and unload with This will allow all server owners vanilla or modded to deploy fixes onto their servers without needing to restart them, as well as ease development of harmony mods. Chat Filtering We now using chat filtering functionality to obscure language and slurs in chat and other text players can share in the. The filtering is applied on the client and can be customized in your account preferences. If you have changed these settings before then filtering would already be enabled. DEBUG CAMERA ADDITIONS A few debug camera commands have been this month for content creators to use. As with existing camera tools, these can only be used by server admins or in demo playback. Physical Camera Properties We the ability for the debug camera to use physical camera properties in other words, you can choose from common camera sensor types and specify a focal length to mimic real world photography measurements. Below are the newly commands for using physical camera settings physical camera properties on debug camera Prints camera sensor types with corresponding number Select physical sensor for debug camera use sensor ID number from the above convar Set focal length of the debug camera Measured in mm Camera Info UI Along with the above physical camera commands, we camera information UI which can be using the command When enabled, this overlay will display the following information at the top of the screen Camera FOV Depth of field aperture and blur values Camera lock status Sensor type if using physical camera mode Focal length if using physical camera mode MAP MAKER PREFABS This month we some useful assets for community map makers the most notable being the introduction of tiled cube prefabs. The current collection features over cubes with materials including brick, wood, metal, concrete, plaster, metal, cloth and more. Each cube can be scaled, rotated and positioned in custom map scenes whilst maintaining the local tiling of the individual prefab texture. We look forward to seeing the many creative ways map makers will utilize these assets and we hope to continue expanding this collection in the future. Acknowledgements We currently aware and investigating certain performance issues affecting a large number of users, this is known to be affecting applications such as Discord, we believe this is possibly fixed today via an by EAC. We are actively investigating a number of other areas with poor performance.

        "content": "Combat Today, we releasing an to the gunplay in. The initial implementation of the weapons in was done nearly years ago and has been significantly modified since it inception. While these will be controversial, We believe these are necessary for the health of the. Recoil The old recoil system in had some issues. It was loved by some, and hated by others. If you did have hundreds if not thousands of hours practicing the recoil in, Firing at people in the would often feel attempting to align poled magnets. Frustrating would be an understatement. Ultimately, being good at first person shooters and having the drop on someone was good enough. If the other person had thousands of hours of training their aim you stood very little chance. This was fun for people who could spend thousands of hours training their aim, or morally bankrupt individuals who would choose to use scripts to gain an advantage. This was not fun for of the population, and it time for a change. Instead of pattern based recoil, we now implement a gradient based aim drift and inaccuracy for automatic weapons. That is to say, the longer you hold down the trigger, the more inaccurate the weapon becomes. It still takes skill to try and keep it centered on the target, but it is not the same with each burst. We updated aimcone inaccuracy of bullets relative to where you are aiming to use a weighted system, so that roughly of the shots will land in the center. This means that automatic fire at a long range effectively decreases DPS. This encourages players to use the right weapons in the right situations and to improve their tactics and burst discipline. There should be less beaming going on. What this has done is compressed the skill ceiling, and we think this is a good thing. Perfectly replicated recoil meant that mouse scripts could be abused to put rounds on target at, every time. In addition to the aforementioned recoil, we went through and modernized some other elements of the person shooter experience. Sounds The most immediately noticeable change is the sound effects of most of the guns have been updated. This might take some getting used to but the quality has improved significantly. View models The View Models have had their dynamic animations updated. You notice the walking bob is much improved, as is the sway when looking. It a small change but helps to bring things into this decade. View Models have a crisper punch back when firing, and they animate the main camera during reloads to emphasize the hand actions. We head bob which is active when sprinting, it a small touch but adds to the experience. You can turn this off in the options. All of these elements combined gives the weapons in a much cleaner and modern feeling. Hit punch directional markers We felt that there were some issues knowing where you were taking damage from, with large splotches of blood covering most of the screen during high damage encounters. We changed this so that you now receive a smaller semicircle blood splat indicating the direction you took damage from, and a small amount of Screen Shake. Please note that silenced shots will not produce a damage indicator on the victims HUD. Hit cross We a visual hit indicator to accompany the sound you all familiar with. Upon landing a successful hit onto another or AI you now notice a hit marker cross briefly appearing. Crosshair years ago in legacy, people would tie dental floss to the top and sides of their monitor to create a crosshair in the center. Now everyone can simply enable on their monitor or using third party software. Because of this we decided to add a crosshair to the natively. The crosshair will give you a rough idea of your accuracy based on the weapon you are holding and your stance. We be looking at crosshair customization options in the future, as well as specific crosshairs for different weapon types, etc. The crosshair can be disabled within the options menu if you hate it and third party crosshairs are allowed to be used. As always, this is a work in progress, We going to review all the feedback and continue to make adjustments until we get this right. Everything is subject to change. Handmade LMG The handmade light machine gun is a tier craftable weapon, with high damage, a high rate of fire, and low accuracy but great at suppressing fire. Crafting cost HQM, rifle body, metal springs and gears. Extended magazine The extended magazine is a tier weapon attachment which can be attached to most guns, providing an additional ammo capacity. Crafting cost high quality metal. Mixing Table Ammo Hate standing around crafting ammo? You can now craft basic ammo types from the mixing table. Players are still required to have the ammo blueprint unlocked. General QOL Rail Speed Boost Horses on train tracks receive the same speed boost as on roads Coupled Car Display The train screen now shows the number of connected cars Land Mine The Landmine is now scaled down Projectile Invalid We resolved a number of invalid projectiles whilst shooting under low ceiling Vehicle Sensitivity Vehicles will now grab all mouse input leading to smoother control Compound Bow Now loses less durability while held back An artifact of fixing vehicle sensitivity is players are used to the incorrect sensitivity. If your vehicle still feels difficult to control, please use the options menu Vehicle sensitivity slider or the console command whatever value you want to adjust to your liking. Launch Site AI Scientists have been to the main building at the Launch Site monument. You can expect to see them patrolling the various floors as well as the rooftop area. As with some of the other recently Scientists, these ones can use healing items, too. Covered Work cart There a Work Cart train variant that will sometimes spawn on the rails, which has some more cover at the back. It marginally slower than the other, but otherwise behaves the same. In the near future, we have a proper locomotive and more rail system updates on the way. Rail Sidings Expanding upon last month rail network, this month we closer rail sidings to sections of the rail network. Train spawns have been moved to those sidings in order to free up the main rail for traffic. Graffiti Pack The spray can has received an upgrade with the Graffiti Pack available in the Item. Once purchased, you can choose from a variety of decals to spray in the world, as well as a free paint mode letting your creativity run wild. Once purchased, hold Reload R to browse the decal options or to switch to free spray mode. While in free spray mode you can press Interact E to change spray size and Reload to change colour or switch back to decal mode. Found some graffiti on your base? Simply interact with the spray while holding something filled with water Bota bag, bucket, bottle, etc to clear the spray off. By default sprays should last three hours. There is a cap on how many sprays can be sprayed by a given at the moment that we keep an eye on and raise if possible in future updates. Streamers should note that sprays sprayed by other players wo be visible when Hide Signs is active, although your own signs will still be visible. The reskin ability remains unchanged and is still available to everyone. Hapis Island For those of you who prefer more familiar surroundings, we releasing the updated Hapis Island today, which has been AWOL ever since our last graphical broke it. It should all be pretty familiar, with the exception that we decided to expand the desert in the south, and make it a proper desert this time. We a few more secondary islands, along with some other small additions that I leave you to discover. Later on I expect we will add the railroads to it as well, but for now we just wanted to get it out there. All blueprints on Facepunch Hapis Island servers will be wiped today.

        "content": "Trains We wanted to get some trains onto the rails this month. We have some more train content in the works, but for this initial release we mostly reusing existing assets in order to provide something to try out until that content is ready. The Work Cart closely resembles the underground, but now has coupling points at each end that can connect to other train cars. The bogies known as trucks the wheel assemblies have been updated to rotate with the track more realistically. We taken some static train wagon models that we had and made them functional. These do actually do anything special yet, but they spawn along with Work Carts on the rail sidings and they can be shunted around. The Work Cart train engines take low grade fuel as usual. Their target speeds at throttle are constant, but their acceleration and pulling ability are affected by gravity and how many couples wagons they pulling as you expect. If your long train ca make it up a hill, it possible to use multiple Work Carts in a coupled setup for more power. Coupling happens automatically when wagons collide at a low to moderate speed. High speed collisions will not couple, and may take damage instead. Uncoupling is manual simply interact with the coupling point. Rail Network Branch Lines The rail network has received secondary lines that branch off the main line and merge back onto it. This all happens entirely procedurally with no need for predetermined prefabs aside from the rail mesh itself, which results in a very flexible system that can cover a wide range of use cases as we expand the rail network in the future. For now, these branch lines are just where the trains are spawning. We will see how things work out and from there. Rail and road foliage improvements The foliage bushes spawning next to rails and roads have received some optimizations to eliminate their overhead as you move around the world. They now spawn in larger clusters with varying coverage, resulting in some dense areas and some open areas, which allowed us to reduce their total count as a performance improvement without having it affect the visuals too much. Zipline Improvements Ziplines seemed to be well used last month, but there were too many cases of ziplines failing to connect, leading to zipline platforms with no connections. I improved the procedural generation process this month in a few different ways. Ziplines are now better at routing around obstacles, allowing ziplines to via separate before arriving at their destination. I zipline arrival points at Sewer Branch, Stables, Lighthouse and Dome. All of these combined have improved the number of ziplines on procedural maps by about. Death screen Improvements The death screen has been improved this month with many NPC getting custom icons and proper translations. We improved how we show your death information if you suicide while downed. Previously doing this would result in the death screen showing your death as a suicide, preventing you from seeing the name and weapon of your attacker. This is now fixed and you will see the last attack details even if you suicide while downed. Client Performance Client performance was identified as a growing issue last month so we all put some time aside to try and improve performance this month. We made good progress in some key areas Fixed a regression introduced last month that was generating a lot of garbage and causing stutters. This was deemed high enough priority that we it in a hotfix early in the month. Identified a bug that was preventing lasers and some other heavy systems from budgeting their performance correctly This was affecting server performance. Significantly reduced network traffic from planters and plants getting watered by sprinklers. Performance is always a high priority for us and we got more improvements being worked on for future updates. General QOL SAM Site Damage SAM Site can no longer be damaged by bullet type damage Junkpile scientists NPCs have returned to junkpile spawns Community UI Improvements We integrated several pull requests from the Community UI Github project this month, bringing improvements blocking keyboard input while in text boxes, better item and skin rendering as well as fixing a handful of bugs. Thank you to Ailtop,, and Mughisi for the contributions. We have some more improvements to this system in the works, specifically to improve rendering and network performance on rapidly updated UI displays.

To access the zipline you need to climb to the top of the platforms that are attached to some powerlines. Once at the top, you can use the zipline to travel to another platform further along the chain of powerlines or to nearby monuments. You can speed up on the line by holding forward and jump off at anytime with the jump key just be careful of the drop!.

Unfortunately they have kept up with the amount of content to the every month so we made a set of achievements to earn. As usual, achievements can only be earned on official servers. Monument Lighting Continued We have continued improving the lighting setup for our monuments. This month we have focused mainly on the monuments such as Lighthouse, Fishing Villages, Stables, Excavator, Arctic Research Base and Airfield. The degree of improvements varies depending on the monument. Some of the newer monuments Fishing Villages, Stables and Excavator received only minor updates. This includes such as adding darkening volumes to interiors, adding ambient lights and enabling interior lights during the daytime. Other monuments Lighthouse and Arctic Research base received more extensive upgrades, which includes a whole lot of lights, that will make the monuments significantly brighter during nighttime and more atmospheric during daytime. The monument that received the biggest upgrade this month is the Airfield. Here we have not only lights and darkening volumes, but tweaked some materials and a lot of prop dressing to bring it to the same level of quality of our newer monuments. General QOL Landmine The landmine has received a visual refresh Loading Background Loading screen image will now alternate between images Magnet Crane Further improvements to the junkyard magnet crane handling Networking We have updated Networking to the latest version, which comes with a number of important performance improvements.

        "content": "Monument Lighting This month we ve made visual improvements to some of our older monuments to get them more consistent with the quality of our content. This includes such as adding darkening volumes to interiors to prevent them from becoming too bright during the day, adding lights and effects, tweaking existing lighting and other minor visual improvements. As a result, the interiors should feel much darker and more atmospheric. The monuments that we ve changed so far are the Supermarket, Oxum Gas Station, Bandit Camp and Launch Site and we plan to improve more of them over time. Soundtrack Release This month we excited to announce the release of official soundtrack available now on, music streaming services and a handful of digital stores. This initial release Volume is comprised of tracks clocking in around hour and minutes of music. Alex originally wrote a lot of these songs for our videos but he been expanding them into more fleshed out, standalone pieces of music. There some songs he has written to fit the occasional calm moment in that you wo have heard at all yet. Alex is in the process of getting these songs chopped up and implemented to playback dynamically in as well. Around half of the tracks are ready in this, and the rest should follow shortly. Listen now on your favourite music streaming platforms, including Spotify Apple Music Bandcamp YouTube Music Amazon Music And many more digital music stores! Improved vehicle body visuals This month we been exploring ways to improve the visual experience when driving vehicles. While we initially explored dedicated viewmodels for vehicles floating arms in front of the camera we settled on using the full body mesh with tweaked hand logic. You can see this most obviously on the Snowmobile, the driver seat of Modular Cars and the Workcart, while it visible but less obvious on the Minicopter and Scrap Transport Helicopter. This approach allows us to highlight the hand IK on vehicles snowmobiles and cars so you can see your arms turning. There some subtle camera movement if the model leans or moves on the Snowmobile. Magnet Crane Cleanup We looked at the junkyard magnet crane this month to see if some bugs and the general feel of it could be improved. It now a bit more stable to drive, and old issues the driver not quite visually syncing up with the cabin as it rotates are fixed. Another concern with the crane was that with its controls being pretty complex, it was easy to burn through your fuel just learning them. To combat that, we reduced the fuel it uses at idle by, and the maximum fuel it uses when not holding anything by. So if you just practicing moving the magnet arm and rotating the cabin, your fuel will only be being consumed at of the rate it was before. Snowmobile Cleanup We some small final touches to the snowmobiles. Most were minor bug fixes, but an obvious is that animations are improved, with the driver now getting visually bumped around at times, and showing an idle animation cycle. Audio is improved as well, with the snowmobile revving more realistically when driving up hills. For balance, the arctic base snowmobile no longer comes loaded with any fuel. World Model There are some assets that need world models and some that needed refreshing so towards the end of last year completed a number of and updated world models, these are now! General QOL Slower Car Decay Cars decay slower when left outdoors Alt Look Restrictions Restrict how far up a can look with alt look while looking down Water catchers barrels now decay Should lower the number of catchers and barrels that are left outside Large Furnace Heat Large furnaces now provide comfort and heat Monument Loot Hiding Monument loot no longer spawns when players are within of the spawn point Phantom We believe we now fixed a long standing issue of hearing phantom footsteps Night Vision and post fixes We had reports of the NVG effect being blown out for a while. When we looked into it, we realised that it only looks incorrect on procedural maps. After a lot of digging, we found that there was a post process volume placed inside of moon pools set to rather than local erroneously. This means that it was being applied all of the time and messing with exposure settings. This means that it had an effect on the overall exposure of the for while, although this has been a bit less apparent than with NVG. Search and loading screen The loading screen was long overdue for a revamp, you now see server stats and a more clear tooltip sections while loading into the server of choice. In a future, the background image will randomly change through a preselected gallery on each load. Additionally, we support for tag filtering to the server browser to make finding servers of interest easier.

The Arctic Research Base will spawn exclusively in the arctic biome. Those who are not afraid of the cold winds and frigid temperatures will be able to explore various lab modules and buildings scattered around the base. You will find there a bunch of loot to scavenge, or take a little break to warm yourself next to an electric heater. But most importantly, the Arctic Research Base will spawn snowmobiles. Keep in mind, however, that scientists wo appreciate your presence and will shoot you on sight. Snowmobiles We a vehicle that only available through a puzzle at the Arctic Base Snowmobiles. Snowmobiles take fuel and have a small storage container on the back. They fast on snow and sand and slow everywhere else. They drive smoothly even over rough terrain but take some skill to control well. When you find in an Arctic Base, it have fuel ready to. A passenger can sit on the back and face any direction, allowing them to shoot to the sides or even directly behind. POLAR BEARS You now be encountering the polar bear in the arctic biome. The polar bear is the strongest and most hostile animal in the world but yields extra resources when harvested compared to its bear cousin. The regular bear will no longer be spawning in the arctic and receive slight health and hostile reduction. AI We the ability for scientists to use medical items to heal themselves. Scientists have a chance of spawning with the ability. We initially enabled this at the arctic research station and we add it to other areas of the soon. We made some timing, balance and movement tweaks to the scientist AI. Spraycan The Spraycan is a default tool that can be crafted for metal fragments that allows you to reskin items that have been deployed in the world. Instead of having to pick up items and use a Repair Bench, you can simply use RMB while holding a Spraycan to open up the skin options and select a skin. You may have seen some further spray functionality on the Staging branch this month, however these features had some issues so we had to delay them for a future.

The higher your base framerate was, the more severe these dips would appear to be. After doing a bunch of profiling, we noticed that there were some significant stalls on the render thread and our tree impostor system was most likely the cause of the issue, even though the population had only been tweaked very slightly recently. With the fix, framerates should be a lot more consistent again as long as what being rendered is consistent and should overall be slightly higher in general, particularly in areas with a lot of bushes and trees Bandit Camp. Permanent Arctic Pack This month we introducing a addition to permanent, the Arctic Pack. The Arctic Pack contains items which can be seen below. Arctic Suit The Arctic Suit is a hazmat skin that can be applied while crafting the hazmat or skinned using the repair table. The arctic suit offers slightly higher cold protection but at the cost of lower radiation, melee and explosive protection. Tomaha Snowmobile The Tomaha snowmobile cosmetic skin can be applied by using the spray can on the snowmobile which can be found at the arctic research station monument.

Work continued at pace, features being the research bench, a water system along with a sky system, bugs being squashed, some quite serious. It was decided we needed a better way of telling guys what we were doing in the background so weekly updates were started and with that came the Friday blog in March. Not long after this, we realised was getting too big for Unity and we were getting seriously limited on how much we could grow which would impact on how you could and enjoy the, it was decided we would switch to Unity and while you continued to enjoy playing the we would completely rebuild the from scratch. It was a huge decision and task but made what it is today. In July we started the Community Blog which would showcase what our players and creators were doing in from builds and raids to erm rituals to Garry. By the end of the groundwork for the reboot was set, instead of the same map on every server, the island could be generated procedurally giving every server it own identity. Custom weapons were designed and modelled to give more of a hand crafted feel tools were created to help you get the resources you need, including the iconic rock and the hatchet. Useful for farming the animals that were for food and more resources. Having resources meant you were going to need a nice base to keep them in and the building system came to life, not only could you create the design you wanted with building pieces you could now upgrade it to different materials to give your base more strength. This progressed from late into early as a system you might recognise today and you could use a Tool Cupboard to give ownership to your base! continued to build up on the groundwork set and the islands got more procedural features roads and power lines between the monuments. Everyone had the same male character so It was decided we should add more varieties and a female character which could all be randomly assigned to players, we gave them armour for protection from each other. By the end of the year we had Beartraps, Assualt Rifle, Pump Shotgun,, Attack Helicopter, Ambient Sound, Gibbing, Decay, Paintable Signs, Rocket Launcher, Monuments, Assigning sleeping bag to friends, Repair Bench, Guitars, Building Upgrades, skin colours, Wounding, Hapis Island, Rivers, Research Table, Barricades, Bullet Penetration, Large Furnace, Loot, Decals, Ammo Counters, Blueprints System, Grenades, Horses, Landmines, Water Catchers, Crossbow, Code Locks, Maps, SMG, Supply Signal, Floor Spikes, Language Selector, Pistol, Ladders, Throwables, Pickable and load of bug fixes, optimizations and visual improvements. got it first Christmas Event! Shortly after, we realised weekly updates were ideal for us, we lose a day of development time preparing the and dealing with any issues that came up post, this downtime would be less noticeable over the period of a month so the switch was made to the monthly updates you know today and have been happening since. As you can see, the first years kept us busy, skip forward and the last years have been just as busy pushing out content month after month. Here are some of the highlights and the associated trailers! Instruments DLC For our first DLC we gave you the opportunity to get together and jam with your friends or annoy your neighbours. Modular Turrets Since it creation, the turret came with an included assault rifle, we gave you the option to add any weapon or trumpet to your turrets! Farming Brought you ways of growing your own crops with automated watering systems to keep you supplied with food and cloth. The companion app for your phones to help you organise your, control your electronics and receive notifications from in. Modular Vehicles A way of getting around the island in a variety of setups depending on your needs, Sunburn DLC Our DLC full of summer essentials from lazing on a rubber ring in your pool to water pistol fights on the beaches. Tech Tree We gave you the option of unlocking blueprints on a linear path rather than having to find each blueprint in loot During the Christmas holiday period of received a massive boost when we were joined by a variety of well known streamers and content creators with events being run by OfflineTV and their friends and Egoland and their friends who spotlighted to viewers who had probably never seen or thought of joining us and gave us a huge boost with record counts and viewership. This gave the developers a boost and spurred us on to bring more content for players to enjoy. Freight Transit Line A underground system throughout the whole map which gives you another option for getting around the monuments. Voiceprops DLC Our latest DLC for recording and playback of voice and audio to making your own in disco. Underwater Another way to explore the environment, submarines to transport you around and underwater labs to explore and loot!

Excavator Tummy Tuck We have frequently heard from you about the limited real estate left available on some map seeds. of the main complaint was about the Giant Excavator monument.

AI Cleanup Tweaks This month we were finally able to remove more of the various AI setups that we had in over the years. Now pretty much everything is running on system. This meant we were able to remove a ton of code and prefabs this is better for maintenance and long term development of the AI. There should be some slight performance improvements. We made some tweaks to the animal and human AI, such as fixing some annoyances and increasing responsiveness. There more improvements to come in this area now that the bigger features are finished. Forest Density Since the World Revamp, we received a lot of feedback surrounding forest density, the aim of world revamp was to upgrade visuals without sacrificing. While balancing performance to visual fidelity we were conservative with foliage density values while trying to match them closely as possible to the prior procedural generation. Today we slightly but noticeably increased forest density, we hope this will bring back some forest density while keeping performance under control. Blueprint Wipe With today, all servers will have their Blueprints wiped and progress reset.

I excited to show you some actual server transitioning yes, me boldly going between servers, Shadowfrax says in his latest clip covering features below. The YouTuber got to test the feature on a limited scale as it functions right now, with servers linked up in his example. You can see the other from your current server as depicted by a rough outline of an island in the distance, across the sea. If you hop in a boat and zoom towards the island you soon get a message as you near the map edges, which tells you how much further you need to travel before you hit the other server. If you keep on barrelling in that direction, you then connect to the other server. So, it sounds it be to use. It appears that right now there no restriction on what you can take with you in your inventory, Shadowfrax says, though only boats let you in at the moment. a the rest of the story RELATED LINKS a skins here are this week items a gets a permanent with premium cosmetics a November brings desert bases and rocket launching system",

Apparently, the a that hang about by the bases wo be thrilled to see players approach, though, so be prepared to face resistance from them.

        "content": "This month brings the foundation of the mission system, huge amount of quality of life improvements, a camper vehicle module and much more! Missions Today we introducing the first iteration of a mission system to. You are now able to speak to various NPCs found around the world and receive a list of objectives you must complete in exchange for a reward. This first pass of missions are geared more towards players just getting started but the system is capable of much more. We will be expanding on this in the coming months to include PvP missions capture and hold, delivery, ambush and eventually even bounty hunting. You can find mission providers at most safe zones and their tasks vary, from catching fish or harvesting lumber to hunting sharks and uncovering hidden treasure. The mission system will be expanded upon over the coming months. We look forward to reading your feedback. Camper Module Take that long overdue vacation in the Camper module for your modular car. It s a slot module that includes seats that function as spawn points, overhead lockers, a bbq and a small box worth of storage. To mark a seat in the camper van as a respawn point simply sit in it, look down and use Make Bed to claim it. You will then be able to respawn directly into that seat regardless of its location, even while the car is moving! If another has claimed a seat, you have to clear their ownership before you can claim it as your own this will appear as an interaction option. The module requires a workbench, Metal Frags and Wood to craft. You ll find the locker above the seats, the barbecue to your side and the small storage box underneath the barbecue. Happy camping! General QOL Jarryd spent some time this month working through a backlog of quality of life improvements that we ve assembled internally. Thankfully all of you in the community had plenty more ideas so after a month of work the QOL list is now even longer than it was at the start. Thanks to everyone across Discord, Reddit and Twitter for suggesting ideas! If your suggestion wasn t implemented this month rest assured we ve taken plenty of notes for future work in this area. A lot of the are pretty scattershot and all around the see the changelog for more details, but some of the notable are below. Sign Painting The primary improvement for sign painting this month is being able to pick up signs and redeploy them without losing the painted content. You can now pick up signs, picture frames and neon signs with the hammer, inspect the painting in your inventory, trade it to others and redeploy it at will. The sign painting interface has had some improvements, including being able to voice chat while painting and better lighting settings for large paintable sources. Auto Turrets After many many requests we re adding the ability to authorize friends to auto turrets, as well as automatically authorizing yourself when placing the auto turret. Door opening while wounded You ll now need to hold down the interact key to open the door while wounded. Watch out for door campers! Admin UI We ve created a simple admin UI accessible in the menu for server admins to easily modify and administrate their server. This isn t meant to be a replacement for RCON or the console, but hopefully it will act as a simpler way for admins to manage basic elements of their server. If there are more features you d to see feel free to reach out, this is just the first iteration of this tool.

        "content": "Underwater Labs Improvements Since the Underwater Labs release, we been following your feedback closely. The majority of feedback was surrounding high loot density and lack of interaction. We now reduced the map Labs count from to, red and blue keycard spawns, additionally loot crates will no longer spawn while players are nearby. To suit the reduced total number of underwater labs per map, we increased the smallest allowed size per underwater lab. You will no longer find underwater labs that are only a couple of rooms in size, so they should all be worth a visit. Many of you have certainly noticed that the moonpool water was bullet proof. This was an unintended effect from the complexities of dealing with the water carving volumes and has now been fixed. Speaking of moonpools, a human sized version has been in the mix to allow for more points of entry in the labs. Finally, we addressed a number of small glitches in the procedural generation that could cause corridor, iceberg and vegetation overlaps. SUBMARINES Storage Both types of submarine now have storage with slots. Torpedoes The Surface torpedo has been due to players camping underwater with little to no risk. Torpedoes can still be fired at surface targets by surfacing the submarine and firing a standard torpedo. Oxygen Submarines now need to surface for air every ten minutes, either on the ocean surface or in a moon pool. Otherwise, after ten minutes you start taking slow damage. As part of implementing this change, I revamped the oxygen UI a bit, and you can now see how much time you have left from a diving tank as well. Other The rear passenger in a duo sub can now turn all the way around. Sonar blips only show up for other running subs, not every sub that parked in someone base. And subs stop moving a lot more quickly when someone dismounts, meaning they wo run away on you if you accidentally dismount underwater. Submarines now take additional damage from bullets. Fishing Village Shop A custom shop has been inside the fishing villages to accommodate all your fishing gear needs.

In Shadowfrax latest below the YouTuber notes that after the next you should see torpedoes get slapped with a bit of a nerf. Torpedoes will get a larger with less accuracy over distance. Plus, a change is coming that add a small puff of smoke to the submarine when it fires a shot to signal where it came from so, it sounds they be a tad less sneaky once that be rolled out. Additionally, the notes that in commits, there a branch tied to oxygen which indicates some aimed at changing how long you can stay holed away in your sub.

They will come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and for now, with entry points. You enter them from a moonpool in which you with your submarine. From there, make sure you have come prepared to face the various puzzles on offer. The bases have a wide network of CCTV cameras you can connect to to plan your exploration ahead of time. The and improved map will let you see the layout of the base for each floor. You will find microphones in some rooms that let you broadcast your commands into the entire base s network.

The submarine seats up to, with internal fuel access and an instrument cluster including rudimentary sonar. Look around behind you and you see interaction UI to swap seats. The submarine seats, with external fuel access and no instruments. Torpedoes Both submarines have torpedo tubes which can fire torpedo types Direct torpedoes fire straight ahead. Surface torpedoes rise to the surface and then speed along the top of the water. You can buy torpedoes from a fishing village vending machine, or craft them yourself. Controls Use movement keys for. Sprint button to rise towards the surface. Crouch button to dive deeper. Look down when in the cockpit to load torpedoes. Fire when in water with the usual shoot button left mouse button by default. Enter underwater bases at moon pool locations, which show up on sonar in the duo sub as red dots. If you in the solo sub, look for the lights being cast down below moon pool modules. Decay Submarines have the same decay style as rowboats and the RHIB. For the first minutes of being unused, they wo decay. Then they start to lose health They last another minutes if left unused outside, or minutes if in deep water. If they indoors and NOT in deep water, they wo ever decay at all. Fishing The Handmade Fishing Rod is now fully functional and ready for use! To get started, you need to equip a bait in the lure slot of the rod. Various foods can be used as bait and their value as a bait is displayed in the item information. As well as food you can now randomly find worms and grubs when collecting resources in the world berries, hemp, potatoes, etc. You have double chance of finding these when harvesting plants planted by a. Once you got a bait ready to simply aim at the water while holding RMB and cast out with LMB. Once you got a bite, you need to reel in the fish. You can use to pull left and right and S to reel the fish in. Fighting the movement of the fish left and right will tire it out and make it move less over time. However reeling in the fish and pulling left and right will put strain on the line, if you strain it too much the line will snap and the fish will get away. The rod will start shaking and you start hearing audio cues when the line is strained, so be sure to stop if your line is about to snap. We types of fish to catch, from Herring, Anchovy and Sardines to Yellow Perch, Catfish, Small Sharks, Salmon and Orange Roughy. Different fish have different conditions for catching, including bait value, water type, water depth and location. As well as gutting the fish for resources, you can take your catches to any fishing village to exchange for scrap. Underwater Ambience Effects We made some to the general underwater look and feel. Visibility has gone up across the board, lighting will get darker the deeper you, and it should just be a bit more engaging than the dive into water and become blind unless you got the magic goggles equipped. Speaking of goggles, the diving goggle screen overlay does self illuminate anymore in darkness, which should make them less distracting to use in. And finally the wet shore look no longer extends deep down into the ocean, which never made any sense in the first place. These are all fairly technical, so expect to see more improvements underwater as we iterate on them in the future. Sharks Exploring the deep may yield great rewards, but with those rewards comes great risks. Each dive site has a chance to spawn a shark which will patrol the area and must be defeated before you are able to claim whatever treasures found at the dive site. You can use a melee weapon in an attempt to defend yourself but your chances of survival are very slim without some kind of underwater ranged weapon Speargun To be able to defend yourself at a distance underwater is of paramount importance given the introduction of hostile marine life. You can now learn how to craft a spear gun ammo from a Level Workbench. This weapon can only be fired while underwater and packs a punch similar to a crossbow, albeit with a slower moving projectile. It is very effective at dispatching hostile human beings.

Until now, we have been spawning the workcarts right in front of the rail platforms. However, this has always been a temporary solution and in this we have dedicated side tunnels and maintenance rooms where the workcarts will spawn from now on. Each station will contain of these side tunnels. In order to access these spawn points you will need to reach the platform and find of the door marked with a green Maintenance Room sign. Then simply follow the corridor and it will lead you to a room where the workcart will be waiting for you. The train tunnel in front of you will then lead you back to the rail network. In addition, while I was working on these side rooms I have fixed a long standing issue where jumping onto the rail platforms from the tracks below was too difficult. Now if you happen to fall off the platform you can jump right back. Check out the changelog for more.",

As yet, there are no images to share of sharks, but the intrepid a noreferrer YouTuber Shadowfrax has a video that goes into a bit of detail about what on the horizon in the next updates. He speculates that sharks will likely be restricted to specific areas in the ocean, and in any case, a great way to avoid sharks both in and in real life is to simply stay on dry land. However, if you do find yourself face to snout with a shark, you want to have a nice speargun at your side.

They get a bit more health than they used to in the old incapacitated state. This might allow you to move to relative safety. The older incapacitated wounded state still occurs in the following situations If you get looted while in crawling wounded state. If you die from fall damage. If you crawl too deep into water. In both states you still have some chance to recover after the wounded timer runs out. By default right now the base value is a chance while crawling and a chance while incapacitated. But you now get up to a bonus on top of that so max total based on your food and water levels. Maximum food and water full bonus. If the above check fails, but you have a large medkit in your belt not just your inventory, the medkit will be used up and you wo get any health from it, but you will recover from being wounded.. A medkit in a belt slot gives a chance at recovery when the recovery timer runs out you can still get killed while wounded by taking damage though. And if you lucky enough that you pass the recovey check anyway, the medkit is used. There is exception where the medkit revive does happen Fall damage.

Train Tunnel Entrance Improvements We a number of improvements to the train tunnel entrances. The bottom of the stairwells now have a circular stairwell piece that is used to align the stairwell to the train tunnel grid. This has the advantage that we no longer have to snap the entrance building to a specific rotation and position, which allows us to integrate them a lot nicer inside monuments. We planning to move more tunnel entrances to building basements or inside static monument tunnels or sewers in the near future. While we implemented these circular stairwells we addressed an issue that was forcing the stairwells and elevator shafts to be extremely long, which led to boring elevator rides down to the train tunnels. This is now addressed, and the stairwells and elevator shafts that down to the train tunnels are significantly shorter. Countryside Tunnel Entrances this month is a refresh of the train tunnel entrances spawning in the countryside, as in any entrance that lives outside of monuments. We have redone the visuals to look bunkers on the surface and improved the interior layout to offer more tactical options. You will find a computer station in these countryside entrances that will allow you to connect to a CCTV camera outdoor and ensure all is clear outside before leaving. Monument AI This month we the first pass of AI scientists to the Trainyard and Airfield monuments, initially around the puzzle areas. This will be expanded to all major monuments in the near future. There a bunch of general bug fixes, improvements, balance and tweaks to both the animal and human AI including a fix for unresponsive AI at low server FPS.

You be reduced to crawling if your health drops to zero by most means following the falling from a massive height not included. Unlike incapacitation, this version of being wounded lets you move about and open doors though slowly, of course and tops up your health a little more.

Players are automatically to the category if you been in close proximity for several seconds. Any who kills you will be to your Enemy list. You can select any contact from the list and filter by category as well as assign a contact to a category. Binoculars have received a buff, and will allow you to see a colored pip above players indicating if they are an enemy or a friend. There is a rudimentary reputation system in the works which will very slightly shade your nametag either blue or red based on how likely you are to kill on sight. This system is a work in progress and will be expanded upon in the future. Any server can disable the contacts system with the convar false The nametag system has changed and you can now display your name plate at long distances to anyone you are looking at by using the gesture. We hope this will allow players to avoid killing other players and grant the ability to signal your intentions.

Wire Colour Coding This was suggested on Reddit and we all felt it was a good idea so I the ability to colour code your electrical wires and hoses this month. Simply hold Reload while holding the Wire Tool to select which colour you d to use. Demo Shot System This month we re adding the first iteration of a more advanced feature set for viewing and manipulating demos. This has primarily been built to improve our internal production tools, but considering the rich and diverse community of content creators out there we d love for this to be a tool that all of you can use. Once you load a demo with turned on, you ll see a variety of options including a shot manager and scrubbable timeline. Pressing the ALT key at any time will switch control between the demo UI and debug camera. You can now create and manage within demos, which are individual recordings of camera motion as well as properties such as FOV and DOF. These shots can then be played back with the demo scene. To create a shot, simply press the Shot button, give it a name and then hit record your live camera movement will now be recorded. To end a shot recording, press the Escape key. For management, shots can be sorted into folders, moved between folders, renamed and deleted all from the interface. Folders can be by right clicking on them in the shot list. This current shot system is the first stage of a comprehensive cinematic toolset we ve planned out. Our goal for the future is to expand on this system by adding features such as keyframe editing, redubbing elements of shots, UI for modifying world conditions eg. weather, time of day and export options so you can render your shots into actual video or image files. Are you making videos in? Let us know how this tool can help you! AI The first phase of the AI rework is finished and it replaces multiple different AI systems across different locations with a single. Making to an established as big and complex as is scary, especially due to the multiplayer nature, so there bound to be some initial bugs. Please report anything you find and I get it fixed. The advantages of having everything running on AI system are numerous, the main being it should be easier to keep the AI updated going forwards. features will be easier to add, and they will work across all of the AI, and not just for AI in certain areas or specific monuments. So whilst there still plenty more to come in this area, there are already some features such as animal packs to look out for. IFTTT now works with IFTTT! You be able to connect to other apps, services, and devices through IFTTT to automate all kinds of tasks. For example, all of the deep sleepers who wanted to have a louder alarm can now connect smart alarms to your actual smart home alarm, your bedroom lights, and other services which support IFTTT. The IFTTT integration depends on having set up on your phone so you can pair your servers so if you are using it already, install the app on your phone! Once you all set up with you need to create or sign into your IFTTT account and head over to the service page on IFTTT where you can link to IFTTT and then build applets. The current IFTTT integration does not support controlling smart switches at the moment this is something we looking into supporting in the future. Updated Animals The animals in have sucked for far too long. They stand out more than ever now with the dropping the amazing world revamp last month. We updated them with brand models and materials, as well as a fuzzy fur shader for the longer bits of hair. This gets culled beyond so we do anticipate a big hit on performance in fact, in the process of updating we discovered each model had a lot of redundant bones which we stripped out! Along with the models came the arduous task of updating rigs, skinning animation. Some animals proved more challenging than others as the updated models correct issues in proportions of the previous models, which meant changing bone placements. Creating controller rigs for the whole suite of animals would of increased the workload by months meant every single existing animation would have needed to be replaced just to get things functional. I decided to try and the current rigs into submission for any animation updates, although as mentioned all redundant bones have been. The idles took quite a while to get something natural, but are a big improvement on what we have. I updated walks some runs where possible, but this is a baseline to build upon. I be looking to more anims, and once the ai becomes more advance we can hopefully increase their and I can start to add more animations to support this. There are current issues with some of the turn movement as well which I to improve and have a greater degree of control over.

This is the culmination of work by several people that took place on and off over the last couple of years. It greatly improves how the feels and gives it a fresh look. Most of the visuals were developed alongside the transition of the to the High Definition Render Pipeline of Unity HDRP that we subsequently dropped after unsatisfactory performance results. We didn t want to waste the efforts made to make the look better during that time and ported them to the current version of the instead. We took the opportunity in the last months leading up to this to fix a vast amount of issues revolving around monuments, world procedural generation, and exploits. For example, you find cliffs, road, terrain, river generation much improved. We some monuments completely such as the Junkyard, Satellite dish and integrated many of them inside the procedurally generated world more seamlessly than before. For example, you now see larger monuments and hubs now have bespoke subway tunnel entrances within their perimeter. When it comes to performance, we did our best to keep the current status quo or improve upon it in some areas of the. But since this adds more content than it removes, we do not expect a major improvement in performance overall. The Bandit Town is known for if not the worst performance area, and this gave us the perfect opportunity to address this. We reduced the number of NPCs, reduced the forest density and completely remodelled the huts. This is only touching the surface of, and you find many more and additions while playing. Junkyard Revamp Crane The Junkyard monument has received a complete overhaul, our original vision just did work out as well as we hoped. Once we adding flight into it only made things worse. The revamp should hopefully resolve all the commonly complained about issues and make it a hotspot for action. Not only did the Junkyard receive a complete overhaul we a driveable crane that can pick up vehicles and drop them in the shredder located at the centre of the yard. Dropping cars into the shredder will yield scrap. Moving the crane too far away from the Junkyard will destroy the crane Bush Displacement Since the HDRP content backport comes with much nicer foliage, we noticed during playtesting that bushes got in the way when building a base a lot more than with the old foliage. To counteract this, bushes are now when building on top of them. Of course bushes wo be gone forever and will automatically respawn in suitable locations around the map. This uses the same system as trees, which guarantees that a nice and even coverage across the map will be preserved and we do end up with large areas that do have any bushes at all.

Just press B by default to open the menu and look at your options. These gestures have been built to be used in first person, so you get nicely animated hand movements instead of just seeing your shadow gesture. This system for gestures is a bit more flexible than the old system, and it has already supports some future features looping animations and third person gestures. A core goal of this gesture system was reducing as much risk as possible when using them during tense gameplay. Gestures will now no longer unequip your weapon and can be cancelled at any point, with a small delay before your weapon is fireable again. Feel free to wave at your victims when roof camping! Fun fact these gestures are all because they were initially meant to be used while holding the weapon at the same time which is generally in the right hand, however we felt it limited our future options for gestures clapping with hand is tricky. As we felt that the quality of the legacy gestures were up to scratch compared to these animations, we made the decision to remove support for playing the old gestures.

Mac Improvements Over a year ago, we filed a bug report regarding Unity graphics jobs feature causing a crash on macOS after a few minutes of gameplay. This has finally been fixed and backported, so we graphics jobs on macOS. This should greatly improve performance. We incremental GC on macOS, which should reduce stalls from the garbage collector. We had issues with this feature causing huge stalls in the past, which is the opposite of what it supposed to do, so definitely contact us if you playing on macOS and you notice any stalls you did have before. Hapis We tackled the Red Keycard shortage by making them available in all corners of the island again. In addition, we a marketplace and gambling den to the Compound. Viewmodel Jitter Fix The view model jitter is finally fixed. It an issue that as old as itself and no it was on purpose. The reason that this happens is because of floating point precision, the further away from you get, the less precise things get. Pretty much every that has View Models, probably has some kind of hack to support them. In the past we did think it was worth using hacks to fix it.

HDRP boasted many visual fidelity improvements and tech, best of all it was said HDRP was more optimized resulting in better performance. Switching and updating all our assets over to HDRP was months of work but we figured it would be worth it in the end. Long story short after months of work, testing and profiling we never saw the performance gains we expected from HDRP, in fact, it was worse. Faced with this dilemma we took the difficult and long overdue decision to halt all progress on HDRP and begin to backport all the updated assets back to the current pipeline. After many more months we now at a stage we feel the backport is approaching the final stages and ready for public testing and feedback. Wednesday, April we be opening HDRP backport publically which will be available to from the Staging client via by opting into the beta branch. The backport has updated nearly all of the world objects, rocks, foliage, trees and even many monuments have received some love. Due to the nature of continued on the backport wipes will be frequent, we do not recommend regular, at least until later into the month. Mapmakers be aware a number of assets have been which may have an impact on your existing designs. If testing and feedback prove positive we be aiming to release the backport on Thursday, May. We do expect performance to be better than release but we do expect it to be worse. Easter Event For the next week, every hours hours an easter egg hunt will begin.

        "content": "This month we an underground transit system, slot machines, a round of Twitch drops and more improvements and fixes. Rail Network You now find train entrances scattered across the world, typically you find entrances next to existing monuments. Upon the first inspection, they may not appear to be anything special but after venturing inside deep below the terrain, you now find a vast rail network with drivable workcarts. When entering the train entrances you notice the huge spiral staircases penetrating deep into the terrain, central to the stairs you find a much quicker, but perhaps less safe elevator shaft. Everything in wants you dead, these tunnels are no exception. Upon reaching the bottom of the shafts you encounter some not so friendly tunnel dwellers. From this point forward you likely to encounter many more dwellers if you decide to continue exploring. With risk comes reward, while the dwellers may be unwelcoming the loot they protect could well worth the risk. After exploring the shafts and tunnels you finally be standing at the rail platform. On each platform, you encounter more dwellers but increasingly better loot. At the end of each platform, you find a driveable workcart. Consider this a first pass of a dungeon system. Everything here is procedurally generated and we plan to add track segments, bespoke entrances at each monument, puzzles, NPCs, and eventually use this system to procedurally generate the cave network. Workcarts Each station of the Freight Transit Line will have workcarts facing opposite directions. Running on Low Grade Fuel, these can be used to rapidly traverse the map. There are throttle settings forward and reverse and the vehicle will remain in operation even after you depart the cabin. You may encounter NPC barricades deep in the tunnel system. Be sure to slow down when approaching as hitting barricades or other work carts at high speeds will damage your workcart. Do worry though, when a collision is imminent, a proximity alarm will sound and you can adjust the throttle accordingly. Barricades can be broken through without damage to your cart if approached at low speed. If you encounter a track junction, you can use your left or right strafe key to choose which track to follow. Lastly, damage will slow the speed of a workcart and it can be repaired with a hammer for metal fragments. Slot Machines Test your luck with Slot Machines in the gambling room of Bandit Town. To operate the Slot Machine you need to mount it and then deposit Scrap to start betting. Each bet is Scrap and the payouts range anywhere from to Scrap. Be sure to grab your winnings and any unused betting Scrap before leaving. Good luck! Server Browser As I sure many people are aware, there are quite a few issues with the server browser. You will likely never be able to see every server out there due to the how implements this functionality, but it can be improved. I made a few internal to the server browser to improve discoverability of servers Empty servers are now hidden by default Unless you on the official, friends, history, or favorites tabs they will always be shown here Note This means you will need to enable showing empty servers sometimes The Show Empty filter will now apply filtering within This means when Show Empty is off you should see no empty servers and see more of them Toggling the Show Empty filter will a refresh of the community and modded tabs We made the tags look less terrible. We working towards a UI refresh for the server browser so the filtering will improve even more in the future. We always working on cleaning up the server list to remove servers that are spamming, advertising, or lying to try and get ahead. Server Performance Whilst looking through the server profiles recently, We noticed that certain entities were updating and sending data more than they needed to. of the biggest offenders were entities with buoyancy boats and horses. Now we try our best to not them if there are any players around or they are in use. Combining these fixes with some fixes that Jarryd made with entity flag networking, servers should handle more players a bit better both in terms of CPU and bandwidth usage. Family Share Players abusing family share to circumvent bans and other malicious behaviour is not uncommon, on February we disable family sharing for the foreseeable future. We currently have no plans to family share.

The rail network will introduce train entrances to major landmarks including the Launch Site or Military Tunnels, which you be able to easily locate on the map.

The release only mentions additional floors, so it not clear just how far you can with this but, hey, the sky the limit, right? Once you powered your elevator, you can move it floor up or down at a time using the controller respective buttons, or send it straight to the top or bottom of its shaft. You can add power inputs to your various floors which you can use to call the elevator directly to them. Neat. Just make sure you do hang around underneath the elevators when they moving.

As well as including a large pool, it includes a deck area where you can deploy other props chairs, instruments and turrets. Beach Towel The Beach Towel is a item that acts as a respawn point. While it works well on the beach and by the pool, it will work anywhere you can use a Sleeping Bag. Comes in styles so you can stand out on the beach. Beach Recliner, Parasol and Table This furniture set includes three separate props to style your above ground pool. The Recliner is a large chair where you can kick back and relax, the Parasol is a large umbrella that reduces the temperature for any players underneath it, and the Table is a small surface that goes well with the rest of the furniture.

We have a skeleton with the model on it which is what casts the localplayer shadow, the post reads. We want to show it, but we want to manipulate the bones in a way that they do conflict with the view. But if we do that the shadow would be all fucked. The solution Newman finally came up with? Rendering a different model. So what we do is basically copy the third person model which creates the shadows and manipulate the bones. The manipulation is anything complicated, it just a case of tucking shit behind the camera, Newman writes. em Above a made from video at There a couple of extra things we have to do. When you crouched and look down, we pull the viewmodel back so it does clip through your knees. While that solution does indeed look convincing from a perspective above, it both funny and a little alarming to see what happening behind the scenes to achieve it em Above a em Gif made from video at As you can see, the shadow is intact and both it and their body will look perfectly normal to them, but tucking shit behind the camera technically turns the into a weird stretched taffy monster.

Trading is a big part of surviving, and getting shot in the face while you trying to do a deal is a big part of not surviving. What a poor soul, dropped naked and alone into the midst of a cold, rocky wilderness, to do? The Compound promises to help alleviate the stresses of such business by adding a place where players can safely interact under the protective watchful eye of scientists. It will provide useful services and facilities including a refinery, workbenches, a recycler, a, and vending machines that sell basic survival resources, and a place where you can just kick back and be social if that your thing. The rules are simple No weapons, no looting, no killing, and no sleeping inside, or directly outside, the compound. Follow the rules and you can hang out to your heart content. Break them, and the scientists and their turrets will kill you dead. You be marked as hostile for five minutes and the status will persist across death, meaning you ca rush back into the compound immediately after you die The only option once you been marked is to wait it Facepunch acknowledged that the compound is probably going to be gamed pretty hard, but said that it will continue iterating on it in order to stay abreast of players trying to dick around with the system. It pointed an amusing finger at the base for forcing developers to take this step in the first place We originally intended for people to set up these kind of zones with peacekeeper turrets, but after a year and bothering we took matters into our own hands.

The boat has room for a driver and up to three passengers. Boats require low grade fuel to power their motors, and if left out in the elements a boat will decay in about three hours. If you find and want to keep it you need to build a boathouse, a post on devblog advises. Servers may spawn as many as boats at a time, so it does sound they be in terribly short supply, however. To give you a little something to do on your boat, servers will spawn floating piles of junk on the open water, so you can do some looting while you cruising around. There a compartment built into the bow of the boat to your haul. Boats can sink, naturally, if they take too much damage, but they can be repaired with a hammer, wood, and metal fragments. a You can find lots more info about Rusts boats in this post on Rustafied.",

There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you particularly industrious, you have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources the homestead necessary for any successful campaign. But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It another idiot in I do know what it is with this. Maybe it the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you spotted by an idiot, you start hearing the quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults. No has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite, and I wish I did mean that as an endorsement. It so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I did love it. I wish I could say that it did feel incredible when of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the axe I fashioned out of scrap metal which he almost certainly did know I was carrying, and put him down with a single. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I did laugh my ass off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, em Hey man, wait a second!

If it feels we been living with for a long time, that because we kinda have. The was first in Early Access in late by developers Facepunch Studios, and it been a mainstay of goofy YouTube ever since. If you somehow unfamiliar with the premise, think of as a dumber, more nihilistic Minecraft. You wake up on a map armed with only a rock and a torch. You quickly figure out that, by banging your rock on a few environmental doodads, you can harvest a few basic resources stone, wood, and cloth which you can parlay into a few prehistoric instruments, a spear or a hatchet. This is similar to the scrounging mechanics in plenty of other survival, but what makes different is how deep that tech tree goes. Eventually, from those same basic ingredients and a few mechanical leaps of faith work benches and furnaces, you be able to craft pistols, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers. famously does not quarter off its servers to keep nakeds away from the roving troops suited up in advanced firearms, which means that occasionally, your journey will end with you matching another revolver with a rock that you tied to a stick. This is the heart of. Wake up naked, run for your life, do horrible things to another. There is no grander narrative, or mythos, or win condition. Most of the servers are on a strict weekly or monthly reset schedule, which scrubs the island of any lingering housing or fortifications left behind by the players, which gives the experience a strange sense of futility. Yes, you will need to manage your hunger, thirst, and health and as you ratchet up the tech tree you will discover increasingly effective ways to stay alive but that it. Sure there are some areas on the map that are stricken with radiation, which leads to the implication that perhaps you and the rest of your misanthropes are occupying a, society, but those moments feel more window dressing than anything else. I spent the vast majority of my time in playing solo, but I do want to discount the notorious community of players that band together in clans, and wage wars of aggression along the shared hunting grounds. of the fascinating kernels of brutality is how everything in the world remains persistent, even if you logged off, which means that smart players arm their bases with land mines, punji sticks, and keypad locks while they away. Some clans even recruit players across all time zones, to make sure there always someone on guard. That a coordination I appreciated from a distance. There are a number of YouTube documentarians a showing off the raids that spawn from committed Discord channels all over the world. Instead, I engaged with the population of on a purely incidental level. An extremely geared man takes pity on you, and drops a crossbow at your quivering feet. That! A kid and I are raiding an abandoned gas station for food and weapons, and I give him the extra pair of pants I was carrying around. When I turned the other direction, he bashes his rock right through my skull and runs off with the rest of my stuff. That is. I utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. Given the tone, it should be surprising that the community I found in tended to be fairly juvenile and toxic. There a high concentration of racism and misogyny in the chat, so much so that I eventually left the channel And unsurprisingly, the experience is quite prickly. The development did spend any time cooking up a tutorial which makes some sense, when you consider how long the has been available. Instead, when you join of the many servers, you presented with a few faint hints in the corner of the screen harvest wood! build a hatchet! The crafting system itself is fairly intuitive, with tooltips for each of the items in the catalog, and you can yourself into some serious munitions if you get lucky with a few resource spawns. The PvP combat wo win any awards, but it tactile and packed with wonderfully sadist sound effects connecting your hatchet with an idiot head feels great, and, that all I needed. a There is a strange monetization model, in which you can buy ugly for your weapons and clothing. is fascinating for a hundred different reasons, but em style AWPs is of Still though, I think everyone should at least have a taste of. It hard to think of many other that are this uncompromising in its worldview, and I utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. We could build a utopia on this island! We could cast aside our weapons, and construct a peaceful commune where everyone is fed, warm, and loved. I love how Facepunch dangles that potential in front of our face, with no real incentive pushing us in any direction. If we are to dehumanize ourselves, and turn this Eden into a battlefield, we will do it on our own terms. In there is a real sense of complicitness when you eventually succumb to violence, more potent than in any other survival on the market. Despite the lack of rankings to chase, or to nurture, or exclusive vendors to unlock despite the unassailable fact that none of this will matter as soon as the server is wiped we are at war, and we always will be.",

The biggest change to accompany that transition is a graphics refresh.

He said that visual consistency had been eroded throughout development because of the need for constant, many of which did match up, so he undoing what it has become and starting afresh. In practice, what that means is improved lighting, a refresh of the colour palette and post processing, prettier rocks and foliage, and lots of types of trees dotted around the Away from graphics, the have reworked weapon recoil. Previously, your aim would sway randomly every few second while aiming. Now, it will only sway if you have fired for several seconds, so you be able to track a target and tap fire knowing that your gun is going to start jumping all over the place. This will perhaps make it easier to kill enemies if you get your hands on a rifle, although the now has slightly more recoil overall.

Please try not to compare the to some other finished or some idealized version you have in your head. Compare the now to how it was when we entered Early Access. That the that we feel qualifies us to leave Early Access, he wrote. Think of it more we leaving Prototyping and entering Alpha.

Below are, modes and mods that you should check out if you can t get enough of hunting your fellow man. Let s get the current top dog out of the way first, shall we? a, or, is still in Early Access, but it s already swallowed up the lives of millions of players. In each match, survivors are air dropped into a bucolic Russian island, seemingly abandoned during or just after the Soviet era. It s a huge place, but the area is always shrinking, forcing players to race towards safety on foot or using cars, bikes and boats, all while trying to murder each other with a wide range of guns and melee weapons. It s a filled with long moments of quiet tension, punctuated by chaotic, battles. King of the Kill Another Early Access, a King of the Kill was spun out of Daybreak s zombie survival. The survival aspect became its own separate, Just Survive, while the more competitive, PvP side of things became King of the Kill. Frenetic and, it s more of an arena shooter than a, so you won t have to wait long to get into a gunfight. Brendan Greene was a consultant on before making. Ark Survival of the Fittest, a Survival of the Fittest is another, and is similarly a. Its hook, not surprisingly given its progenitor, is that there are dinosaurs and monsters to watch out for, as well as human adversaries potentially hunting you down. Other elements from Survival Evolved have made it in, too, including riding and taming creatures, tribes and traps. Unfortunately, it s struggled to retain its playerbase in the face of. The Culling If you prefer royales of the more intimate variety, there s a Culling and its and arenas. Though it s, there s still time to craft equipment and set traps. The central conceit is a big draw, too, set as the is in a crazed show for sadists. It s been in Early Access since March, and while it was popular initially, it looks numbers might be on the wane. Last Man Standing Budget is probably the clearest way to describe a Man Standing. It s set on an island with players trying to kill each other, the area is a big circle that shrinks over time, mods can be scavenged and attached to guns, it s got loot crates there s a long list of similarities, but Last Man Standing is free. It s not quite as polished as its premium counterpart, however. MODES GTA Online, Motor Wars GTA Online recently got a competitive mode called Motor Wars, which has some similarities to popular a shrinking kill box, arriving from the sky, then finding the best weapons possible on the ground. The key difference is that it more focused around vehicle combat, and all the cars are marked on the map, as well as the players driving them. The shrinking kill space provides a similar amount of tension, though, and there tons more potential in building on the idea, given the size of the map they got to with. a had fun with it, even though it has some flaws. Fortnite Epic has announced a mode for their romp, Fortnite. It s due out this month and will see up to players duking it out until there s only left. The mode was put together by Epic s Unreal Tournament, who were busy experimenting while Fortnite was in development. The scavenging and building from the s regular mode will feature in this, so you ll be able to create bases and fortifications to hole up in while you wait for everyone else to die. They ll probably be doing the same, mind you. Unturned a is a blocky, zombie survival, but it s got a arena mode. Players are spawned at random points on the map and must hunt each other down while a barrier closes in, damaging those outside it. It s as straightforward as a can be, but there s odd wrinkle you can t damage people with your fists, so you d better get a weapon as quickly as you can. MODS s in Arma, Arma Before, Brendan Greene created, an offshoot of the original mod for Arma, inspired by the Japanese film. When players started leaving for the standalone Early Access version, Greene switched to developing a in Arma. Later, it was licensed to Daybreak for and became the foundation for King of the Kill. A lot of features started in s, and Arma s realistic aesthetic isn t far of a is an unofficial mode for Facepunch Studio s survival, made by Intoxicated. Inspired by the Arma mod, it combines the brutality of you even begin naked with the race to be the final person left alive. All the survival and crafting elements have been torn out, with the focus being entirely on gearing up and murdering your fellow players in a map that becomes smaller and smaller as bombs start to fall. Garry Mod Created last year, this a Mod mode, so many in this list, owes its creation to the Arma mod, being a lightweight recreation of it designed by so they could it with their friends. Since then, however, it s become popular, no doubt helped by the fact that Garry s Mod is considerably cheaper than Arma or",

Facepunch Maurino Berry explained in a that the to firearms three of them, are meant to address complaints that the recoil in is screwy and unfun, and collectively make the action feel a little bit more in line with traditional shooters. First, you going to notice less horizontal recoil so it be easier to maintain your target. Secondly, you going to notice that, for rifles, the first shot is pretty much dead accurate and the longer you hold down the trigger the more inaccurate it gets by way of an increasing aimcone. This means you be able to tap at targets for high accuracy or you can risk spraying more rounds down range which are less likely to hit their targets, Berry wrote. Lastly, I implemented recoil compensation. This means if you holding down the trigger and the weapon is riding up, as soon as you let of the trigger it will correct back to the original aim position. The cost of weapons have been adjusted slightly as well The Thompson now costs ten HQM high quality metal less to craft than prior to the, while the pump shotgun and laser sight cost five HQM less. Shotgun accuracy is going up a bit thanks to the discovery that accuracy cones were actually being calculated as accuracy pyramids. And if, for some reason, you do the recoil compensation feature, it can be disabled by entering false at the Other in the include the addition of drop boxes, the return of dynamic moon phases, and the start of a overhaul of Hapis Island.

He acknowledged that the sentiment may come across as dismissive, but said in a message a Reddit that it necessary to break the loop that holding the back from full I noticing a pattern, and we need to address it. It something we need to get past as a community, not only because it getting boring but because it has wider implications, he wrote. We stuck in ping pong loop. We release an, you love it for a month, you get bored, blame the system, bitch for a few months, then we release another and the same thing happens. His concern is that the pattern will persist indefinitely, because the real problem is that the systems are better than the old ones, but simply that they fresher. But Facepunch obviously ca keep overhauling the forever, and thus Newman suggests a clean break for those unhappy with. But he asked that people who do end up quitting, or who think his attitude is unfair, give thought to whether we have given you enough entertainment over the last three years to justify pocketing your before getting angry. If you interested in the, if you regularly and still get enjoyment when you we definitely interested to hear what you think. We especially love hearing your stories, watching your videos, seeing your screenshots and paintings all things that this subreddit has been very low on, Newman wrote. If we want to leave Early Access then breaking this loop has to be part of that plan. We have a pretty good idea on how to push forward with, but none of it is going to make the more appealing to people that have spent their last hours hating it. As silly as it sounds, it actually very easy to find players with more than hours in giving it negative reviews a. of them are on the front page, along with a few negative reviews of them, with more than hours on record, came about at least in part in response to Newman statement. It an unfortunate reaction, but probably inevitable, too Sooner or later, every developer has to settle on what exactly they trying to make, and no matter how good that final concept may be, somebody, somewhere, is going to be mad about it.",

        "content": "This past week brought some big to the way the survival works, including the removal of the XP and levelling system. Developer Facepunch Studios detailed why players wo level up in anymore, noting that it completely changed the feel of as a sandbox. Facepunch Maurino Berry explained how the was no longer about encounters and enjoying your time in the world, but instead about how to level up as quickly as you can. This resulted in the becoming boring once you had levelled to the max, making for an unsustainable gameplay model. items we have even thought of yet would need to be hacked into certain levels, which would cause a never ending balance nightmare and item bloat it was already ridiculous when you reach a level and have things unlocked, Berry continued. Eventually we to never have to wipe and just have decay and resource management take care of the server, XP was not compatible with this goal without all kinds of workarounds and hacks forced in some sort of prestige system. Berry concluded with the fact that XP negated the lemonade out of lemons feel that excels at, where your loadout would be consisted of whatever you could find and use. Replacing XP is the component system, which makes everything craftable from the moment you start. This means no more locked items or blueprints. However, items beyond basics require the use of a component to craft, and these can only be discovered in the world components ca be crafted. Additionally, players will see the return of radiation, which has been remixed a bit. You can more about the latest on the devblog a here. note that Berry makes is an issue where the chugs and pauses periodically. He says that if players experience this, they should press and send an error report to the developer, mentioning you experiencing the same issue highlighted in the devblog.",

        "content": "I almost glad there no knocking animation in Early Access survival crafting if there were, I be sick of watching it by now and my virtual knuckles would be bloody and full of splinters. I been knocking on forts all night, dozens of them, in an attempt to for Halloween. It not going well. It began well, though! The admin for the a Moose servers was kind enough to help me with a request a way to spawn with a mask. Cognizant of the fact that I might die repeatedly, I did want to have to do any harvesting or crafting for my costume, so she was nice enough to place a few shacks around the servers, link me to the sleeping bags within, and fill a crate inside the shack with pumpkins. This meant I could spawn in the shacks, put a pumpkin on my head, and get right to work. Sure, I was completely naked otherwise, but a costume is a costume. Content warning you can see my dong in the above image Time for! Dressed as a nude man with a pumpkin on his head and nothing else on his anything, I leave the shack and head for the nearest visible fort, making almost fifteen feet before I encounter another. This is a popular server without about people on it, and not all of them ask questions first and open fire later. I dropped so quickly I almost do realize what has happened, though luckily I got a replay the next time I spawn. And the next. And the next. At least I can see the inside of my mask each time I killed, which makes the adventure a bit more festive. I pick a different shack to spawn in, and finally get the chance to actually knock on a few doors. There no answer on any of them, but all this running around lets me admire and critique some forts. A common design theme seems to be em It A Big Box, but I see a few em It A Small Box, several em It a Box With Another Box On Top, and more than em It Part of a Box., in keeping with election season em It A At any rate, the amount of forts is impressive. The server was completely wiped not long ago, and I was a little worried there would be any forts at all. I was wrong there are tons of them. players certainly know how to build. They know how to shoot you, stab you, and bludgeon you. It a community. I knock on some more doors, but no answers. I run into a, the first I encountered who does actually murder me, and we chat for a moment. A few minutes later another goes hopping by, his dong flapping in the breeze. Gunfire echoes in a nearby valley. I see a deer and a horse and a boar. I knock on more doors, even yelling! a few times. Still, no answers. I run and knock on more doors. It begins to rain. A bald naked woman assaults me with an unlit torch, and chases me for a while before giving up. The complete lack of treats I received means I beginning to starve, and soon, I dying from lack of food. heavily armed players run by, and helpfully saves me from starvation by shooting me in the face. I hop onto the other Rusty Moose server hoping to find less bloodshed and more snacks. I visit more forts, including that looks Box forts climbed into a teleporter together and were spliced together to form a BrundleBox. I see a few wooden skyscrapers, at least Octagon, and a homeless shelter I presume for players who have built their own Boxes yet. Still, no is answering when I knock or yell! I living longer there are as many hostiles here but that just means I begin starving again. At point, I eat my pumpkin mask just to stay alive, but running around without it means I not a, I just a naked idiot. I leap from a tall structure to kill myself, but wind up just severely wounding myself, and after I writhe around screaming for a while, I respawn, put on another pumpkin, and head out for last pass. After a long night of running around with a torch knocking on another few dozen empty forts, I see a wonderful sight. It a fort, and someone home I can see a figure on the roof, outlined against the sky. Excitedly, I rush up to the door and knock. There no answer. I peer up at the roof, then knock again. Still nothing. I look up at the roof again, just in time to see the fort owner jumping off it to the ground, where he beats me to death with a rock. Before he finishes me off, I hear him munching on something. In a night spent in, it the closest I ever get to a treat. Happy Halloween.",

        "content": "SURVIVOR SERIES In survivor series we drop in on some of PC most promising survival. Today, Holly Nielsen takes her finest killing rock into. I woke up naked on an empty beach, with nothing but a rock in my hands and an unlit torch. Before I d even had a chance to stand up, someone had bashed my head in. Just before my assailant finished me off, naked people approached, killed my attacker and stood staring at me. While I waited for them to attack me too they looked down, dropped a rock at my feet, and ran away into the distance. My first minute of a was violent, brutal and oddly human. You ve probably heard of as the that people were outraged about as it randomly assigns the gender, race and sizing of your character. This online multiplayer survival has built a huge following and has developed wonderfully bizarre communities. I ve heard stories of warring factions who meet in a neutral ground ruled by a character who roleplays as the Swedish Chef from The Muppets, and people who wake up only to find themselves in a prison built by another. It s a social experiment with nudity. As with most survival the formula of gather, build, die, repeat is found here. The difference that you start stark naked with only a rock creates an vulnerability, and a feeling that you trapped in the embryonic stages of technology. Resource gathering of course involves a lot of hitting trees and rocks and wandering about in search of food and materials. Unlike many of its contemporaries and has a sense of weight. This is a welcome change to the plethora of clones on, where gathering involves little more than pawing at various objects. By gathering resources, crafting objects and killing either your fellow humans or wild animals you gain experience points which can be spent on items to craft. Eventually you ll advance from the Stone Age to automatic rifles. Progress is slow but satisfying. However, once you die you can wave goodbye to your inventory and progress. Unless you ve managed to build a storage, ideally behind locked doors and defences, your stash is either lost with you or looted by your fellow players. Death can come quickly from starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, falling, radiation or being attacked and it s surprisingly brutal when it happens. Your character screams and writhes in pain in prolonged death throes. While playing I have met almost just as many friendly players as those intent on murdering me, which can feel a rarity in online survival. While there s no singleplayer mode, there is still plenty of opportunity to focus on your own survival and settlement building. Of course there are still deathmatch servers if you fancy a spot of. The lack of lumbering zombies often a mainstay of survival, puts the focus on human interaction and all the potential for that entails. Do you run and hide, or risk exposing yourself in the hope that other players will help you out? There s an eeriness to world. Sprinkled throughout the green and often pretty environment there s abandoned industrial buildings that house valuable materials. From time to time an airplane will fly overhead and drop supply crates. These crates become a focus point leading to interactions between players that often end in death. The mysterious planes and dilapidated buildings made me reflect on the chaos happening around and how bizarre the whole thing must look from above. does take itself too seriously. Before too long my character was running about the place with mismatching wellington boots and a pumpkin on his head. Thanks to a pleasant environment design and little humorous touches the pumpkin doesn t suffer from the brown overbearing barrenness that some other survival do. The environment isn t perfect however. I have seen quite a few trees, rocks and dead bodies floating in, and textures pop in and out as you run about. Slow progression can be frustrating as you can find yourself starting again from scratch regularly. Early levelling up follows a similar line each time so you ll be repeating yourself a lot in the early stages of character growth. Fortunately the developer of, Facepunch Studios, is regularly patching and updating the. There are weekly developer blogs on the website that outline updates as well as what the are currently working on. There are regular blogs to keep players up to date on the rest off the very active community. It feels an actively growing product, rather than an unfinished that the developer occasionally patches. For that reason, and the solid amount of interesting features already currently available in its alpha state it s of the most fascinating online survival available. em Disclosure Facepunch writer Craig Pearson used to write for PCG up until about five years",

Although Garry Newman is currently working on the project, Facepunch continues to chip away at it under the supervision of lead developer Maurino Berry. of Berry recent additions a XP, which introduced a little bit of structure ie, the permanent short term goal of em grinding. Although the system was welcomed, it appears to be conflicting with the studio and the fanbase longterm vision for the. As spotted by a Berry wrote a reddit recently that, in the future, would not have XP at all. Fans on reddit and in the review section have been vocal about how the system does quite work, and Berry has recently offered his own thoughts. Basically, the system appears to mute the chaos that arises from previously more freeform and less quantitative sense of progress. As I ve said before, the XP system had huge praise until it was, and then lots of people hated it, Berry a in August. I m not deaf nor blind to this, and I m leaning towards the whole thing needing a rethink. In some ways the XP system is the antithesis of what was all about it forces players to do things in a certain order and takes away from the sandbox feeling of the. We this because people were bitching about how grindy hitting barrels and hoping for blueprints was, but I neglected to realize that the randomness could actually lead to some interesting situations and forced you to work with what you had. Berry suggestion that XP will be entirely seems a little informal, and the studio might opt to revamp it instead, but the fact that it a concern is good news for anyone whose recent falling out with the is a result of the grind.",

From now on, you be awarded points for battering things with rocks, harvesting, fishing, feeding people, and so on. In a bid to reward cooperative, you receive XP for things others accomplish using your tools or materials the system. An example is a Fish Trap, a reads the dev blog. If you make the trap but someone else uses it, you ll get XP. If you cook food and hand it to another and they eat it, you ll it earn as well. If you harvest resources and someone else uses them to craft something a hatchet, you ll earn XP. Interacting with others is the primary means of fostering multiple streams of XP. As you level up, you get a greater choice of items to spend your XP on, allowing you to carve a unique path through the upgrades rather than become a building machine. I suppose it stands to reason that person would have a hard time becoming both master fisherman and designer. Dev Facepunch warns that the feature is incomplete, so expect ongoing balancing work.",

It the first and, as far as I know, only implementation of Item Stores, a function introduced in the latest to that enables developers and community creators to sell items directly to players. The Item exists, and will continue to exist, alongside the a Market, and pricing will often be different. The Red Shine Pistol on the Item, for instance, goes for around, but costs just under on the Community Market the Forest Camo, on the other hand, costs the same on the Item but can be had on the Market for em cents. That might sound a bit sketchy, but product descriptions on the Item very visibly include the Community Market pricing as well. Part of the reason for having the market prices next to the listings is to make it clear to people if the price is lower somewhere else. Items will come and from the item, but they be available on the market as long as people are selling them, Facepunch Studios mastermind Garry Newman explained. And while the Item currently features items as a test for the system, it mainly in place for items. Newman acknowledged that the Item bears some surface similarities to the paid mods fiasco that a so much upset earlier this year, but noted that the products it sells are strictly cosmetic, and they given to players through random, timed drops in the, meaning that nobody will be excluded. I think the a on Skyrim gave a negative vision of what the future looked. Instead of showing how it would lead to better, more supported mods, it showed how you were going to be asked to pay for the shit you were getting for free yesterday, he said. Pretty much all the modders I spoken to would at least the choice to sell their mods. Personally I think they deserve to be able to make that choice themselves. It not a choice that should be made by us, or or by the neckbeards on Reddit. He expanded upon that thought in a post on his a blog, in which he said that approach is good for everyone, including people who ca, or do want to, spend money on this stuff. They hate traditional microtransactions because it s a paywall. But on they the and get random drop items, and can then sell and trade those items on the marketplace, he wrote. It s not unfeasible that a will make more money selling items than the itself cost. Newman said the backend for Item Stores has actually existed for some time now, and that as far as he knows it available to any developer who wants to use it. does partition features off for certain people, everything they add is there to be used by all developers, he said. We just agile enough to have gotten there first. I imagine it wo be the last.",

We still have some stuff to work out, making alternate clothing models for her, but if you re an admin on a server you ll be the female model, Newman wrote in the latest devblog. To clear up some confusion, when we it does live you won t get a choice of whether you re female or male. We re not the choice away from you. You never had a choice. A man s voice coming out of a woman s body is no more weird than an boy s voice coming out of a man s body. Newman confirmed in email that all admins will be set to female automatically, although that just for testing right now. And yes, other physical characteristics, sex will be assigned to specific IDs, and can not be changed. The devlog answers questions about the integration of inventory, because, Newman said, I know this shit makes people nervous. Items being to the inventory are purely cosmetic, and more significantly, Facepunch is charging for them instead, they be awarded based on playtime. There are currently no plans to sell blueprints, which he said the studio sees as more a card collecting where the cards are something you actually want, but it could happen in the future. The thing I guess to understand is that is STILL in Early Access and we need to take advantage of that fact, he wrote. This is the time for experimentation mdash because once it s not in early access we won t be able to do these kinds of changing things mdash and we ll wish we had.

Just in real life, you are who you are you can t change your skin colour or your face, a Newman wrote on devblog on March. Right now your avatar is randomised via three things. Skin colour, head mesh and head material. We only have face textures and face materials, which means there s possible combinations. We will be adding more of these later on at which point your face will probably change. On March, Newman wrote that some polish had been to faces in another, a there are still currently only four.

Balance, performance and stability is going to obviously be affected by these features so probably does make much sense to hold off on features until we get these things perfect. I hope that welcome news to everyone. It means that we have weeks where the is quite lean, as sprints long and take a couple of weeks to complete. So next week you start to see that coming through in a minor way, and over the next few months you should start seeing it coming through in more major gameplay ways. starting next week I not going to be writing these devblogs myself. The bus factor is too low right now as we saw last week, if I not around they ca get posted. So I going to encourage people to post the stuff they done themselves and get Buck to curate and post these blogs.",

What this means is that we using a different rendering mesh for models that are far away, which is lower resolution which obviously does take so much power to render. Because obviously it a waste of time rendering a highish poly model for something that will only be about pixels tall on the screen. We done a lot of work on serverside performance. The AI now thinks at a fixed rate. Previously it tried to think every frame. Race Face Everyone now has a pseudo unique skin tone and face. Just in real life, you are who you are you ca change your skin colour or your face. It actually tied to your steamid. Right now your avatar is randomised via three things. Skin colour, head mesh and head material. We only have face textures and face materials, which means there possible combinations. We will be adding more of these later on at which point your face will probably change. There a lot of skin colours in the world, and it easy to appear racially insensitive when doing this. This is compounded by the fact that everyone is used to seeing this guy as a white guy, so when you see him as a black guy it feels he just blacked up. So we spending a lot of time trying to lessen that effect. There still work to be done, so consider this just the boilerplate of an idea for now. It quite pleasing to see different races working together in, and makes you realise how arbitrary race is. Building Enhancements Vince has been doing a lot of work on the building pieces, having fun with the conditional models to make things appear more natural. I changed the conditional model system so it only runs on model that are close to the, instead of previously where it be running the logic on buildings that were a mile away, and not prioritising nearby buildings at all. This meant that more often than not you were never actually seeing the conditional models.

I had to put a bunch of logic in for the stairs placement so that they up or down depending on which side of the placement you are.

A bit of work was done to make the guide more reliable, to fix problems when it turns red and floats towards the, or staying attached even when you walked quite far away. The building sidewards trick that people were using to build skybridges was fixed. Roof blocks do require to be placed on a floor anymore, you can just attach them to a wall. Vince has made the roof block even more awesome by giving it a vaulted ceiling. Ragdoll Fixes Ragdolls were copying their bones from their parent. This was making stuff look laggy as when the ragdoll spawned the would still be visible, and the ragdoll would spawn in their default stance. This is fixed now so things look a bit more natural. Fog We changed how fog worked to give a better sense of distance. Previously the dog was only showing up in the far distance which looked great in certain situations but it meant that it was hard to get a sense of distance.

Most of those should be fixed now, though improving the road network generation is still an ongoing process. We an initial version of bridges which are very much still a work in progress but help keep landmarks connected. With roads doing the right thing for the most part we felt experimental and a proof of concept for rivers. On the hand rivers are great because everyone wants them and they do a big deal to make landscapes look unique. On the other hand rivers are horrible because they come with all sorts of issues that have to be addressed with workarounds that are more or less ugly. They cause between the river mesh and the terrain mesh, fuck around when the terrain mesh LODs and make checks for whether or not something is underwater an order of magnitude more complex. Nonetheless we decided to run with it and rivers to the procedural maps. There s bound to be issues with this first iteration for you re not getting wet when crossing rivers but we ll solve those as we along. A nice side effect of having proper rivers that flow down slopes is that they allowed us to remove a lot of the water at zero level which was previously supposed to kind of look rivers but didn t. This allows for much more terrain elevation and gives us much more freedom when designing the procedural generation. example of this is a huge increase in the number of mountain lines, simply because we have much more space available for them. The terrain shape gives us a lot more freedom when texturing the terrain. Biomes now depend on both the latitude how far north or south a position is as well as the altitude how high a position is, leading to much more detail and variety overall. Further include a warehouse landmark, bigger and more condensed rock clusters, improved sand dunes, nicer mountaintops, smoother texture blending and many more I ve probably forgotten. Packet Errors When we first moved to Raknet were getting occasional problems with entities being missing on the client. The server was sending them but they were showing up. Investigation found that the entities were reaching the client but we had a lot of invalid packets. I a checksum to the entity networking process. Players that were missing entities got kicked. The assumption was that these were network issues, maybe people were on a shit internet connection. But then a lot of people started getting kicked. And it was the same people. The main reason for moving to Raknet was that it a tried and tested platform, so any bugs were going to be in my code. So I spent hours ripping my code to bits, putting it back together in a different order. No change. So maybe it some other code overwriting the memory that contains the packets, so I disabled any other native code we had running which could be a problem. No change. So maybe it some compiler flag in our native dll, maybe it a raknet define, maybe we sending too much data and raknet is tested for it. All no change. After reading through lots of feedback from you guys thanks, I spotted a pattern. It was happening when the packet was larger than the MTU the maximum size of information that fits in a single packet, so it was only happening when the packet had to be split. I set up a bunch of logging which confirmed it. Some packets were split and put back together again, and the that errored out was put back together but we received the last peice first. But surely raknet would handle that right? Surely it would put shit back together in the right order? Nope. We had no more issues with the dev servers since I applied a fix to this, but I be keeping my eyes open. Sound Updates Alex Rehberg We ve tweaked volume levels and finished moving everything over to the sound system, which gives us a lot more control over how things are played back. We ve started working on filtering sounds as they move farther away from the camera so that distant gunshots and explosions actually sound different. Moving underwater will splashing sounds and muffle the rest of the audio now. You are already connected There was a network issue where if you were kicked from a server you were actually. This meant you could rejoin the server because it thought you were already on there and the count did down. Lerp Bug I dropped the ball. If you thought the last version was laggy it was probably because of this. I was converting ping from seconds to milliseconds when working out the lerp. Luckily it was clamped, but you would have noticed that movements were lagging about half a second behind where they were instead of pingtime. Thanks to bilford for pointing this out. Animal Attacks It should be more obvious when you being attacked by a wolf now because it show the damage indicators on the screen indicating the direction. Dying is still something that sucks right now. Flashing to the you dead screen is ideal, hopefully that be made better next week. Reinforced Grade Vince has finished off the reinforced building grade. The idea here is that the reinforced grade is the top tier, and combines the properties of wood, stone and metal. We want to get into a position where wood, stone and metal are chosen linearly, but they chosen for their specific properties, but choosing reinforced brings the best of all those properties. It going to take some time to jiggle that plan out, but that what we heading for. Exploits The gamma exploit is a long standing problem, and not that is easily fixed. We testing something out that makes it a lot more useless. When something gets dark now we just cut the colour off and draw it black. We lose a bit of image fidelity here, but it means that everyone is on the same level and you do have to feel to the all washed out just because everyone else is.

        "content": "Thursday Dev Blogs Updates Remember how we used to release patches on a Friday and then changed to Monday. Well, we changing it to Thursdays, alongside the devblog. The problem with Friday updates is that we lose our weekends because we fixing bugs and in turn that ruins your weekends of playing because bugs unfixed, or we while you playing restarting servers and in the worst cases wiping. The problem with Monday updates is that we tell you what in it on Friday. If there going to be a wipe then playing over the weekend feels a waste of time because all your progress is gone on Monday. And wants to jump on the dev branch because the dev servers are unstable as we need to wipe a lot when testing. So it good for. So we trying Thursday. Close enough to the weekend to give everyone something fresh, far enough away that we can any breakers. We moving the devblog here too because that just makes good sense. Bootstap Error A lot of users were getting a bootstrap error where the would load, it just sit at the bootstrapping screen. This was something blowing up in Unity Analytics. I put a try catch around it, so we should be protected from that now. Animal Hide Clothing Xavier animal hide clothing has made it in. We have boots, a vest, pants and a poncho. There some incompatibilities with the poncho and the vest when wearing them together terrible zfighting but I nudged xavier about it and hopefully something can be done. Footsteps Alex has been playing with the footsteps. He replaced all the sounds, and a bunch of variations for running and crouching. He some a lot of tweaking to avoid playing the sounds when they should be played. I sure a lot of people will be glad to hear that footsteps created by the local are quieter and are played in so it does sound someone is running around you in circles. Metal Tier Vince has done an awesome job on the metal tier. The price and health of all of the blocks have all been balanced to suit the tier and blocks are all wood anymore when you hit a metal block you get sparks, when you hit a stone block you get dust just you expect. Raknet We changed the networking system to use Raknet. This is likely to have fixed a bunch of networking issues people were having, and it even more likely to have created some ones. Raknet is a common networking library which was bought by Oculus and made open source. The main difference between it and Lidgren which we were previously using is that Raknet is coded in, whereas Lidgren is coded in C. Some people will suggest that this should give us a massive performance boost, but I do agree with that, but it definitely should be slower. But we might see other benefits in terms of garbage collection. Raknet is a tried and tested solution so if something is fucking up then we know it our fault and it fixable. That is something we had with Lidgren. This has been a good chance to clean the networking system up in general. We had a few different functions to do the same thing, and some systems that were seriously. Those have all been cleaned up now. Please let us know if this made things worse or better for you! EAC have been patching in the background. We were seeing problems with an error about, that fixed. You should be able to on Windows now. It probably a good time to explain why we have these EAC guys working at this instead of doing it ourselves. We did get into development to fight these battles. Having a bunch of guys who specialise in this kind of stuff means we can concentrate on development. Which is where we should be focusing all of our attention. And so far it working. There are hacks for there always are going to be. But there are a lot less hacks for the current version than there were for Legacy. Something I been considering lately. There are situations where someone will find an exploit, or a way around EAC, and they keep it a secret.

Melee Raiding Balancing Internally we been looking at how we can better balance the melee vs buildings stuff. When we tweaking these values it can be hard to comprehend just what effect they will have. So we been creating some tools to help us preview exactly what happening. This has lead to a bunch of balances on the melee weapons. I appreciate this is data that the community would to get their hands on and there pros and cons to that. Ultimately the data will be extracted some way or another, and having a bunch of eyes on it guarantees that there less fuckups. But at the same time it takes some of the mystery away from the, and any change we make is immediately flagged up and reviled against.

Metabolism The metabolism has been working for a while. This means you have died of hunger for a long while. It enabled again now, so you can die of starvation and thirst. The rules are very simple right now. If you have lower than calories or thirst you lose health. If you have over calories or thirst you will gain health. Calories and thirst drop a minute. So if you have calories right now, you have about hours real world time to eat before you start losing health. The part of the metabolism does take into account movement heartrate or heat or anything that right now. This is on purpose to see how we feel about the rates before adding other factors. Localized Damage A while back we had a system where if you shot someone in the head it do more damage than if you shot them in the toe. Then some internal refactoring happened and it did get.

        "content": "Thursday Dev Blogs Updates Remember how we used to release patches on a Friday and then changed to Monday. Well, we changing it to Thursdays, alongside the devblog. The problem with Friday updates is that we lose our weekends because we fixing bugs and in turn that ruins your weekends of playing because bugs unfixed, or we while you playing restarting servers and in the worst cases wiping. The problem with Monday updates is that we tell you what in it on Friday. If there going to be a wipe then playing over the weekend feels a waste of time because all your progress is gone on Monday. And wants to jump on the dev branch because the dev servers are unstable as we need to wipe a lot when testing. So it good for. So we trying Thursday. Close enough to the weekend to give everyone something fresh, far enough away that we can any breakers. We moving the devblog here too because that just makes good sense. Bootstap Error A lot of users were getting a bootstrap error where the would load, it just sit at the bootstrapping screen. This was something blowing up in Unity Analytics. I put a try catch around it, so we should be protected from that now. Animal Hide Clothing Xavier animal hide clothing has made it in. We have boots, a vest, pants and a poncho. There some incompatibilities with the poncho and the vest when wearing them together terrible zfighting but I nudged xavier about it and hopefully something can be done. Footsteps Alex has been playing with the footsteps. He replaced all the sounds, and a bunch of variations for running and crouching. He some a lot of tweaking to avoid playing the sounds when they should be played. I sure a lot of people will be glad to hear that footsteps created by the local are quieter and are played in so it does sound someone is running around you in circles. Metal Tier Vince has done an awesome job on the metal tier. The price and health of all of the blocks have all been balanced to suit the tier and blocks are all wood anymore when you hit a metal block you get sparks, when you hit a stone block you get dust just you expect. Raknet We changed the networking system to use Raknet. This is likely to have fixed a bunch of networking issues people were having, and it even more likely to have created some ones. Raknet is a common networking library which was bought by Oculus and made open source. The main difference between it and Lidgren which we were previously using is that Raknet is coded in, whereas Lidgren is coded in C. Some people will suggest that this should give us a massive performance boost, but I do agree with that, but it definitely should be slower. But we might see other benefits in terms of garbage collection. Raknet is a tried and tested solution so if something is fucking up then we know it our fault and it fixable. That is something we had with Lidgren. This has been a good chance to clean the networking system up in general. We had a few different functions to do the same thing, and some systems that were seriously. Those have all been cleaned up now. Please let us know if this made things worse or better for you! EAC have been patching in the background. We were seeing problems with an error about, that fixed. You should be able to on Windows now. It probably a good time to explain why we have these EAC guys working at this instead of doing it ourselves. We did get into development to fight these battles. Having a bunch of guys who specialise in this kind of stuff means we can concentrate on development. Which is where we should be focusing all of our attention. And so far it working. There are hacks for there always are going to be. But there are a lot less hacks for the current version than there were for Legacy. Something I been considering lately. There are situations where someone will find an exploit, or a way around EAC, and they keep it a secret. Would it be a good idea to start a kind of reward system where people revealing ways around our solutions would get a cash reward for reporting unreported exploits?

        "content": "Roads and Reloads Roads Andre got roads in! Roads connect landmarks and rad towns. You can walk on them. This is still in the stage, but since it got to work in millions of different procedurally generated maps we thought it was best to get it in and find any problems as soon as possible. Reloading I started making a crazy reload system. Holding R bought up a reload menu, showing your weapon and all the types of ammo that could fit in it. Left clicking an ammo pile would add of that type to your gun, right clicking would fill it with that type. This meant that you could have more granular control over filling your weapon, and when we have different ammo types you could alternate them in your clip. Then we realised that it was all a big load of shit, and would ever want to do any of that. So I just changed it to be normal reloading. Goosey had already made reload animations for everything so it already cool as fuck. Item System A while back we thought would it be cool if all our items were on a website, so we could all edit them easier, and even people who are programmers and do have Unity could edit them and fill stuff out. And then maybe our artists could upload models and materials, and then it would all be downloaded in the and just work. Then eventually we could open it up to the public so anyone could make items, and people could vote on the items and we put the best ones in. We fell into the premature generalization problem here. We were making a system before we knew completely what it was, how it would be used, how it could be used. The items are defined in Unity now. This means that when we want to add a item we just create a copy of the existing item, change a few text entries and it done. In the old system we have to to the site, create a item, fill shit out, to the, download the item definition, then if something was wrong, repeat. There a bunch of reasons why it better now, but they reasons only we care about. For you it means that I spent days making us more agile. Compile Issues We were fighting compile issues for a few days. This meant that the dev server were mostly inaccessible during this time. The problem it turned out was that we had too much stuff. The resources file in the Unity build had a limit, and we were going over that, which resulted in a cryptic error. The hacky solution, it turned out, was to make a scene that had a reference to all the textures, and a scene that had a reference to all the sounds. This made the a lot smaller because it did contain any of those. Shortly after the on Monday EAC enabled the file hashing stuff, which successfully stopped the resource editing stuff that was going on. If you were using this cheat you probably need to verify your content to the version of the files, so it will let you again. At the moment Windows is classed as a cheat. The EAC guys are working on that. Unity Analytics Again, another thing for us more than you. We our Google Analytics implementation and Unity Analytics. Analytics is a funny word to spell, the trick is to remember to start with anal. Unity Analytics only supports iOS and Android right now, because hardly any PC are made with Unity. But we using it anyway. We not doing anything particularly interesting yet, just useful general stuff the number of players, memory usage and the average framerate. Sprint Instead of having to let of sprint for a split second to use your melee weapon and then being able to sprint again, we changed it so trying to use your melee weapon will automatically make you stop sprinting for a very small amount of time. This has the benefit of making melee less hectic as well as more user friendly. Item Condition Gathering Helk has has changed how items lose condition when gathering, and how gathering works. Now each weapon defines explicitly how it behaves when it hits an object, such as how much to get, how much it wastes, and how much damage the item should take. The balance values aren t final and are subject to change but what this does is give us a lot more flexibility to make each tool behave how we see fit. In addition, instead of gathering giving you some of each type of resource contained in the object, it will dispense only type of item at a time. Harvesting will still take the same amount of time as it did before but you ll get less resource spam and more of each individual type per hit. Development Thread We have a thread on our forums where you can post bugs and discuss the development branch. The idea is that this is the place to flag up bugs and problems with stuff on the development branch, so we can look into it and fix it before making it live. This is a thread for suggestions, ideas, bugs in the live branch that you have verified exist in the development branch. Overall Balance I hate that I have to post this every week, but people think we think the balance is perfect if I do. The balance is perfect, do worry, it an ongoing thing. Everything Else Canned food now gives you an empty can when eaten Empty cans can be smelted into metal fragments in campfires! Stone spear now costs a wooden spear plus some stone Sleeping bag now costs cloth instead of Lantern consumes fuel Summary Kind of a slow week. We got some good stuff done, but apart from the roads and the reloading you not going to see any benefits to it. Again, we posted in last week we not releasing an today. It will probably come out on early next week and bad news this requires a total wipe of saves and blueprints. Server owners do have to worry because this happens automatically but I think we got a responsibility to tell you that it gon na happen before it does. Wipes are something we want to avoid as much as we can. Which is of the reasons we thinking about increasing the length of our sprints to or three weeks between updates.

        "content": "Sprint Cycle We making this week. We no longer going to release updates on a Friday, because it stupid. We going to be pushing our out on Mondays. The devblog will stay on Fridays. The aim is to have it all ready by Friday on the dev branch, so that the early adopters that have joined the dev branch can test it all weekend, then we can fix any last remaining bugs before making it live on Monday. Which then gives us better opportunities to fix bugs during the week. What we want to do is encourage more people to join the dev branch, so our stuff gets tested more before being pushed to the main branch. Raiding Balance We the automatic health regen on building blocks. Freshly placed building blocks now have full health and upgrading a block gives it full health. You can repair a block with the hammer but it going to cost you a fraction of the resources. Twigs We have a tier of building. It called the tier. It weak and it cheap. The idea is that you can quickly and cheaply lay your building out before proceeding to upgrade it. These blocks are very weak so if you make a mistake it does take long to smash to pieces. Durability We bought back durability in legacy. The idea behind durability is that it will punish you more if you using a weapon wrong. For example, if you using a hatchet to try to break down a stone wall it will wear out a lot faster than if you using a pickaxe. This should make it more challenging for hatchet raiders, especially if you have upgraded walls. Because this is a big change please do expect the balance to be perfect straight from day. It something we going to watch and nudge the values around until it works. Pump Shotgun, Goosey, Alex and Helk have done an awesome job bringing the pump shotgun to the. It feels meaty to use, something from the original Quake. Timed Explosive To make raiding more possible in the higher tiers, and to meet our baseline goals, we have back explosives. The exact ingredients required to make explosives and the charge still need balancing, but the basics are all in. We not sure whether tossing it will stay, or whether you have to up and place it. Ambient Sound Alex ambient sound system is in! Currently it factors the biome you in and the time of day. There a base layer of ambience for each biome and a collection of off sounds that are randomly triggered to break things up a bit. The map no longer feels an empty world, it feels a world that is full of stuff. Gibbing Late in the week we worked out the foundations of gibbing. This is something we were sorely missing, and something that was going to get harder and harder to implement the longer we left it. Vince made some test gib models and I hooked it up. And it works! These gib models are they were just made to test the theory of the system. We can start working our way through the models now, creating gibs for them. Movement There been a couple of to movement. You can no longer sprint sidewards, diagonally or backwards. And you ca use your weapons while sprinting. This brings the movement in line with Legacy and it makes melee fights more feasible and interesting. It gives you an opportunity to bitch about how the movement in Legacy was terrible and this is a step backwards, even though you posted the exact opposite thing a month ago. Other Stuff Fixed stopping when closing inventory menu Fixed chat box opening again on submit Chat has scrollable history Can click on avatars in chat to view profile Fixed too many vertices in canvas error if lots of chatting Fixed cancelling queue craft not returning resources Crafting can no longer take from or give to wearables slots Items are not destroyed if inventory is full they dropped into the world If is full, will spit out items instead of losing them drop notice options to hide Can toggle nudity censor in menu menu settings are now saved properly roof block Fixed supply drop parachute not closing explosives timed explosive charge Voice UI unique loot panels Can now loot corpses clothing Building Privilege UI notices Fixed damage info being sent to the delayed low overlay radius to some projectiles arrows, shotgun pellets easier to hit Fixed scrollwheel not skipping over items that can t be held Summary My main hope for this week was that I could get some of the issues with the UI fixed. But then we got a bit more ambitious. A lot of gameplay stuff. A lot of that are making our lives simpler. And a lot of stuff. We aware that some of the stuff we is balanced. Balancing is something that we can get right on the first release. It something that gets normalised through playing and iteration. So please do be the guy who freaks out on reddit. Next week more of the same. I hoping to get the network system transitioned to raknet which should fix a bunch of network related problems people are having and will probably add some ones that people are having right now.",

        "content": "The With The UI UI System We have switched over to Unity UI system. It not without its problems which they working on but it a lot better than it was. While I moved the majority of stuff over, please keep in mind that this is just under weeks of work. I have been concentrating on moving over the most important or most complicated features. So there are things missing which I working on. Menu Screen We want to make the menu screen less useless. We do want it to be a screen that you use to get to another screen, we want to use it to keep you informed. You can see a tiny example of this now, as we link to the latest devblogs. Server Browser The server browser is a bit more comprehensive than the previous version. We have lists for LAN servers, favourites and history. You can add a server to your favourites by pressing the star next to its name. UnityUI is a bit slow at handling massive lists right now they looking into it, so I limited the server lists to showing the top servers. I be adding filtering and searching tools at some point. Connection Screen A screen. The connection screen shows the connection status. If you disconnect from a server it will show you why. If you press escape in and come to the menu, you be able to use it to disconnect. This screen a bit if a placeholder. I hoping to add more features to this screen that let you have more interaction with the server. Think logos, MOTD, admin lists, connection stats ping etc, reporting. Death Screen The death screen is now skipped if you never been alive before. The left side is a bit empty right now but that change over the next few weeks. The right side should show respawn options. You can now choose which sleeping bag you want to spawn on. If you ca spawn in a sleeping bag because of a time delay, it show how long until you can use it right on the button. You can give your sleeping bags a friendly name in. Sleep Screen The sleeping screen no longer has a wake up button. You can just press a button to wake up instead. Inventory The inventory menu is now full screen and frameless. This has the disadvantage of obscuring all the stuff that happening in the background, but it has the advantage of not looking shit. It might be a bit big on larger resolutions. Next week I be adding some scaling options so you be able to make it smaller based on your preference. Selecting Items You can select an item by clicking on it. This will show information about the item at the top of the screen, along with any options it may have eating food. This area is right now but we have plans that justify its existence. You drop items using this method. I can appreciate that this sucks, next week I add options to drag out of your inventory to drop. Splitting Splitting has changed, and it something you need to be taught. If you select a stack you get a split widget. Simply drag the bar to the amount you want to take, then drag the icon to where you want to put it. But that not all Left mouse button dragging a stack drags the whole thing Right mouse button dragging drags a single item Middle mouse button dragging drags half the stack It our belief and hope that the three clicks required to split accurately is offset by the fact that you probably never actually do that, opting instead of use the mouse buttons. But we see how it works out. Blueprints The blueprints list have an All category. They show how many you have unlocked. You can scroll through the list by dragging it up and down. The items you ca craft because of a lack of resources are at the bottom, the rest are ordered by title. When you are crafting something a timer will show up, along with how many others are queued. You can cancel an item you have queued by right clicking. This is a lot more simplified compared to the previous version and you do lose a degree of control but we see how it goes. Tweaks The tweaks window has been redesigned and has a few options. It shows the framerate, and has a framerate graph along the bottom. This should make it easier for you to see if changing the settings here has any performance benefit. I am noticing now that the grey background gradient is horrible, so I tweak that next week. Let me know what other options you want here. Chat Chat now has avatars and names are a different colour. Next week I need to add history and fix that white line at the bottom of all of the avatars. Vitals Nothing much has changed with vitals. Some of them show a bit more accurate data. That it. Randomized Rad Town Layouts We are currently testing a system to partially randomize rad town and monument layouts based on the server seed. You can look at it as a simplified version of the AI Director in Left Dead. It can for example remove or add walls, buildings or other objects from rad towns to make it harder for people to learn the exact layout and loot positions. The aim is to people to always be prepared for surprises when entering a rad town, even if they have seen this specific rad town type before. For now we are using this system very scantily in order to test that everything works as it should. At this stage it is little more than a proof of concept to see what kinds of randomizations could make sense when we design rad towns in the future, but expect to see or not see some rad town entrances and objects depending on which server you are playing on. Anti Cheat EAC has been turned off for the last week while the guys debugged why people were seemingly being kicked randomly. They done that now so it back armed. Some guys have found that you can fuck about with the big resources file to create cheats. I could have spent time writing code to stop that, but the EAC guys are working on a better, more solution for that, which should be ready quite soon. Summary Man, that been a bit of a crunch for the last couple of weeks but it feels great to have got it all done. I going to spend next week cleaning it all up, fixing bugs, adding back missing features and taking feedback. I the Raknet source code to our native dlls too all ready to be used so I have a at that too which should fix some of the network issues we had with lidgren. Let me know about any you have with the UI either via garrynewman or in the forum.",

        "content": "The With The UI UI System We have switched over to Unity UI system. It not without its problems which they working on but it a lot better than it was. While I moved the majority of stuff over, please keep in mind that this is just under weeks of work. I have been concentrating on moving over the most important or most complicated features. So there are things missing which I working on. Menu Screen We want to make the menu screen less useless. We do want it to be a screen that you use to get to another screen, we want to use it to keep you informed. You can see a tiny example of this now, as we link to the latest devblogs. Server Browser The server browser is a bit more comprehensive than the previous version. We have lists for LAN servers, favourites and history. You can add a server to your favourites by pressing the star next to its name. UnityUI is a bit slow at handling massive lists right now they looking into it, so I limited the server lists to showing the top servers. I be adding filtering and searching tools at some point. Connection Screen A screen. The connection screen shows the connection status. If you disconnect from a server it will show you why. If you press escape in and come to the menu, you be able to use it to disconnect. This screen a bit if a placeholder. I hoping to add more features to this screen that let you have more interaction with the server. Think logos, MOTD, admin lists, connection stats ping etc, reporting. Death Screen The death screen is now skipped if you never been alive before. The left side is a bit empty right now but that change over the next few weeks. The right side should show respawn options. You can now choose which sleeping bag you want to spawn on.

Previously you always find boxes in the same position and most of the time they were empty. Now the boxes disappear when they are looted and respawn at a random position. We ve modified the loot tables quite a bit to be slightly more generous when it comes to boxes in rad towns. You will notice that Rad Towns spawn barrels at random positions. This means no more dummy barrels! There are different tiers for the barrels, some with better, some with worse loot. Updated Terrain Generation Terrain generation was updated with sand dunes including a sand texture, small lakes and steep cliff. The overall terrain resolution was increased by a factor of four, which allows for more details in both the heightmap and ground texturing. The updated procedural generation algorithm provides a lot more control parameters, which means we ll have a much easier time to address terrain layout issues in the future. In addition to the improved terrain shape, the server now spawns around four to five times as many trees per world unit by default and a much higher percentage of the overall landmass is turned into forest. Bush density was greatly increased and they no longer disappear a few hundred metres away but instead turn into billboards that can be seen from any distance. Last but not least, radtown placement was improved to fit the surrounding terrain in a smooth and more way. Join Timeouts If you have a crappy internet connection you probably have been able to join a server in the last couple of weeks. I been looking at it and I hoping I made stuff better for those guys but at the moment it does seem to be a universal problem with Lidgren. I keeping an eye on it and will evaluate our options once I done with the UI stuff. Satellite dish Vince has finished work on the satellite dish monument! It got a lot more rusty. Admin Commands We started a secret chat room for server owners to give us feedback, so have made a few based on that. All of the admin commands should now give a confirmation response. So if you add a moderator, it should now tell you that it completed successfully. removemoderator steamid removeowner steamid unban steamid Let us know if there are any other admin features you would. I do want us to get into a situation where you feel you have to install server mods to moderate your server. UI Progress I been spending all week on the UI. It not ready yet. My plan is to have it ready for early next week, then put it on the development branch for testing and then release it to main on. I have been having a lot of fun doing the UI. Unity UI system is totally without its issues, but I confident in saying it the best I ever used. Summary We resisted putting out patches during the week because they were going to require a wipe so hopefully the I put out after typing this does have any big problems. Something to be aware of is that even though the requires a wipe, it does need to wipe your blueprint progression. So that something at least.

        "content": "Radtowns and Blueprints Mass Drops We had a long standing problem with mass drops on our servers. After about people have joined, and after a few hours, every few minutes everyone on the server would drop out. This turned out to be a problem with how Lidgren our low level network library recycles packets. The list of packets was growing that large at times that it was affecting performance of the network thread which periodically stalled and stopped sending out data, causing clients to eventually give up and disconnect. This is another of those bugs that we been chasing our tail on for a long time unsure whether it was something we were doing or a ddos attack. It could have probably been avoided completely by using a tried and tested networking library from the start but I guess this is how network libraries become tried and tested. Missing Lock Weirdness This is a tricky to explain, so I not going to bother. Sometimes on the client locks that we on doors were actually showing on the door, they show at the center of the world instead. And sometimes when saving we lose the fact that the lock was attached to the door. This meant that when loading that save the lock would stay on the door but the door did know it was there so did use it. Meaning anyone could open the door. This is fixed. Finally. Jacket Xavier got a bunch of jackets in. For now we only put in the because we do have UI to handle reskins yet, but there a lot of verirty there for the future. Assault Rifle Paul,, Goosey and Helk have got the assault rifle in. It an, but I do think we calling it that in for some reason. Maybe because it got a shovel handle. Bear Trap Will kill animals and players, should be fun to see how this plays out with base defense, eventually it ll actually trap things instead of kill them but lets see how this plays out, corpses of any object that trip it will stick around for quite a while so you can revisit your traps and see what they caught! Airdrop Fixed The airdrop was dropping an impotent package right in the middle of the map. The package it drops is now potent, and it drops it somewhere randomly on the map. The package has higher value loot than can be found in the other loot spots, and you do have to pay for it. Blueprints legacy, you now start with the limited ability to craft items. You need to find and study blueprints to be able to craft items. We still tweaking which blueprints you start with and which you have to find so please let us know. The blueprint data is decoupled from the map save data. So if your server administrator likes, he can wipe the map but keep your blueprint states. In the future I want to look at making the way this data is saved my available to server mods so server providers with multiple servers can share data between them. Radtowns Let me start by saying that this is all placeholder art. We got a bunch of models from the asset and put them together. We figuring out what works and what makes sense using this placeholder art before fully committing to creating our own art. We want more internals, we want you to be able to enter any building you see. The towns work very much in legacy. There buildings, there respawning loot, there radiation. Things might look a bit weird initially because we still experimenting with telling the procedural system how and where to place these, and to modify the terrain around them so they look they been there for a long time. We have big ideas for Radtowns. Random Loot Barrels This is a bit of a placeholder which will be once we have more loot spawning monuments. Around the map you find barrels spawn randomly. Break them to get their contents which can be items or blueprints. This is part of the radtown strategy to give people more of a purpose to roam the island, and make it possible to acquire blueprints. They wo be barrels forever. Everything Else Aiming down the sight provides a recoil reduction, crouching further reduces recoil, weapons have higher recoil in general now Bolt rifle now has no aimcone bullet goes where you aim gravity Fixed corpses not spewing their contents when destroyed Fixed bug where lootables could become permanently occupied Fixed code lock not displaying its status in the world Fixed unducking when opening menu Tweaked how positions were updated over the network clients should get more up to date information now Linux Many apologies to the linux guys. There a bug currently affecting the current Unity Beta that is causing a crash on startup. Hopefully this will be fixed in next week, all we can do right now is apologise and let you know we are thinking about you. Summary An awesome week. We flying now, making some great progress. The is definitely fun to again right now. When we are getting EAC and Auth Timeouts the servers are performant and stable even with players. This is all awesome. Next week, bug fixes and balancing.

The first priority on the list, for instance, but not necessarily the number priority is Working Blueprints, which includes Blueprint Distribution,, and Limits Blueprint Distribution devolves further into Radtown Monuments and Item, while Limits branches to Unlocked Blueprints, Send Unlocked Blueprints, and Limit Item Creation Via Blueprints. There much more to it than just that mdash it a big document with a lot of ideas on it. But it should be seen as ten tablets of stone handed down from God, as Newman put it. It a rough, scatterbrain plan of our intentions and direction. everything we do, it and evolves. Facepunch recently a a to that shifted its focus from building to exploration.",

Facepunch Studios is aware that many players spend a lot of time, maybe em too much time, hammering their abodes together in the survival adventure, so a forthcoming with streamline the process. This means you probably spend more time exploring and gathering resources than,, hammering. Apparently some people are happy about the though. Not enough hammering. I ve seen a few people comment that they don t understand why we re changing the build system, Garry Newman writes in a a devblog. They loved it, it was miles better than legacy, don t change it, please god don t change it. Well you probably should have said something before because all I ve heard is moaning. Once the are live, players will have a lot less hammering to do. According to Newman, resources rather than time should be the payment for building, and as a result exploration and gathering will be a stronger focus. Anything we can do to encourage players to explore, we should, Newman writes. Another reason is that the art cost was too high. Every component needed different stage models wood,, stone, etc, this is a lot of art especially when you consider that things stairs don t need that. The system keeps these requirements low while allowing for the maximum customizations. The full notes are a here.",

But Garry Newman, the man behind indie darlings Garry Mod and, says he do exactly the same thing if he could, and you probably would too. Newman pointed out in a blog post that went up shortly after the Mojang deal was was confirmed that everything for an indie developer once he starts hiring people to work for him, because you suddenly responsible for a lot more people than just yourself. Citing the case of Blitz Studios, which shut down in September, laying off employees, and then effectively in November under a name, he wrote, Those are the guys you do want to be. I am sure more than the top guys at Mojang became very financially rich due to this deal and that something that should be admired not seen as a bad thing, he continued. Long story short, I d have done the same thing. The money is enough to very much take care of all the staff. The is in relatively safe hands. Mojang s legacy is as a huge success story instead of a hit wonder. Everyone wins. Can you seriously say you d have done it differently? No, Garry. No, I can not.",

Deuce working title is being described as tennis crossed with Street Fighter and OK, we going to have to examine that a little bit. Expect characters, themed arenas and extravagant special moves for instance, a teleport power that swaps the direction of the ball. Andy Murray sullen head perks up in interest. Deuce appears to be developer Ian James baby, so do expect Garry Newman or, indeed, Gary Numan to suddenly divert all of Facepunch resources to this newest project. Meanwhile, Gary Numan is probably working on an album or something. The fact that is in Early Access does muddy the waters a little bit, but development teams work on multiple prototypes all the time just usually in secret. Here how Deuce is looking at the moment, from Ian post So far I ve pretty much got a functional tennis with some placeholder special moves already in place. There s still some issues to iron out such as how and when to trigger special moves but I m iterating on these ideas all the time. There are functional multiplayer modes including local and online. There will be a large roster of playable characters, with concept art showing images of a moustachioed luchador and a Southern redneck massive stereotypes, in other words. It sounds pretty fun in a Mario Tennis sort of way, and it obviously a massive departure from Facepunch nudey survival sim, though perhaps not quite so huge a departure from the extremely silly Garry Mod. If you wondering, a joking commenter under the reveal post, whether, Garry Mod and Riftlight have now been cancelled, here Garry Newman reply and sorry Thanks, Eurogamer.",

For instance, I ate a cheese, ham and pickle sandwich for lunch, and can only imagine that my decision has already sent someone into an incandescent fury. Luckily, what I did do was announce a. Facepunch Studios did, and the developer is now faced with a backlash. The reason? Early Access survival is yet finished. Are we crazy? asks Facepunch Garry Newman, who is about to drop some analogies up ins. Are we doing it wrong? Should every person in the company be working on the same thing? Should HBO make TV show at a time? Should Warner Brothers make movie at a time? The point, as you can probably tell, is that work on Riftlight wo affect the development of. In fact, it of a number of being developed by the company. Assuming the full post and got all the information and are still angry they are probably going to be even angrier to find out that we have three other prototypes being worked on by Facepunch staff. Our strategy at the moment is to hire talented people to make the they want to, Newman writes. We re not asking you to fund this. We re not starting a kickstarter and begging you for money we re funding it. We are spending money and Garry s Mod make to do this. Arguing that we should be that money back into only those is telling apple they can t spend the money they made from iPhone and Macs to fund the development of the iPad. Keep in mind that we spent money Garry s Mod made to develop and that turned out pretty good, right? Or should Helk and Pat have been working on Garry s Mod all that time? Newman points to the RustUpdates Twitter account as a sign of the work that still being done on the, and states his belief that funding a is different to buying into Early Access. We funded for years before it eventually became what it is. You bought early access to it. When you buy a pizza you aren t funding Dominos, you re just buying a pizza. It s true that the sales of have been insane and we have stepped up development to suit, and I think you only have to compare the experimental version to the live version to see that. Finally, Newman confirms that all the people who work on are still working on not the studio other prototypes.",

        "content": "a bookmark Permanent Link to The problem with survival Have you ever seen Survivorman? It s a documentary series about a guy called Les Stroud who spends a week in the world s most inhospitable places deserts, rainforests, tundras and survives with only the clothes on his back. Fakers Bear Grylls have doctors on hand, camera crews, and cosy hotels to return to after filming, but Stroud does it all for real and films everything himself. It s good TV, and I promise that after you watch the first episode you ll be hooked. Anyway, what Survivorman shows us is that nature is terrifying, and doesn t care whether you live or die. These great, lonely expanses, whether it s the dense jungles of the Amazon or the icy plains of Alaska, are cruel, merciless places. Stroud is a seasoned survival expert, and even he struggles to find food or keep warm sometimes. Imagine if you were out there. You wouldn t last a day. So why do survival always have enemies in them? Zombies, cannibals, wild animals it s completely unnecessary. Nature has already done the hard work and designed the most formidable, intimidating, ruthless villain imaginable itself. Survival sim developers seem to think they need to include some kind of threat to keep players interested, but that isn t the case. Being stranded in the middle of nowhere with no food, no fire, and night closing in is scarier than any monster. A survival doesn t need conflict. There are other ways to keep a engaged. There could be exploration elements discovering abandoned camps or ruined buildings, and using them as makeshift shelters. There might be stories to discover, or clues to escaping the wilderness an old map left behind by a hiker with a route scribbled on it. Or imagine finding something Christopher McCandless bus, and reading his diary by a flickering campfire. But for this hypothetical to work, a lot of love would have to be put into the atmosphere and design of the world. You d need realistic weather and lighting, and stunning natural beauty. That s another thing I love about Survivorman Stroud is always in awe of the majesty of his surroundings, but respectful, and occasionally fearful, of them. With a large, diverse, and beautiful environment to explore I d love somewhere a rainy forest in the Pacific Northwest I d the just to wander the landscape and see what I could find before nightfall. But let s say you re an indie developer making your dream realistic survival, but the guy holding the cheque that ll decide whether the project lives or dies insists on some kind of danger. Well, in that case, you do it subtle. You make animal attacks rare, but possible. As you walk through the forest at night, you might hear a growl, or something stalking you. But it s unlikely it ll ever show itself until that, unexpected time when it does, and you have to run for your life. That would be infinitely more compelling than a million shambling zombies. survival that almost gets it right is Miasmata. I love the realistic character movement, cartography system, and being able to forage for plants to craft medicines. But then that stupid monster turns up and I lose all interest. The Forest recently a hidden mode type veganmode on the main menu, but it s clear the was designed with the cannibal natives in mind, and it feels a bit empty and aimless without them. No developer I know of has been brave enough to design a survival without any threat. Who ll be the first?",

So every time you to change something you have to chase around finding how these five different systems that it does need work, then you change it and it breaks different systems that you thought had nothing to do with it. With so much of the needing to be changed, Facepunch decided to just start over again. The version will simplify and speed development, and bring to the interface, crafting and visual fidelity, all while maintaining or even improving performance.

I asked the Garry Mod and creator to show us his computer setup and he told me, flat out, that he does use a standard PC. Then I asked him to send pictures of the setup and he included male genitalia on of his monitors. Dude is messing with me. But when you Garry Newman, looking in on the ridiculousness of the industry, you can do that. You can see the notion that a developer should have some PC with a giant case and laugh. You can get an email from someone about showing off your rig and decide to have a little bit of fun. And his rationale for his working setup is fascinating. What in your PC? My work PC is a Mac Pro running Windows. with of cache of ECC flash storage Dual AMD FirePro GPUs with of VRAM each What the most interesting part of your setup? Probably the fact that it a Mac Pro. It looks a bin. What on your desk? Mac Pro, Apple Displays connected via thunderbolt, a phone that I never use and a printer. Do you have a PC? No I do have a. The Mac is probably more powerful and sexy looking than any PC I could build. I never had any problems with performance. PC manufacturers have kind of got it wrong for years when designing PCs. I do want a computer that looks a motorbike, I not years old. I want a PC that does look out of place in my living room. I do want to have to lock it away in its own room. At time I did build a smaller PC with a smaller case, but it was always a struggle to fit everything in, and even then everything was quite loud. Even though I use a Mac I do use OSX. This kind of makes me a sinner in both camps. PC users hate it because I using a Mac even though it just a PC and Mac users hate it because I using Windows. Blur to obscure giant penis. At home I have an iMac with Windows installed. OSX has a tool built in to let you easily install Windows. It not running emulated, it creates a partition and you boot into it. I have wire coming from my computer, and that plugged in the wall to power it. The only disadvantages to using a Mac are the price and the fact that you ca upgrade them except for memory. To me this is a big deal because I rich as fuck so I more likely to just buy the latest model instead of trying to get extra in by upgrading the graphics card. My days of taking my PC to bits to make it faster are over. In the same way that I do take my TV or fridge to bits and change components. This stuff does interest me. I just want to use it. What are you playing right now? Banished. What your favorite and why? Ever? My favourite ever is probably Black and White. I do know exactly why but it a that I return to and through at least once a year. Newman sent a picture of his desk for inclusion",

Well that is obviously because the model system is a huge car crash. All the clothes are included as part of the model. I tackled that this week. The model is now just animation data and we can drop models onto it. This means that in the future if we want to add a set of clothes for the the artist just needs to model it. They don t need to recompile the whole. This is a huge deal to us because we want to explore customizing the s look a lot in the future. We want improvised clothing. We want blood decals. This makes that feasible. Animation animation is something that I think we can all agree needs a bit of love. So we ve switched over to Mechanim.

This means we don t have to animate things the turning to face something, or looking up and down. We can do it in code which makes it look a lot smoother.

It s a pretty simple system in theory. You divide the world up into a grid, then the only gets information about stuff in the cell he s in and the surrounding cells. But there s a lot of moving parts. You need to account for objects moving from cell to another, you need to tell players in the cell it left that it s now gone, and players in the cell it entered that it now exists, and what if a is subscribed to both cells? You need to account for players moving between cells, you need to send players entering a cell the contents of that cell, you need to tell them to delete the contents of cells they re leaving.

We re pleased with it. a the video It s very early days in this development but it s at a place where I think we re ready to share it with you. It isn t finished, there s a lot we want to explore. This doesn t rule out specifically made maps, but I think there s a lot more value for money in this method, where the server owner will generate a map from a seed so every server you on could potentially have a completely different map.

Network Recode We use uLink in our current implementation of. We have been mostly happy with it. We had issues when we first launched with DDOS attacks. Servers could be taken down easily with just a few packets. When we mentioned it on this site we were surprised by how reactive the uLink guys were. A few DDOS exploits were fixed, and more were discovered and fixed. Eventually everything was fixed, we all agreed that their support was top notch and we were very happy. Then a couple of weeks later the CEO emailed me asking to help correct some mistaken information. He mentioned that they were changing their EULA so that if we made another post about bugs that hadn t been fixed they d revoke our license. From our point of view the only reason these exploits were eventually fixed was because we made that post. We could have easily posted a ticket and waited over months with no resolution again but in the meantime could. Then a few weeks later we got another email asking us if we d to buy a yearly support license. It cost times more than our existing yearly license or we could buy a yearly full source license, for times our existing license fee. I asked what we were paying our existing license fee for. We don t want to pay them for access to their source code so we can fix it for them. But on balance even though it did feel a bit of a we decided that we d made enough money from so far that we could justify the support license, especially with how much their engineers helped us over the holidays. At this point we got distracted with a bunch of other issues then of their engineers made it clear that they ve been told not to help us with any of our issues until we have a support agreement, because they have to prioritize on tasks that are economically sensible. So we decided to write our own networking library. Don t get me wrong, the decision wasn t totally based on pettiness and spite. We have a few technical reasons to do this. To do what we want to do we need more control. Don t worry, this isn t something we decided yesterday. We decided it a long time ago. And the good news is that the implementation is pretty much finished and ready to be tested. I don t announcing intentions, I announcing results We re obviously not going to inflict this change on everyone without testing it properly, so some time in the next couple of weeks we ll have an experimental build up on for people to help test it so we can iterate and evolve. Oh and because we re awesome this implementation lets the server and client in build. So you can make listen servers, and single versions. We re not totally sure whether that s something we re going to make available straight away but it not having to a server every time you change code sure makes development a billion times faster. Other Stuff Here s what the artists have been up to. Dan made some barrels! made a hammer Gooseman made a bear And a Deer When is the next? So what s likely to happen is this. Some time in the next weeks a branch will appear on. The community will be split in. and old.

Honestly right now, the less people playing it the better. But Humble changed our mind. of all sales to charity. So we decided it wouldn t hurt. More Item Editor I want to explain more about the Item Editor. I want to make it clear why we re bothering, and why it s awesome. So let me walk you through how the a Fire item works. If you click the link above you will see a number of modules. For any item these modules can be turned on and off. World Model controls what the item looks when you drop it into the world right click drop. This could be a different model to what it normally looks. It could be a sack for example. Container means that this item can contain other items. You can specify what type of items, and whether these items are accessible in the inventory, world model and deployed. Crafting lets you define blueprints to make this item. Deployable means this item can be placed in the world when selected in the belt bar. The oven lets you specify the temperature this item and its contents reaches when switched on. And then we have events these events all add context options to the fireplace. So when you right click in the inventory or use in the world, you are presented with these options. These events have conditions. So for example the Ignite option won t show if the fire is already on, or if the fire doesn t contain fuel. So here s how that looks in when you use the item. So the fire works. What about cooking stuff? Well, that s generic too. a a look at this page. As you can probably see this event gets run when the temperature is between and. When the cooked var reaches the action gets run. Which is to swap the current item with a cooked version. This is nice and generic, nice and open. We can easily add an event to cooked so that if t s cooked for another seconds, it becomes burnt. Then if it s cooked for another seconds it becomes charcoal. This exact same logic can be applied to a furnace object, or a freezer without any extra coding. So what about fuel? You need to put wood in the fire, right? Well technically not any more. We can add the a module to anything and it instantly becomes a fuel source for an oven. Other Stuff So that s been keeping us busy. Dan has finished the a Trap model, and Alex has animated it. Alex and have started a a more customizable model. is a off work on the rocks. Andre has been a the possibility of dumping viewmodels and using the s model instead. Time Scale We made a bold decision this week, which will mean that the next will either come a lot faster than we re expecting, or a lot slower. We re hoping it s a lot faster, and I hope I have more to share about that next week once we ve walked the path a while. Sorry again for this huge void. Please understand that when we we didn t expect anyone to buy it, so we thought we had lots of time to slowly remove shitty placeholder code and replace it with super awesome future proof code. We expected to slowly build up a following while we were developing. We need to make drastic to the codebase to be able to continue. Reposted from a",

The Item System The old item system was a bit of a mess. So it was. We now load items via JSON. Which is generated by the item editor website. You can add modules to an item in the editor website to add functionality. There were a few features on our wishlist for the item system. Items need to all have size and weight. We need to make items be able to other items inside them. We think this will open a world of emergent gameplay if we can pull it off right. For example, you could possibly put some poison inside some. You could put a key in an apple and feed it to a pig. There s a lot of options here. We re hoping that by being able to add universal components to items this, we ll be able to make the system more open ended. An example of this is the throwable component. The axe, the flare and the pickaxe should all be throwable right? Deployables A deployable is something in your inventory that you place in the world. The deployables system is being too. This isn t such a big deal, because it kind of works exactly the same. But unlike the old system, the system keeps hold of the item. This means that it s feasible to be able to pick deployed items back up. Internally this makes the code cleaner and more generic because we can use exactly the same inventory code to browse the contents of an item in the inventory when it s deployed in the world. Weapons and Tools The weapons system is being too. We ve only just started this so I don t know of any obvious improvements. of our dreams is to make reloading more involved with modern weapons. We don t want you to just press reload and it somehow, in the background, takes your clip out and fills it up with bullets from your inventory, then puts it back in. We want you to into combat situations will your clips loaded. I am probably alone here but I want you to sit in your home, manually dragging bullets into clips. Then when you re in a situation, you ll hold down reload and choose which clip you want to swap to. This way, when we introduce different types of ammunition tracer etc, you ll be able to put them in your clips in a specific order. I m sure a lot of people don t see that as a good idea, but I see it as a good way to nerf modern weapons in a common sense way. Building System We re going to change the building system a lot in this pass.

This code is tied very harshly into our old GUI system, NGUI. Which in the next is completely replaced by our system of choice, DFGUI. Which will probably be replaced again by Unity s GUI system when we eventually move to Unity in a few months which is why this inventory code is very much UI agnostic. I know what you re thinking.

The very instant I popped into the world I heard a voice behind me, yelling. Who are you! It was more of a statement of rage than a question. Shocked, I turned and saw him.

Here a tip do run around at night with a lit torch or you get shot. I know this because I once ran around at night with a lit torch and got shot. That why, more recently, when I was alone and lost in the middle of the night, I only lit my torch for a second to take a quick look. Here another tip do light your torch even for a second to take look around or you get shot. I did. For a second. And I got shot. In the crafting survival, I recently become stuck in a comfy rut. I made some friends and together we created a safe valley neighborhood there seemed no real reason to stray from. With plenty of resources to gather and trade and a network of helpful neighbors, I was finding this notoriously violent and unpredictable a bit, well, humdrum. Eventually, I became curious about what else the world of had to offer. What lay outside my peaceful valley? What was down the road? What was over those hills? And what was over whatever was over those hills?, I just accidentally got lost day and had no choice but to step out of my comfort zone and start exploring. So, there I was, completely lost, at night. I lit my torch to get a look around just for a second and someone immediately opened fire from close by. Bleeding, I ran away and someone chased me, continuing to fire. I was about to run out of blood, and perhaps he was about to run out of bullets, because we both stopped at about the same time. I crouched, bandaging myself, trying to hide in the grass. I could hear his footsteps circling nearby. I started eating all my food, just so if he killed me there would be much to loot. Yes, while crouched bleeding in the bushes, I ate five cooked breasts simply out of spite. Finally, in stable condition again, I took off running. He either lost interest or lost sight of me, and I did hear him again. Huh. Now I the weirdo creeping around people houses in the middle of the night. As I ran through the night, buildings loomed at me from the darkness. Some small and simple, some grand and complex. As soon as passed from view another would appear, the creations of dozens of players I never even seen in all my hours spent on the server. Most of the homes were dark and silent. Very occasionally, I would overhear a snippet of conversation as or more players worked through the night on some crafting project, locked safely in their communal home. Sometimes, while pausing outside a building with windows, a pink face would silently peep down at me through the gloom, then retreat from view. It always darkest before the dawn. Except in, where it darkest all damn night. I reached the ocean at dawn, and yet another large building overlooking it. Who was building all of these structures? How did they find the time? This server had been wiped clean and reset less than a week ago and despite spending some eighteen hours playing I barely managed to prop up my ugly, hovel and help my friends with a couple small side projects. Some of these buildings I was seeing were preposterously huge and intricate. Many were incomplete, and nearly all seemed completely unattended. That house has more stories than Isaac Asimov. AM I RITE I continued on as the sun came up. I ran through the day, passing dozens of shelters, shacks, homes, strongholds, and forts. I kept running as the sun began to down, and ran through the night again. Soon I began to see fewer buildings, and eventually, none at all. When the sun rose again, I could see evidence of another in any direction. I saw no more wild animals, no more irradiated beasts, no more logpiles to chop or even boulders to mine. Just hills, dirt, and trees. I was in the wastelands. Leave only footprints, take only pictures. Because there simply nothing else TO take. For full days and nights I sprinted. I sprinted until my hand began to cramp from holding down the keys. There was so much nothing, acres of nothing. Miles of it. night I built a tiny dwelling and a campfire on the tallest hill I could find, just so there would be something to look at. In the middle of nowhere, I a little somewhere. I spent the night cooking in my shack and crafting whatever I could just to give myself something to do. The next morning I started sprinting again. more full days and nights I ran, and still, nothing. No people, no buildings, no animals, and except for trees no resources. It impressive how massive the world of is, and it bizarre how empty that world can be, especially when it feels so crowded in other spots. For days, the only proof I was alone on the server was the steady scroll of inane blather and accusations of hacking in the chat window. Eventually, I found the other edge of the island and tried to psych myself up for a long, run back to civilization. Before I left, I decided to see what happens when you step into the ocean in. Spoiler alert you die instantly. While I was a little disappointed I wanted to make it all the way back home again on foot I was relieved because I was damn sick of running my way through all of nothingness. I respawned at my sleeping bag in my house. And there I was instantly confused. When I spawn in my house, I usually find myself staring at of my four walls. Instead, I was staring at the rocks and trees of my home valley. Why had I spawned outside? My house has become a hole. A moment later I realized I had spawned inside. It was just that my walls were gone. As was my ceiling. And door. And my stairs. Oh, and all of the stuff I spent long hours collecting and crafting. Someone had blown my house apart and taken everything in it. I been raided! Damn! I ran off to find adventure and excitement and it had happened to my house while I was away! I ran over to my neighbor massive home, to see if he seen anything. His house was missing some doors and walls, too. I ran to all of my friends homes, and they were all blasted open, empty, silent. The whole neighborhood had been sacked. I spotted someone coming toward me across the valley and I ran to meet him. Hey, do you know what happened? I asked. He shot me dead instantly. I respawned in what was left of my house. What happened was, the stranger said in text chat, I killed you. Twice more that day I was shot and killed in the fields I used to feel safe in. The valley was no longer full of friendly people I knew, it was full of violent people I did. My workbench and forge had survived the raid, so I spent the next day and night scurrying around the valley, collecting all the resources I could. I crafted a gun, some ammo, and some walls. The only thing I did have enough metal for was a door, so I huddled in my house until morning, guarding my meager stash. While other players freely about Mass Effect, I spent the evening pointing my loaded pistol at the open doorway of what used to be my home. They talking about the indoctrination theory. That not going to help me stay awake all night. I eventually got my hovel rebuilt, at least the ground floor, though who knows how long it will last. As for my group of friends, I have ever seen them again, not on that server. There are structures being built in the valley all the time, but I shot dead whenever I near them. I no longer a part of this neighborhood. It under management.",

        "content": "a bookmark Permanent Link to diary, part It s hard to kill a naked jumping man This is part of a diary from noted naked man Christopher Livingston part here, and come back next Wednesday for part three of his adventures. It the dead of night and I in my cabin, which, at the moment, is essentially just a box. But I have plans for expansion. Big plans! adding a second box. Next to the main box. So it be boxes. Anyway, I crafting with the spoils of my daytime scavenging and hunting. I got ore simmering in the furnace, food cooking in the campfire, and I banging together some building materials at my workbench. That when I hear footsteps outside. They approach slowly, crunching through the grass, until they right outside my cabin wall. Then they stop. Then nothing. Having a house in the Early Access crafting survival comes with a few benefits. Drop a sleeping bag, and now you have a place to respawn. Build a workbench and a forge, and now you have a place to craft. Build a storage box, and now you have a place to your materials. There a downside, however. Once you got a home, you got neighbors. And neighbors love to drop by. A sleeping bag, a roaring fire oh, and some creep outside peekin in. Take this current visitor, who has walked up to my cabin and is apparently standing just outside. I hold my breath, straining to listen. I nervous. I mean, I know my door ca be opened by anyone but me, and my tiny cabin is almost certainly too small for someone to bother wasting explosives trying to get in. But still there someone some other human person standing right outside my walls in the middle of the night. I extinguish my forge and campfire, plunging my cabin into darkness. I hold my breath. There some shuffling outside. I can barely see a human figure crouching in the moonlight. He peering through the narrow gaps in my walls. He a virtual foot away from me and we staring at each other through a crack in the wall. It unsettling. I fire a shotgun blast at the wall, knowing I ca hurt him from in here, but mostly to let him know I actually do have a gun and I not AFK. He crouches there a moment longer, then I hear him walk away. The next night, again, I hear footsteps approach. This time, they stop right outside my door. Hello, says a hollow, monotone voice. Hello. I friendly. You can open your door. Somehow I not convinced. He circles my house a couple times, reassuring me in his odd, flat voice that it OK to let him in. I sit inside, eyes wide, until the footsteps recede. Compared to the people in, bears are nothing to worry about. The next day I build another room onto my house, and put in some exposed stairs leading to what I plan to be the second floor. Around dawn, I have another visitor. I douse my flames and listen while the footsteps from the grass outside to the boulder next to my house. Then there a clunk as he jumps onto my roof. Whoever he is, he walking around directly above me. Anybody home? a voice asks, knowing full well that somebody is home. Anybody? If nobody home, then I just tear down these stairs. There a splintering noise as he starts smashing my staircase. I have no idea if he can actually ruin my stairs or not, but I prefer he did. I outside. What going on? I ask him. He walks off my roof and lands in the grass. He wearing only pants, and holding a rock. Come here, and I show you. I walk over, because in general I choose to be trusting. I am extremely stupid. He immediately begins trying to smash me with his rock. I pull out my pipe shotgun and fire. Naturally, I miss. The only thing worse than a guy who might have a shotgun is a guy who definitely has a rock. We have a merry little chase. Him, trying to bash me with a rock while hopping around a kangaroo, me backpedaling, firing wildly, missing, and trying to reload my boomstick. Finally, I make a buttonhook around my house, slither up the boulder, and slide down the other side to the grass. He follows but makes the mistake of leaping off the boulder. He lands with a crunch and drops to the ground, where his prone body appears to suddenly be sleeping. I assume he dead, but just to be safe I shoot him at point blank range. His body vanishes in a spray of blood and is replaced by a backpack. He carrying nothing but starter gear torches and bandages. And his rock. The dude from Part? He still looking out for me. With a big gun. So, it seems I been welcomed to the neighborhood,! It not all bad though. The kind benefactor from my first diary entry lives a short distance away, and drops by every so often to see how I doing, to give me the local news, and to brutally kill any interlopers he spots. When I tell him about the guy who tried bashing my head in, and how long it took me to kill him, he says, Yeah, when someone comes at you with a rock that it hard to kill a naked jumping man. Meanwhile, this ninja brandishing an axe? He was super nice. I starting to be recognized in the valley. Not all strangers slink around my house in the middle of the night many come over and introduce themselves. My friend has friends, soon I learn their names and get comfortable having them around. We share resources if someone has a project going. We swap news, stories, and advice. If someone accidentally gets shot which happens, apologies are made. If someone accidentally gets shot and killed which happens, gear is politely returned. It feels a little neighborhood. A weird, violent little neighborhood filled with irradiated bears and men. Now the sight of naked men running toward me is a happy. It means I home. Speaking of the neighborhood, it sprouted some buildings. The next time I log in, someone has built a wide three story building with barred windows and a series of ramps leading up side of it. I impressed it taken me days to build a tiny, and someone arrived and threw this together alone in a few hours. However, as you can sort of see in the screenshot, our neighbor left out an important detail ceiling section. Word around the valley is, as soon as he logged off, everyone in our climbed the side of his house, jumped through the roof, and looted his storage crates. I have a look inside myself the place has been entirely cleaned out. He has been back. I guess it pays to get friendly with the locals before building a condo on their block. Walls are important. Doors are important. Ceilings?. Speaking of friendly locals, it now been days since I had anyone creep around or try to kill me, which makes me think that perhaps I leading a life. I got my cozy corner of the server, and it great, but maybe it time I left it for a bit, to get a true taste of the outside world. Maybe it time I went walkabout! I should point out, I do make this decision. It sort of made for me. After a day of hunting, I run back to the cliff where my house is located, but when I get there my house is missing. It because I run to the wrong cliff. I run to another distant cliff, but it the wrong as well. things occur to me I completely and utterly lost, and the sun has gone down. How hard could it be to find my way home? Alone? In the dark? Oh god no. You know how Bilbo Baggins went There and Back Again? Next week, I try to do the same.",

The will include big updates to Unity s audio and lighting tools and engine support, according to Unity Technologies. Unity will be available for starting today, and is accompanied by a trailer featuring lots of flashy light rendering and a distortion soundtrack. Every time we ship a version of Unity, we re looking to empower developers with technology that more powerful and easier to apply than ever before, David Helgason, CEO of Unity Technologies, wrote in a press release. With the huge additions of shading, lighting workflows, a platform, and a method for user acquisition, we re improving Unity dramatically from both a creative and business perspective. Unity has partnered with Mozilla to bring the engine to WebGL, meaning that Unity could run inside Firefox without any additional. Mozilla has written up a full post about the collaboration here, and the Unity booth will be showing off this ability with builds of Dead Trigger. Users who will get access to the current build of Unity and all planned updates. Unity launched years ago, and has provided the base for, Kerbal Space Program, Gone Home, and Surgeon Simulator.

        "content": "a bookmark Permanent Link to diary, part Frosh Man has a gun! This is part of a diary from noted naked man Christopher Livingston come back next Wednesday for part of his adventures. By now, we completely familiar with the basics of crafting. You hit a tree until it becomes tree parts, then use the tree parts to build wooden things. You smash a rock until it becomes ore, then smelt the ore to build metal things. You meet a guy named Batman, and he follows you around for ten minutes eerily moaning, Take me to your house. Show me your house. Show me your houuuuuse. Actually, that last part might not be common to crafting. But Batman weirdness is not that unusual in, the crafting survival from Facepunch Studios. My first day in was not particularly unusual. I found some trees and hit them. I saw some rocks and smashed them. I encountered some animals and killed them, and encountered some monsters and ran away. I saw the creations of others and became determined to create things of my own. Standard stuff. Use this thing to smash those things, right? Pff. Who needs a tutorial? Then I built a campfire and tried to cook the animal meat I harvested, but not understanding how to properly use the campfire, I accidentally ate all of the meat raw, and then began vomiting onto my campfire. Then I died. That part was quite so standard. Campfires give you comfort, a place to cook, and a spot to die barfing. My first night in, I ran around with a lit torch, looking for somewhere safe to spend the night, finding only darkened cabins with locked doors. Some wolves attacked me, bit me, and chased me. I found an empty shelter, a simple wooden room with no door, and hid inside. I was hurt from wolf bites, I was trapped by the wolves themselves, I was hungry but had no food, I was cold but had no fire, and I was taking radiation damage from something nearby. Eventually my torch ran out and I died in that little hut, in complete darkness. Where the wolf button? The next day, I decided that if I was going to die alone in pain and misery, it should at least be in my own doorless hut. So, I crafted a stone axe and ran around I whacking trees all day. I met some of the locals. Another ran up behind me and screamed,, into the mic, then ran away laughing. I met Batman, as described above, and tried to ignore his soft, hollow moans. Someone else passed by and, when I said hello, said something so profane in response that I not sure it can be reproduced in writing without adding a few letters to my keyboard. Do give me those doe eyes. Though if you do, I probably wind up eating them. Another man approached. Frosh Man, he said. Do you have a bandage? I said my name was Frohman, and that I did have a bandage not realizing that spawns actually have by default and he started walking away. A moment later a gunshot rang out nearby and the man started screaming. Frosh Man has a gun! Frosh Man tried to shoot me! Oh my God. Oh my God. Frosh Man tried to shoot me! It was me, I told him. I do have a gun. Oh my God, he repeated, running around the map. Everybody, stay away from Frosh Man. He has a gun. He tried to shoot me. Stay away from Frosh Man! Oh my God! He continued loudly accusing me of violence until he disappeared over a hill and his voice faded. Eventually, I collected enough wood, then built my shelter just as night fell. In the corner, I placed my campfire, and carefully carefully inserted some raw breasts I gotten from a deer I killed yes, dead deer give you breasts at the moment. I cooked them and ate them, and I suddenly felt better about everything. I had a whacking tool and a shelter and warmth and enough food, and thus had cleared the first hurdles in every survival. Maybe everything would be okay. Then, another man, this pointing a shotgun at my face, suddenly slipped into my shelter. Maybe everything would not be okay after all. I pretty sure I know how this particular campfire story goes. Hey, he said. Is this your first time playing? You should have a campfire going in the middle of the night, everyone can see it. I pretty to this, I admitted. I just needed to cook some food before I starved to death. I waited for a blast of gunfire, or failing that, a blast of profane derision. Here, he said. Take this stuff. From his bare torso, bags began to fly, by, until they littered the ground in front of me. He gave me wood planks. He gave me ore. He gave me walls, pillars, a roof and a doorway. He gave me storage boxes and a smelting forge and a sleeping bag. He gave me a shotgun, and tons of ammo. As we ran together through the night he answered my crafting questions Can you build a compass? and questions Is there an map? and my personal questions Am I naked?. The answers no, no, yes. He gave me some pants. When another tried to kill me with an arrow, my guide fired his shotgun and chased the attacked away. As dawn came, he showed me a good spot to build my house, in a place called Resource Valley. Campfire, forge, sleeping bag, crates, and protector. Cozy as can be. It was amazing. By showing my complete ignorance to a stranger in this crafting, I had somehow crafted the perfect item a guardian angel, a tour guide, a mentor. A friend! Within the hour, I had a real house built, with walls and a roof and a door that only I could open. I had crates full of loot and a gun full of ammo, all due to the generosity of my tutor. Thanks to him, I had a home. A house just is a home without a welcome mat. Of course, once you have a home in, you have something else as well neighbors. But we get to that particular peril of homeownership next time.",

The arid multiplayer survival sim drops players into the middle of its world mostly naked and armed only with a rock.

We rounded up a few of the best videos so far, featuring a determined and reporter, sky wolves, a house beneath the sea and more.

Slipping into the role of intrepid investigative journalist, he scours brown wastelands for incidents, and finds himself saying things there is a mutant wolf trying to attack a man and another man is helping him with a rock a bear has joined the chase! And watch Argyle interview players in this video. Naked Conga You take many risks when you enter the world of. There the risk of starving, or being eaten by a wolf.

        "content": "a bookmark Permanent Link to guide Surviving your first day Written by Andy Chalk Welcome to a day in! Life is hard in the multiplayer survival our alpha review to find out why it worth playing, but with the right knowledge, you can at least make it through a day. Which brings us to our first tip Check the time. If sundown is approaching, consider quitting for minutes and coming back at dawn. It cheesy, but spending a night in the open without food or shelter puts you at a real disadvantage. Your first steps The rock Your best friend in the early going. Once you ready to begin, equip the rock in your inventory, then find a pile of logs and hit it to harvest wood. Trees will do as well, but they provide far less wood for the same amount of work. Keep your eyes open for boulders and do the same to them to gather stones, metal ore, and sulfur Work quickly, and when you have ten wood and five stones, press Tab to enter the inventory, pull down the crafting menu and make a stone hatchet. Bye bye, rock! Log piles are far better sources of wood than trees. While you continue collecting wood and stones with the hatchet, keep your eyes open for animals. There are you can kill at this stage boars, which you can outrun, or wolves, which you wo have to. Wolves will mess you up badly, but you can usually take down without dying by walking backwards and hitting it with the hatchet while it attacks even so, do yourself a favor and try to find a boar. Be careful while you stalking your prey, because unlike the real world, the animals in get along fabulously and where there boars and deer, wolves and bears often are very far away. If you do get at least five cloth from your first kill, find another animal and do it again. Killing pigs with a rock is the worst thing you do in. It probably best to avoid other people during this delicate time. Some of your fellow players may be very helpful but there are a lot of griefers out there too, and while it easy enough to get away from a guy with a rock, dodging a spray of bullets is another matter entirely. Pay attention to the conversation to get a feel for how things are going if you see a lot of players complaining about being killed and they will most definitely complain you should probably keep a low profile. You can simplify your life by turning off the grass with the console command false, entered without quotes. The denuded landscape is as pretty, but it a lot easier to see things on the ground. On the next page, craft shelter, armor, and weapons Let crafting! It may not look much, but it get you on your feet. Collect as many resources as possible until hunger or darkness sets in, then craft a wooden shelter and place it in an corner by putting it in a slot and then selecting it. Craft and attach a door the same way, then inside, lock up, and make a campfire. Place and start it, then press and hold the Interact key and click Open when the menu pops up. Put the raw meat you collected from your kills it will all be breasts, by the way into the Cook square and give it a few minutes to roast up into a tasty meal. Meat wo bad, so cook as much as you can. Your hovel holds all the necessities fireplace, furnace, workbench, and sleeping bag. With the food on the grill, back into the crafting menu and whip up a bow and a bunch of arrows or at least. You need wood and five cloth to make the bow, which is why you may need to kill multiple animals with your hatchet. The bow is terribly accurate but it hits hard and makes hunting a relative breeze, and at this stage that what you need. A simple bow eliminates most animal dangers but watch out for bears. If you have sufficient cloth remaining, make armor if not, whip up what you can, then eat up at least some of the should be cooked by now and hunting. Depending on how much was left over after building the bow you going to need to pieces of cloth to make the next big jump in progress, so do be shy about killing everything you see. Once you have enough, get back home and craft whatever armor remains unmade plus a sleeping bag. Place the sleeping bag on the floor of your cabin to create a respawn point, then build a wooden storage box, place it and put excess food, wood, stones, and whatever else you can spare inside. Having a respawn point makes bouncing back from death a lot easier assuming nobody comes along and blows it up. Gearing up and getting serious By now you should have a good supply of basic crafting materials, so at this point the becomes less about staying alive and more about transitioning from prey to predator. Use animal fat and excess cloth to make fuel, then use that and some rocks to make a furnace. Wood, metal, and sulfur ore goes into the furnace charcoal, sulfur, and metal fragments come out. Use wood and stones to make a workbench it be crowded in your little hut but everything will fit as long as you not too sloppy with the layout and with all the necessary furnishings in place you can craft a proper firearm, plus gunpowder and ammunition. Stay away from places this until you packing heat. It a lot to do in a single day but with a good jump on the morning and a little bit of luck, it wo be much trouble at all. And now, properly armed and armored, you ready to out into the world. But keep the bow bullets are scarce. Good luck!",

Just a week before it came out, Facepunch of Garry Mod fame and fortune, a DayZish focusing on crafting yourself up from a sort of spawnee to a hermit. And just a few days before that, Days To Die landed, bringing with it all the technical panache of an animated gif of a. I spent lots of time scrounging for survival in all three, but are any worth supporting on Early Access? The nature of these means there a lot that can wrong. At least Bohemia was clear about what they, with this warning displayed prominently on the section usually reserved for info fluff WARNING THIS IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF FUNCTIONING. It not as typographically terrifying as they made out. I lost a few characters at least have vanished in the dark hours when I was playing the, died after a small fall from a short ladder, and I had to leave to starve to death in a sort of limbo when I fell through a floor and could get out. There are other issues zombies will pursue you through walls, fences, and doors, which wrecks an otherwise carefully cultured sense of immersion. But thanks to the, I was prepared for this. Overly prepared, actually those were just moments in almost hours of zombie dodging. It has crashed at all, it mostly runs smoothly on an,, RAM system, and my latest character has been alive for over a week. The internet is rife with tales the dirty sandbox, though my own tales are of a man watching the horror from behind a bush and backing away. It capable of remarkable things, and in this stage I already had more than worth of fun from it. I can similarly recommend. was a for me until I tried it on a whim, I spend my evenings yomping across Chernarus Plus. Now I flow between the. It a surprising survival from the Garry Mod developer, set in a world where you start off with a rock, a torch, and a medkit. Through endeavour murder, you gain better tech. It thematically similar to a multiplayer sandbox where you up against people and the environment zombies, radiation, animals, falling down a ladder, but the details matter here. You can make a proper impact in world through the crafting system, which allows you to build tools, clothes and, most importantly, buildings. Your first night will be spent scavenging the land, hitting trees with a rock to carve out wood, and hitting stones to grab the makings of a hatchet. With that, you have the ability to gather things more speedily, which should allow you to build a shelter and a door. The world is strewn with little huts, built to house spawns spat into the cruel world. With a hatchet to hand, and a generous pile of crafting recipes, it possible to have a little hut all of your own in a short span of time. They dotted about the land, monuments to the people that came before, often abandoned. I wandered the strange map it huge, but only has road, climbed a mountain range, strolled across lonely plains, and everywhere I has at least abandoned shack clinging to a rock face a lost goat. They the of the there are mazes, towers, even entire villages to discover, outposts of the people who. is a bit more cartoony than, but the players are no less barbarous. It is a survival after all, which means you could to the trouble of gathering the material to craft a bow and its arrows and hunt the wildlife for meat and cloth, or you could just find someone who done it and beat them to death. I been killed on sight many times, and I have stories of people luring friends into buildings and locking them in, tossing scraps of food in and taunting them. It might be awful, but it allows for people to be creatively vile. It remarkably well put together for a supposedly early, though it suffers from the attention of hackers. In fact, that the biggest technical trouble it currently faces, with able to wander into your locked buildings and loot your wooden palace. It does feel an early access, with obvious placeholders, missing text, and moments of immersive fumbling breasts being looted from dead pigs and bears, for example. Still, I find it hard to be angry when the sunsets are so lovely, and the dead of night comes alive with torchlit human endeavour. That more than I can say for Days To Die. It way more expensive than both and, and though it open world zombie survival sim, it just not very impressive. If the idea of Early Access is to show off something that people might want to be part of and support, it just made me want to flee. It an ugly, and not in the artistic way the apocalypse can be. It has bad textures stretched over bustable world blocks a la Minecraft, terrible animation, and incredibly awkward action that feels it running twice as fast as it needs to. But I think the sound is the most part of the experience a soundtrack that attempts to evoke the dread of being surrounded by the undead, but with all the restraint of a hungry zombie. Everything makes a weary zombie sound, and it can feel things are near you even if you alone. Worse still are the reactions from a zombie when you assault them punch elicits a groan further strikes and it takes many to put down will create the effect of hitting the button on a soundboard over and over, piling zombie squelches up. It has almost no immersion or sense of dread, and the world is full of oddly placed objects to loot. Why am I looting birds nest and air conditioning units? If there thing it has going for it, it that it leans heavily on crafting. The loot is everywhere, and your inventory enables you to combine objects to craft helpful items. It mostly makes sense, so if you place a pile of sticks in a line they become a club, or a fill out the sleeping bag template with cloth gives you something to place as a spawn point. In addition, every building can be barricaded by breaking down internal walls and filling doors and windows with those blocks. A multiplayer I played at least had a little bit of to it as we tried to survive a zombie assaults by plugging the windows with broken down bits of the house. But after the tedious, flappy fighting against the witless AI, all I wanted to do was wall myself in. So out of three are bad, and in fact both show a huge amount of promise. It impressive that and are capable of offering different things within the same space is more of a survivalist, whereas messy timeline invokes. is about the fall of civilisation, if it has a goal other than to survive, is about the creation of. Both are foundations for the developers to build on, and both are good right now. That more than can be said for our third contender. of its infected antagonists, Days To Die shambles, groaning, at the back of the pack. Is it worth playing right now? Yes Yes, check out our alpha review for more. Days to Die Nope, not yet. Have you played this week alphas? What do you think? Are there any alphas you Craig to try out? Let us know in the comments!",

We have been knocked on our arses by sales. Our plan was to release the alpha on to in a way and slowly build up until the was in a decent state. But our counts have exploded our wildest dreams. So we ve obviously felt a bit by the popularity explosion we ve seen and it s scrambled our plans a bit. We ve had to work with GSP s to bring more servers online and make them more manageable via RCON and stuff. This is something we didn t think we d have to do for a while because we thought we d only need about servers. Then we had the DDOS issues which has taken a week or to get past we re still seeing residual attacks on individual but for the most part they seem to have subsided. So thanks to everyone that has joined us on our journey so far. We re going to be working hard to help you justify spending that on our early alpha and hope you enjoy the progress we make over the coming year. Cheating Well over people have been VAC banned from for cheating. We have done a lot of work on both the client and server to make some cheats impossible. That s not to say that cheating is eradicated. That ll never happen. Even if we somehow manage to totally stop software based cheats people will still be wrapping dental floss around their monitor to form a crude crosshair. But it should now be pretty clear and obvious to people that VAC is active and if you cheat you stand a good chance of being banned. So don t. We have been looking at other cheat solutions. Things Punkbuster don t appeal to us. We don t the idea of forcing you guys install a cheat client on your PC to. Especially since VAC is already installed and works just as well. There are serverside solutions Fairfight which do appeal but we re not so sure of their effectiveness or accuracy. The last thing we want to do is ban legitimate hard working players. It s an area we will continue to test and review. Client Performance It pains us to see people posting videos and screenshots of with the grass turned off. They are obviously doing this for performance reasons and if it gained us extra we d turn it off too. Performance is something we re keeping a close eye on and looking for opportunities to improve FPS at every turn. Server Performance It s not something that most of you have probably noticed or even care about. servers run kind of great. servers are pushing it. servers are non existent I don t think technically even supports them. Server performance is something we hope to work on and improve. The problems probably aren t apparent when you join a freshly made server but once the server has about structures it will start to get laggy and we ll start to see periods of unresponsiveness. We re going to have to put some tools together to catch and log these hitches and hopefully get them fixed. Linux Mac Getting Linux and Mac working just as well as their PC versions is another of our top priorities. It s important to realize that because we re using Unity our hands are tied in a lot of ways here. If something runs great on Windows, but runs crap on Linux our options are pretty limited because all the workings are on Unity s side of the engine. In fact most of the time our best and only option is to turn that feature off on that platform. This isn t a great solution because you don t want to a with crippled graphics. Mac users account for around of our purchases and of our online players. To us that means that of those players either can t start the or aren t enjoying the performance of it. We re aware that some mac users can t the and this is of our top priorities. Linux users account for of our sales and of our online players. Similarly to Mac, we re losing half the users somewhere we have work to do here. Defending Yourself Defense is something we talk about a lot internally. We have a lot of offense weapons, grenades, explosives. The only defense we have right now are doors and spikey fence. It s obvious that there s a gap here that needs filling. Especially when defending unoccupied homes. When developing this gap we need to keep in mind that people are crafty and will find a way to work around it. They ll build stairs over a fence. They ll put a sleeping bag outside the base so when they die they can respawn there, pick up their weapons and carry on. We want to avoid adding systems to dissuade these types of behavior. If anything they should be rewarded because they re finding their own solutions to problems. We want to find solutions that allow the defending players to find innovative solutions to attacks. Ideally solutions that don t involve putting a million doors in your house, or building a maze around it. Playing with Friends of the most requested features, with votes on trello is shared door access. This is a no brainer for us and reveals that people want to with their friends. They want their friends to share their house. They want to work with their friends to defend their house. Helping people to find, recognize and work with their friends is something we try to weigh into every decision we make. For example if you and a friend are building a house together who controls the house? Should just the builder of a wall be able to rip it down easily or all of his friends too? If we help people cooperate better maybe there will be less murders. Removing Zombies Helk was meant to remove Zombies before we on. That never happened. The sooner we remove them the less people will miss them. We don t know whether we re actually going to have to replace them further down the line. It s not something we want to rush into. Reskinning them so they re mutants instead of zombies goes against the whole point of removing them in the first place which is we re not a clone anymore. Console Release A console release isn t out of the question. But it s not something we re going to be dedicating lots of time to right now. Customization We skipped this completely on the first run at the model because we just wanted something that worked. Customizable faces, beards, hair is something we re in early talks about. It s not as huge priority as other stuff on this list but it s something we re basing decisions on.",

        "content": "a bookmark Permanent Link to alpha review Written by Andy Chalk My first day on the island did not well. Waking after some calamity, it was only a few minutes before I stumbled upon a structure and encountered its owner, working diligently to expand and improve his home. He was somewhat less pleased to see me, however, than I was to meet him. Leave or I kill, he said, four short words I failed to take sufficiently seriously, and a few seconds later he hit me in the face with a hatchet, and then again, and I was dead. That s life and death in, an survival that falls somewhere between and Minecraft and has a way of bringing out both the best and the worst in its players. A babe in the woods only goal is to survive, and it s always challenging. You begin with nothing but a rock, a torch, and a couple of bandages, and if you try to spend more than nights out in the open in that condition, you will die. It an intimidating, introduction to the, but is a forgiving experience. Most of the world will do its best to kill you and while epic multiplayer battles are rare, ambush murders are not. Nor are you particularly durable, unlike conventional videogame characters, and if somebody puts a few bullets in you, you will die. Yet that fragility, coupled with the freedom offered by an, arena, is exactly what makes it work. forth and do whatever the hell you want is exhilarating. The of Corrugated Metal There a primal thrill to running through the jungle some Tarzan, but if you serious about staying alive then sooner or later you want to build some form of shelter. Construction options are quite limited so you wo be erecting any great architectural masterpieces, but having a relatively safe place to crash and your stuff can extend your lifespan dramatically. Crafting is an even more important component of the and while it likewise neither particularly interesting nor flexible at this early stage of development, better equipment is the key to survival. The transition from prey to predator can be tedious, but once you packing heat and pants, the real fun begins. The conventional fauna is bad enough, but there are deadly zombies and radioactive hotspots that give the a faint whiff of. Worst of all are your fellow players, who ensure that no matter how powerful you are, you never entirely free of danger. At point, and equipped after several hours, I was hunting zombies near some radioactive fuel tanks. Quick from my dispatched them and I was starting to feel a real badass, which is probably why I was paying as much attention to my surroundings as I should have been while my attention was occupied by the inventory of my latest undead victim, a pair of bandits snuck up from behind and creamed me with a shotgun. I come a long way from swinging a rock. That not to say that everyone you meet is a paranoid, social Darwinist, and in fact there a considerable degree of cooperation to be found in some locales. But it comes cautiously, while vicious, violent death lurks everywhere. There are servers for those who prefer less capriciously lethal entertainment, but while that cuts down on griefers, it does away with of the most undeniably exciting parts of the Random encounters with other human beings in which anything can happen. As frustrating as it is to be blown away without warning, that pervasive uncertainty is a central part of the survival experience, and is vastly diminished without it. It not too soon The alpha test is available via Early Access, and as you expect it very much a work in progress. The graphics are no great shakes and you can expect wonky shadows, occasional clipping errors, and other glitches, and the sound effects do even pretend to venture beyond minimal. Lag is sometimes a challenge, especially when you find yourself caught up in a spot of unpleasantness with your fellow island inhabitants, and simply finding someplace to can be a hassle Official servers tend to be crowded, while unofficial ones can be unreliable. Server wipes happen with major updates, so it best not to get too attached to your stuff, and there are plenty of gameplay oddities for instance, every animal you kill, from boars to bears, provides breasts for food. I have found any chickens in the. Mmm,. s alpha is rough, but it surprisingly playable. The underlying systems are essentially complete and functional or at least appear to be, from an perspective and recent updates have dramatically improved the performance of the server browser. has a ton of potential, and it an intense and impressive experience even now. Price Release date Out now via Early Access Developer Facepunch Studios Multiplayer Server dependent, typically Link it on CPU, RAM, DirectX video card Alternatively Verdict Fun to now An intense, survival, is a great use of Early Access.

        "content": "a bookmark Permanent Link to Garry Newman interview on and freedom we give them the tools, they make the world has been causing a bit of a stir on Early Access this week. The open world, survival is made by Facepunch Studios, which includes the designer behind Garry mod, Garry Newman. Players are free to hunt, gather and craft their own structures, choosing their own alliances and enemies in a bleak post apocalyptic environment. How is everyone getting along? What are the best builds Facepunch have seen so far? We asked Garry, and you find his answers below. PC Gamer What the grand concept behind? Why did you want to make it? Garry We love and we wanted to make a it. So we did. We quickly realized that we could create an explorable world as well done as so we came up with the idea of having the create the world. This was the seed that spawned. We loved the idea of players starting with nothing, and having no goals but to exist in the world. Every decision we make is pushing emergent gameplay. So the players themselves decide how the are made. We give them the tools, they make the world. For example a problem we had was that users wanted to be able to open each others doors. The solution suggested was to have a list of users that you can add to a door to let your friends use them. That great but it does happen in real life. It too secure. It not exploitable. So what if the door has a combination that you share with friends. Or a key, that you make copies of and give to friends. This solves the problem but it leaves a lot of room for emergent gameplay. You could build a house and hide the key somewhere in the world for another at a later time. You could be forced to hand over your key at gunpoint, and be locked out of your own house etc. PC Gamer It an incredibly ruthless, and players often kill on sight. Do you have any plans to this, or do you see it as part of the experience? Garry So thing that was suggested was making. Making people turn evil, get a negative score if they attack other players. We hate that. People should be nice to each other because they get a nice feeling from being nice. There should be a system hanging around forcing people to be good. It removes a lot of gameplay fun. of the things we did that made a huge difference here unexpectedly was add voice chat. A lot of the time players attack each other out of fear. They do want to be the person to die. Being able to talk to the other guy and feel them out that way makes a huge difference. There a lot of this we can do, kind of social engineering to make people more comfortable with each other. PC Gamer There are a lot of around at the moment. What do you think sets apart from the competition? Garry To be totally honest we have played any of the others. With we making the we want to. We being ruthless with the development, being careful to test each theory instead of just dismissing it as a bad idea. We handling the building, cooking, crafting stuff pretty well I think. To the point where I think it convinced some of the bigger boys to add it to their too. The fact that we can influence those that inspired us is proof enough that we doing something right. PC Gamer Have players done anything in the that has impressed you? Garry Hah every time another comes up to me in and does bash me to death with a rock I impressed. There a lot of building that impressed us. There a lot of rival gangs stuff that actually causes a lot of problems for us, because they get too powerful and consume all the resources on the map. We need to look at ways to balancing that. PC Gamer There lots of stories of players imprisoning other players and having fun with them. Garry During early development we accidentally left a small white static cube out miles away from anywhere. There was a French server we joined and they built a huge shrine around it in a big circle, a crop circle. Helk tells a story about time he was talking to a bunch of players and showing them the ropes, said good luck then he went to bed, expecting them to die within the next minutes and then hate the and never come back. When he went on next they played through the entire night, had got all sorts of weapons and built a huge. PC Gamer What kind of behaviour have you noticed emerging? Any kinds of styles that have surprised you? Garry It a weird thing. When any can kill you easily and they do, it the biggest compliment ever. They become good friends. You to bed, and lie there and think to yourself that was a nice guy, I hope I run into him again. It a very weird feeling to be having in a. I mean, people help each other out in all the time. A medic tops you up, but you do feel a closeness to them. I guess it because the world is so harsh you kind of feel closer to people that are kind. It must be an reaction or something. PC Gamer How much impact does the community have on the ongoing development of the? Garry It has a huge impact. It a double edged sword. Some people get a lot of stuff wrong, in their suggestions and ideas and they get angry at us for doing things differently. They say we going to ruin the and stuff. Which I do know Do they think they know what we doing? Why would we want to make our worse? They do understand what the is about and do trust us to take it in the right direction. But then there a huge group that instantly get what we trying to do. They get that we want to do things different. They understand why the has to be harsh, why we ca add reputation points. And they make awesome suggestions that we never even thought of. Sometimes we have a problem and we have solutions, but we know in our guts that none of them are perfect, they compromise what we doing and they going to cause more and more comprises down the line. Then we the forums and someone will have posted something that is just so perfect. We love that. Having half a million brains looking at a problem can usually produce the perfect solution.
