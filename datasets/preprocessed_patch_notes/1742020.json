They include the following Quick A online option that allows players to swiftly join an matchmade lobby. Players can now utilize the training mode while awaiting a match. Extras Shop and Achievements A shop has been to the main menu. cosplays, music, stickers, online lobby titles and more have been made accessible for purchase using Nenecoin an currency that can be earned by playing the in a variety of ways.

Cosplays Per Idol and Default Palette Adjustments Stickers Several stickers have been for use in online lobbies. They can be purchased through the newly shop. Various Performance Updates And Improvements Tutorials We have updated the tutorials to reflect the altered gameplay mechanics discussed below. We recommend that both and returning players visit to see what has changed. Universal Gameplay Thank you for continuing to support Idol Showdown. We have been working hard on delivering a Idol Showdown experience based on feedback. This is a major revision to almost all aspects of the. Our goals with this include Encouraging more interactive through Providing more defensive options. Reducing the number of checkmate situations. Creating a less volatile and more stable. Improving balance between characters. Improving balance within a character s kit by nerfing dominant and oppressive tools while buffing underutilized options. Lots of have been made within Idol Showdown Next Fes too many to easily fit into notes. Much of the frame data within the has changed, so we d to ask our players to explore themselves to find out exactly what is different. Throughout these notes we will highlight the biggest within the Next Fes. Mechanic Super Chat Reversal While blocking, if you hold forward and press M and H at the same time, you can do an invincible attack that does no damage but pushes the opponent back. This costs superchat bars. This gives an additional option to get out of an opponent s pressure. Mechanic Jab chains You can chain light attacks into themselves even on whiff. Certain characters will have different limits on how many times they can chain jab into itself. Mechanic Invulnerable Backdashes Backdashes now have full invulnerability on startup up to a certain point. This can help escape some oppressive situations. Mechanic Additional Simple inputs You can now perform different strength variants of special moves by pressing the special button in addition to the strength of the special move you desire. For example, if you are playing Korone and hold back and press special and heavy at the same time, you will get EX chainsaw. Various other universal General Balance You are no longer able to combo off of meter frame invincible moves. You can not superchat cancel or call a collab during a frame invincible or armored move. Moves with frame armor now lose their grab protection on wakeup. Generally, EX moves that provide frame advantage have had their advantage dramatically reduced. OTG moves now have an IPS limit of. After a move hits OTG, the opponent will be sent instantly into the IPS state. Moves with disjointed hitboxes have been given proper hurtboxes with a few exceptions. There are no longer any frame head invul moves. The fastest head invul moves in the now come out on frame. Now, when performing an instant block, the rewarded superchat will vary depending on the damage of the move blocked. Burst has a slower startup but a slightly bigger hitbox. Grabs have a shorter range. Grab tech has a longer time before both players can act again, increased pushback, and increased superchat gain. Frame data of all universal overheads has been standardized. When moves are blocked in the corner, they now have more pushback. Other You can no longer steal the corner by jumping into the corner. There is now a buffer for being able to perform dashes. This should help with micro dashes in certain combo routes, notably Ollie s. An additional visual effect has been a lightning effect to signify moves with unusually long hitstun. Character Ninomae Ina nis Witty Artistic Ina is a midrange charge character who controls space with her tentacle attacks. She unleashes latent power from the Ancient Ones when the opportunity arises, leaving her opponents without an inkling as to what hit them. Something unique to Ina is that she has visual indicators for when she has charged her charge attacks. If you have down charge, the halo will glow. If you have back charge, the book will glow. Existing Character Fubuki We wanted Fubuki to be a versatile character with a particular strength in patient, reactive. While Korone was shaped to be more, we wanted to emphasize Fubuki s power in neutral. In addition, several were made to help Fubuki make better use of her Idol Skill. These help Fubuki feel more distinct as a character and help compensate for some tools Fubuki lost due to universal system. Highlights Mechanic When performing a special move using simple inputs, the move will never be an SSR. This allows players to hold onto stocked Burger Fox or Pity SSRs while still having access to Fubuki s specials. Fubuki s Burger will now grant guaranteed SSR charges instead of. However, Fubuki is now capped to holding only guaranteed SSR charges at once. SSR QCB The SSR variants of the move will now cause a wallsplat instead of wallbounce when performed near the corner, and no longer cause a midscreen. This will prevent the juggled opponent from being put into impossible positions when the SSR occurs at specific parts of the screen. SSR DD Frame full invulnerability. Changed to reflect DD head invulnerability frames. Korone with Korone are focused on making her less powerful and more focused. Korone is currently a character due to her high damage and oppressive pressure. However, Korone has very neutral and defensive options, making her overshadow many other characters. In this, we wanted to provide Korone more of an identity as well as give other characters a chance to shine. We are doing this by accentuating Korone as a powerful pressure character, while nerfing her neutral and defensive. Highlights Super Input Korone can now access her supers separately with QCF S and QCB QCF S performs her super directly without performing the uppercut super on whiff. QCB S triggers the uppercut super which is fast and retains invul frames. Korone s DD S will no longer cost any meter. This gives Korone a very powerful tool in both pressure and in combos. Korone s now has an extended hurtbox and less forward movement, pushback, blockstun, and frame advantage in order to make the move less abusable. Korone s Chainsaw special moves have been significantly reworked and have sprites. The most significant include All chainsaws have increased recovery time Light Chainsaw no longer has any projectile invulnerability Heavy chainsaw has increased startup. They deal more chip damage than before. Suisei We imagine Suisei as a powerful pressure character with an oppressive vortex and among the strongest offense in the. However, as a tradeoff, Suisei intentionally struggles with limited defensive options. We feel Suisei meets her intended playstyle well and wanted to preserve this identity in this. However, we thought that her plan was too dimensional and relied on a few particularly powerful tools. To this end, we made adjustments that buffed and nerfed certain parts of her kit to make her use a wider variety of options in her offense. Highlights In order to preserve her identity as a character with limited defensive tools, Suisei is the only character in the whose backdash does not have any invul frames. As a tradeoff, she retains her backdash speed, which is now by far the fastest backdash in the. Super Input Suisei no longer needs to install her supers. She can now directly into both. The forward super is accessed by QCF S and the anti air super is accessed by QCB However in exchange she lost all invulnerability on them. QCF H has armor on top of it, but the armor does not activate immediately. This is to give it more of a use in neutral as well as add an additional call out option for Suisei. QCF L is now more negative on block. Crouching M s startup has been slowed down and been given a hurtbox during its active frames. In exchange, Standing H now connects from Crouching M even at its furthest ranges. Suisei s DF M slide has increased frame advantage and a longer duration, giving her another option. Suisei is cute in this too. Sora Sora is a hybrid character who retains decent pressure tools. Although Sora is currently a very powerful character, we wanted to preserve Sora s identity, as she is a very unique character Therefore, Sora remains relatively unchanged aside from targeted nerfs to her most oppressive and options. Highlights Forward M s hurtbox has been extended and given a much slower startup. QCF L is now a projectile with a hefty attack level. QCB mines now away when Sora is hit. Ayame Ayame was previously a character that relied heavily on a few powerful tools such as her DD H invincible reversal, which could be combo d out of. Due to universal to invulnerable special attacks, Ayame lost what was previously a core part of her identity. In order to compensate for this change, we decided to buff other parts of her kit to more evenly distribute her power across her kit. Our goal was to make her feel mostly similar, but use a wider portion of her moveset. Highlights Rekka Followups Ayame s Light Rekka Series now has additional followups M is a low. H followup is an overhead. The additional have been from her QCFH rekka series. However, this Rekka now pops up opponents for additional combo opportunities. Jumping Special saw little use. To remedy this, her Jumping Special will now groundbounce when hitting Aerial opponents. In addition we have given it an increased downwards hitbox. Sweep is a move that saw little use. It has been given additional range as well as been made easier to use in combos. Coco Due to universal to OTG, we had to rework some of Coco s combo structure. As a result some of her moves have fairly different combo structure allows Coco to land more fire attacks than before within a single combo Due to this, we have scaling to fire damage when used within a combo. Highlights Sweep now vacuums opponents in, allowing it to be used in combos. QCB M now counts as a projectile, giving it the ability to clash with other projectiles. To replace OTG no longer being able to combo, now applies fire damage. places the opponent slightly closer to you to help keep Coco s pressure going. Aki We felt that Aki didn t have a clear vision and relied too much on gimmicks. In this Aki has been significantly reworked to fit the role of a proper zoner. Her fireballs were tweaked to cover more approach angles as well as do more chip damage against blocking opponents. In exchange for additional zoning options, we have toned down her ability to mix up the opponent. Highlights Specials Aki s projectiles have been reworked. QCF L and M diagonally downwards at slightly different angles. QCF H is a straight multi hit projectile. The QCB series are now projectiles as well, the L and M version serve as her anti air projectiles. QCB H is a delayed multi hit projectile. Muki moves have been moved to the down down inputs. Aki s teleports have a charge motion input down up. In addition they were reworked to move her backwards instead of forwards. EX teleport is now invincible on startup. Aki s normal attacks have increased in attack level, improving her blockstrings. DD S now has a different buff. Instead of making her projectiles home in, it instead adds an additional hit to her projectiles, giving her an edge in projectile wars as well has giving her better frame advantage on both block and hit. is now more plus on hit and less punishable on block. Hitting at the right angle allows for followups. Botan Botan has some awkward parts to her kit, but overall is a solid character. Most of Botan s have been made in order to compensate for Botan s losses due to universal mechanics adjustments. Highlights Super Botan has a super accessed by QCB This move has an invincible startup, followed by a barrage of bullets. As a result of the universal to frame armor moves on wakeup, Botan shopping cart is now weak to meaty grabs and can not be made safe or combo off of using Superchat Cancels. The addition of this move provides Botan with a reversal option as well as an additional option to convert from longer ranged pokes. DD M has received an additional low followup by hitting light. The jump arc of DD M goes further. Crouching M s hitbox has been extended. It has more hurtbox and slightly increased startup to compensate. Grenades now away. Pekora Pekora had some good pressure but suffered from an unbalanced moveset, with certain extremely powerful tools overshadowing other moves. due to universal OTG, she lost some of her power so were made to help keep her OTG useful. These were made to reduce her oppressiveness in both her pressure sequences and her zoning. We targeted the most powerful moves in her kit, while rounding out moves that were previously overshadowed. She is still in both areas, but should be easier to deal with. Highlights QCB L Pekora moves backwards less after launching a rocket. DD H TNT now goes away on hit and has reduced frame advantage. QCB M now puts the opponent into a hard knockdown state when hitting OTG, giving time for a mixup afterwards. QCB H now shoots faster, does more damage, and can now be kicked. The move is air untechable and as a result should be easier to combo off of. DD L Can no longer place another TNT while the previous TNT is being kicked or launched. DD S is now air untechable, making it easier to combo off of. Super is now air untechable, which should resolve issues where opponents could hit Pekora even after she lands her super. Ollie Ollie remains mostly the same, with some targeting her midrange capabilities. We wanted to make sure that Ollie s offense remained powerful, but make it more difficult for her to start it. Universal do a lot to make her less oppressive. We ve done a few things to aid her quality of life. Highlights Increased recovery on and, but both have increased hitstun and blockstun to compensate. now connects to her specials that lead to knockdowns at further ranges. DD S now deals recoverable health damage during the initial laser. The big attack at the end still deals normal damage. QCF L hitting grounded opponents now puts them in an air untechable state. Collabs General Collab The following apply to all gameplay involving collabs You can no longer hit L and H at the same time to perform an you must use the collab button instead. We this macro because we noticed it would often cause players to Light or Heavy moves when attempting to summon their collab. We have moves to some characters which now utilize the QCB S input. As such, are now performed by holding forward and the collab button at the same time. In order to reduce resource competition between and superchat, the will now always have maximum bars of superchat. The cost of an will still vary depending on the collab chosen, and the UI will indicate when they can be summoned. If a is hit within a short window off time after summoning a collab, it will disappear. We ve made this change to attempt to provide increased risk and counterplay to utilizing collabs. Collabs Collab Fauna Off Collab Fauna releases a pulse that pushes the enemy away and turns half the partner damage taken into recoverable health. Call In Fauna summons saplings from the ground that pull the opponent closer upon stepping on them. Collab Subaru Off Collab An idol is on the loose the Oozora Police starts chasing them around, hitting everything in the way. Call In Subaru slams a big sausage onto the ground, hitting everything on the ground. Existing Collab Adjustments While we still want collabs to a large role in gameplay, we noticed consistent issues with them Collabs were being used as general win conditions in a way that we felt often overshadowed the kits of characters. We ve attempted to tune collabs such that they now either serve a consistent small benefit, or provide win conditions that can be accessed more situationally. We identified a few collabs Ame, Miko and Roboco that were being consistently chosen over the others by almost every character, with the remainder either being niche picks for certain characters or outright ignored. In this, we ve attempted to level the power of all collabs. Mio Call in Scaling reduced to. Marine Off collab Now costs superchat bars. Off collab No longer puts the opponent in hitstun. No longer gives the opponent increased chip damage. Now reduces the opponent s movement much more even including certain mobility special moves. Kanata Off Collab now costs superchat bars. Call In Reduced range. Risu Off Collab Now costs superchat bars. Off Collab Greatly increased hitstun and blockstun on nuts. Call In Now has normal scaling. Kiara Off Collab Slightly increased startup time. Call In Opponent falls out of this move less. Call In Spawns closer to the. Amelia Now ground bounces when hitting aerial opponents and puts standing opponents in increased hitstun. Reduced startup. Call In Now has normal scaling. Iroha Off Collab Hitbox extended further down. Moona Call In Now produces a purple flash on the screen when summoned to help with visibility. Call In Now has normal scaling. AZKi Off Collab Now costs superchat bars. Off Collab Has increased range, increased duration, and can debuff opponents on the ground. Call In Now has normal scaling. Kaela Off Collab Now gives attack and defense as well as lasting longer. Off Collab The buffs now last for a longer duration. Roboco Off Collab Interval between missiles is lower now, effectively shortening the duration. Call In Greatly increased startup. Slightly increased hitstun. Miko Off Collab Now has a limited range. Has a longer startup before falling. Call In Increased startup. We wanted to highlight some of the bigger that each character received, but even these only account for a small percentage of how each character has been changed to fit within the system of the. Online Titles, stickers, and banners display within lobbies All Elo reset to Custom border for Elo and above Decreased the time for match timeout, preventing hard freezes when an opponent disconnects Pregame and postgame stickers have been for interaction between matches an Elo penalty when quitting during an online match Optimized the artificial delay during frame drops to more accurately calculate the delay Various fixes to ensure lobby connections work as expected Quickplay option quickplay to automatically match players based on Elo and ranges Includes an indicator when people accept, estimated ping, and search status Option to switch to training mode as well, and start search from training Virtual Frontier General Change Our goal for Virtual Frontier was to make it more resource management focused and provide players with more meaningful decisions to make, as well as provide the information necessary to make those decisions. In addition, we recognize that Virtual Frontier may be played by players of many skill levels and therefore wanted to add a wide variety of difficulty options and modifiers so players of various skill levels can tune the mode to their liking. Content Bosses A Boss character can now be fought at the end of Virtual Frontier run. These bosses offer a unique experience that contrasts with normal fights and can provide a test at the end of every run. Fubuzilla Kurokami Kronii The boss Error Sora will no longer appear at the end of a Virtual Frontier run, but will still appear as the final boss of Arcade Mode. Shops In addition, we have Shops to the virtual frontier. These shops are intended to allow players to have more control over their Virtual Frontier runs. Shion Shop This shop provides several options to transmute their current items into items. Players are limited to actions per visit. Enchant Upgrade an item to another item of a higher rarity, in exchange for a large fee Disenchant Downgrade an item into of a lower rarity, but receive Pekos in return. Mutate Change an item into a random item of the same rarity in exchange for a small fee Rio Shop Rio s shop allows you to items in run and pick them up in a subsequent run. This can be used for highly customized builds or to target difficult achievements. Gameplay Updates We have now stat items that can be received as rewards from fights these provide the with small but consistent upgrades to basic attributes. In the last version of Virtual Fronter, we noticed that it was often possible to snowball very quickly due to how frequently opportunities were given to pick up items. We thought that this was good, but should happen further into runs we hope that stats will accomplish this by diluting the frequency of item pickups. We ve a variety of snacks and accessories to the, and made balance adjustments to items, fights and economy. Finally, we ve several fights, and made difficulty adjustments to ones including tuning the AI to be susceptible to fewer degenerate counterplay strategies.

NOTE updates may have a chance of desyncing old VOD s if character adjustments were made. A warning will be shown when attempting to load an older VOD. Lobby Improvements Since lobbies are our primary online feature. We are adding the following improvements to our lobby system with the Ollie. Reduced the performance impact of multiple spectators on players. Lobby members including host can freely move between and spectator positions if they are empty. Hosts can now set up a rotation where the winner stays and the loser leaves. These features can allow a group of people to all in the same lobby for an extended session and minimize the amount of time needed to leave and create lobbies. The goal is to reduce unnecessary overhead time to allow players to as smoothly as possible. KNOWN ISSUE Spectators can cause synchronization issues, more spectators will increase the chances of it happening. Currently, spectators utilize rollback to spectate, this is a known issue and we are working on a fix for it. Stage In preparation for future stages, the stage select screen has been updated to allow for more than stage options. Adjustments and additions have been made to the following stages Moonlit Gates, Main Stage, and Gang City. Updated AI The AI has been overhauled to provide a more engaging experience for arcade mode and virtual frontier. In general, easier AI difficulties are now easier than they were before. Harder AI difficulties are now harder than they were before. Ollie can now appear as an opponent in Virtual Frontier and Arcade. AIs will now be less likely to block mixup options such as Overheads, Lows, and Grabs if you have not performed them yet in a match and be more likely to block them the more often you use them. In Arcade, when selecting easy, medium, hard, or intense difficulty options, the AI difficulty will now scale as you progress Classic Arcade mode reduced in difficulty. Improved AI performance. Training Mode Additional Updates The Training mode has been further expanded. Frame Data meter has a color Key. Frame Data Meter has been updated to display additional information regarding startup active and recovery frames. option for AI to only block Low, Mid or High attacks. Other When you enter the Infinite Prevention state in midair, a restand state will no longer be forced. Tiger Knee inputs are now supported. and icons over collabs. Loosened the window between when an opponent jumps over you and when you turn to face them. This effectively means players will turn around to face an opponent earlier than they did previously.

        "content": "Overview Thank you for playing Idol Showdown! The on the Beta branch are now being merged onto the standard release branch. The following is the final list. Overview The goal of this is to address the most disruptive character issues and establish system that can even the playing field across characters. This will help us establish a baseline from which we can then build upon in subsequent patches. Due to the nature of this, it will contain primarily nerfs to problematic moves and strategies. Although there are not many direct buffs to weaker characters, the in this are intended to benefit weaker characters. Due to the amount of, we wanted to first evaluate the meta before preemptively changing currently underutilized characters or moves. From that point onwards, we will have a firmer foundation which we can build upon. General Features and Mechanics We discovered that the system mechanics we had were very skewed against certain characters and playstyles, with certain characters receiving more resources to work with then others. As a result many of these are intended to better balance and provide all characters similar opportunities. Although we expect there to still be variation across characters, it should be a lot closer than before. STAR Meter core issue with character balance and gameplay revolved around STAR meter imbalance. There were main issues with STAR meter gain that we are aiming to resolve. In the previous version, we felt that STAR meter gain was overwhelmingly skewed towards the winning, giving the losing very little to with. In addition, STAR meter gain was too imbalanced between characters. Many characters with long combos such as Aki and Botan would gain many times more meter then other characters such as Coco. Since the characters with long combos were some of the strongest characters in the, this change has a slight balancing effect as well. The STAR meter will work as follows. Meter gain will now scale down as the combo goes on. Meter gain will be scaled by per move in a combo, with a minimum meter gain. Meter gain on taking damage and blocking will be significantly higher from before. After performing a STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to for frames After performing a Super STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to for frames After performing a, meter gain will be reduced to for frames After performing a Super chat cancel, meter gain will be reduced to for frames Dashing will no longer gain meter Superchat SC Meter The Superchat meter has a similar issue to STAR meter gain where the amount gained was too imbalanced between characters. In particular, the Motion Input superchat condition needed to be. These are intended to better balance Superchat gain across characters. In addition, we have rebalanced our Superchat conditions and conditions in order to encourage neutral. Finally, we the ability to gain superchats from Burst in order to provide an alternate use for burst and provide opportunities for interesting decisions The Superchat values are as follows Superchats gained from performing Motion Inputs can now vary between Special Moves. Overall, the average amount of SCs gained from motion inputs has been reduced. The average amount gained has been reduced Anti Air SCs increased Hit SCs increased Punish SCs increased Grab Break SCs increased SC condition for a successful Normal Throw landing a Burst on an opponent in neutral will give full bars of SC meter landing a Burst on an opponent who you are comboing will give full bar of SC meter In addition the following were made to the Superchat system. The Superchat banner will now have the money value reflect the actual amount of superchats gained. Idol Skills in general give more superchats than before. Hits, Anti Air and Punish Superchat conditions no longer applies to Projectiles Character HP Values In order to provide our characters a more unique identity, we allowed characters to have different HP values. The Character HP values are as follows Aki Ayame Botan Coco Fubuki Korone Sora Suisei Other Gameplay Instant Block will now reduce blockstun by frames. When performing a Burst in midair, you will be unable to attack or block until you land on the ground.

        "content": "Overview Thank you for playing Idol Showdown! We have received more playtesting this first month than we had ever imagined. However, a result of this playtesting is that we have uncovered several systems issues and unintended character exploits. The goal of this is to address the most disruptive character issues and establish system that can even the playing field across characters. This will help us establish a baseline from which we can then build upon in subsequent patches. Due to the nature of this, it will contain primarily nerfs to problematic moves and strategies. Although there are not many direct buffs to weaker characters, the in this are intended to benefit weaker characters. Due to the amount of, we wanted to first evaluate the meta before preemptively changing currently underutilized characters or moves. From that point onwards, we will have a firmer foundation which we can build upon. General Features and Mechanics We discovered that the system mechanics we had were very skewed against certain characters and playstyles, with certain characters receiving more resources to work with then others. As a result many of these are intended to better balance and provide all characters similar opportunities. Although we expect there to still be variation across characters, it should be a lot closer than before. STAR Meter core issue with character balance and gameplay revolved around STAR meter imbalance. There were main issues with STAR meter gain that we are aiming to resolve. In the previous version, we felt that STAR meter gain was overwhelmingly skewed towards the winning, giving the losing very little to with. In addition, STAR meter gain was too imbalanced between characters. Many characters with long combos such as Aki and Botan would gain many times more meter then other characters such as Coco. Since the characters with long combos were some of the strongest characters in the, this change has a slight balancing effect as well. The STAR meter will work as follows. Meter gain will now scale down as the combo goes on. Meter gain will be scaled by per move in a combo, with a minimum meter gain. Meter gain on taking damage and blocking will be significantly higher from before. After performing a STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to for frames After performing a Super STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to for frames After performing a, meter gain will be reduced to for frames After performing a Super chat cancel, meter gain will be reduced to for frames Dashing will no longer gain meter Superchat SC Meter The Superchat meter has a similar issue to STAR meter gain where the amount gained was too imbalanced between characters. In particular, the Motion Input superchat condition needed to be. These are intended to better balance Superchat gain across characters. In addition, we have rebalanced our Superchat conditions and conditions in order to encourage neutral. Finally, we the ability to gain superchats from Burst in order to provide an alternate use for burst and provide opportunities for interesting decisions The Superchat values are as follows Superchats gained from performing Motion Inputs can now vary between Special Moves. Overall, the average amount of SCs gained from motion inputs has been reduced. The average amount gained has been reduced Anti Air SCs increased Hit SCs increased Punish SCs increased Grab Break SCs increased SC condition for a successful Normal Throw landing a Burst on an opponent in neutral will give full bars of SC meter landing a Burst on an opponent who you are comboing will give full bar of SC meter In addition the following were made to the Superchat system. The Superchat banner will now have the money value reflect the actual amount of superchats gained. Idol Skills in general give more superchats than before. Hits, Anti Air and Punish Superchat conditions no longer applies to Projectiles Character HP Values In order to provide our characters a more unique identity, we allowed characters to have different HP values. The Character HP values are as follows Aki Ayame Botan Coco Fubuki Korone Sora Suisei Other Gameplay Instant Block will now reduce blockstun by frames. When performing a Burst in midair, you will be unable to attack or block until you land on the ground. All bursts now have significantly more recovery to Getting hit during backdash and dash will no longer result in a hit. Reversal Indicator when performing an action on the first possible frame after being knocked down. You can no longer be hit out of a grab tech. As a general change, invincible reversals that can be comboed off of will now have prorated damage. Other Features Adjusted Aki s Voicelines. Adjusted Fubuki s Voicelines. Adjusted Sora s Voicelines. Stage preview videos. A Unlock pop up window will appear upon unlocking Cosplay winning matches with the character in Local VS mode or Online General Gameplay Bugfixes Fixed Issue where performing a move on Reversal will not towards the enemy position. You are now no longer able to summon Collabs during your opponent grab animations. Though you can still summon them during your own grab animations. You are now no longer able to summon Collabs during Superfreeze animations. The Collab will instead come out the moment the superfreeze stops. Fixed issue where characters were slightly above ground on round start. Fixed issue where you could perform air attacks on the ground if the attack was performed very low to the ground. Fixed issue where you could grab break with a negative edge input. Fixed issue where bursting a attack could result in you being stuck in a hitstun state. Anti Air grabs no longer count as strikes for priority. Meaning they no longer have grab invulnerability during active frames. Fixed issue where projectiles would allow you to bypass move cancel priority. Fixed Rollback issue that would occur on KO where the camera would remain zoomed in after a KO. Fixed issue where hits that locked in your position such as Crouching H s could interrupt moves with super armor. Adjusted Down Down Motion Input detection. Other Bug Fixes The Mouse cursor will now disappear after seconds of inactivity. Fixed settings option issue with Audio when clicking out of the window. Fixed issue where credits BGM sometimes wouldn t. Fixed issue with rebinding and controllers where delete binding and other keys would interfere with players binding. Fixed issue with controllers picking up the wrong binding if a controller gets disconnected. Fixed issue with UI sometimes showing improper controller for gamepad. Fixed issue with Loading Videos causing crash issues on certain computers. Fixed training mode reload bug where dummy record could cause to reload in wrong position. Fixed issue where unlocking cosplay through online matches would unlock cosplay for every character instead of just for the played character. Character Bug Fixes and Adjustments Character Aki Aki ended up being much more powerful than intended. Our current direction for her is to focus on her zoning strengths while toning down her other strengths. As such, we nerfed her approach, mixup, and pressure tools, and made her DDS a more cohesive part of her zoning gameplan. We tweaked her other zoning tools to make more interesting zoning than what previously existed. We would to see how well these align with this Aki playstyle, and evaluate her current power level. Crouching M No longer jump cancellable. Crouching Forward M No longer jump cancellable, but is now special cancellable Jumping M Reduced horizontal range. More landing recovery. Jumping Down M Blockstun increased by frames. All QCF Specials Increased recovery from. All QCF Specials Projectiles will now disappear upon contact with the opponent. QCF L Good Boy Adjust angle of projectile to be lower, making it worse at covering aerial approaches. QCF M Bad Boy Adjust angle of projectile to be higher and extended upwards hitbox, making the projectile better at covering aerial approaches. The projectile has been slowed down. All Muki Specials All Muki related moves will now have Muki disappear if Aki is hit. QCB M Muki Pound! Startup increased by frame. Recovery increased by frames, and chip damage reduced. QCB M Muki Pound! Effect, Aki will now knock the opponent towards her. This will mean Aki will sacrifice space upon. This is intended to make Aki need to more carefully consider when to summon Muki. All Teleport Specials Startup increased. Elven Flash all grounded variations Invincibility frames reduced. DD LHold Elven Flash all variations Recovery is now slower then the Tap variant by. All Hold Variants of Teleport All kicks will now have head property. This would result in the kicks whiffing on characters who are performing their Down H attacks. All Hold Variants of Teleport Visual Hitstop increased. Jumping S Going Down Invincibility. Idol Skill Hypnotic Hips Now grants superchats on use. Startup reduced. Idol Skill Hypnotic Hips effect. Instead of granting the homing ability for the next Good Boy projectile, it will now make all projectiles for the next have the homing ability. Ayame Overall, Ayame is playing similarly to how we intended. However, we feel that she has some noticeable quality of life issues. As such, our focus for her is to give her some to reduce the amount of frustration while playing her. Hurtbox Ayame s hurtbox while being juggled will now the same as other characters Crouching H Now Air unblockable and is head invulnerable, meaning it can not be hit by most air attacks. All QCF Specials Will now provide superchats for each motion input of the rekka. The amount given will decrease for each subsequent attack of the rekka. The exact amount given is different depending on the variant used. All QCF Specials BUGFIX resolved issue where you would continue the rekka when attempting to Superchat cancel into a different special move. QCFL Asura s Fury close Hit will move Ayame forwards more, allowing her to more consistently connect the hit after the first hit. The third hit of the rekka will move forwards less. QCFH Rakshasa s Wrath The final hit of the mid ender will now have less recovery. All QCB Specials Oni Flip far Flip arcs have been adjusted. Can now superchat cancel after landing on the ground. QCBL Oni Flip close Will now be more safe on block or depending on spacing. Jumping Special Heavenly Oni Increased Hitstun and increased size of downwards hitbox. DDH Shin Demon Cutter Now applies damage proration on hit. Idol Skill Karma and Shiranui Now generates Superchats on use. Botan Botan is meant to be a high high reward character. In the previous version of the, we felt that Botan had no clear weaknesses. Her reward was high, but her risk was not as high as we intended. As such, we decided to increase the amount of risk on some of her most oppressive options which some other characters had little to no options to deal with. In addition, we decreased the reward on her Idol Skill which is used as her option. Standing M Followup Recovery frames increased. Hitstun and blockstun increased. Hitstun Blockstun Jumping H Increased Landing Recovery Jumping H Properties, will now only be a single hit instead of a multihit. Jumping Down H Lead Increased Landing Recovery, visual hitstop reduced. Universal Overhead adjusted to be on block. from QCFL Poi high Now Limited to L Grenade on screen at a time. QCFM Poi low Now Limited to M Grenade on screen at a time. QCBL Quickscope low Low profile is now consistent with the Roll followup Low sniper low profile begins on frame. Projectile now spawns further forwards. QCBM Quickscope high Will now whiff on crouching players outside of point blank range. Idol Skill Trials Ascending Startup Increased. Now gives Superchats on execution. Idol Skill Trials Ascending The properties of the attack here changed. It will now be a hard knockdown on the final hit. This means you can no longer get a free follow up. However, her Idol Skill is now counted as Special cancel priority. This means you can still spend Superchats to follow up from the attack. Coco We felt that Coco was not performing the way she should in the previous version of the. In this, we gave her some small quality of life updates. While we realize these seem very insignificant, we re working on a Coco rework. This includes a mechanic for her which will be in the next major. Thanks for your patience Tatsunoko. Standing M Will now stand on hit. Increased Hitstun and Blockstun QCFH Essence of Advancing Assault Dragon Drop Superfreeze frames Jumping Special Dragon Can now be canceled starting at frame. Minimum Height. Fubuki Aside from some extremely techniques, we re mostly satisfied with how Fubuki worked in the previous version of the. As such, we re adjusting how her instant overhead works, and tuning some of her other moves to be easier to deal with for other characters. Standing M Increased pushback on block Jumping H Will now have a sourspot with weaker properties to the original hit. The Sourspot has the following properties Reduced Damage, no longer knocks opponents into the ground, no longer ground bounces, smaller hitbox that can not cross up. Sweep Now moves Fubuki forwards slightly SSR QCF Oruyanke Now knocks opponents down instead of launching them up. QCF H Now knocks opponent down on the second hit. All Jumping Special Variations Aerial Decreased size of second hitbox, Reduced pushback on block Jumping Special Aerial Blizzard First hit of non lucky variation hitstun reduced from. Using only the first hit off of instant overhead now leaves Fubuki punishable on hit. Fubuki retains the ability to combo off of the instant overhead off of the lucky verison of this move SSR Jumping Special Aerial Blizzard BUGFIX Resolved issue with blue hitstun causing the opponent to be stuck if the move was interrupted. DDH Shin Yukkuri Flip Now applies damage proration. Idol Skill Burger Fox Now grants Superchats on use. Korone While we feel that Korone is not extremely in the previous version of the, she did have strategies which were impossible to deal with for some characters. In some matchups, Korone could get into range of her standing M and repeatedly use this move with little. We adjusted the properties of standing M to allow for counterplay. To balance out this change, we increased her reward on hit by reducing the scaling on her air chainsaw. We gave the first part of her forward M target combo a lower cancel priority, opening up conversions and combo routes. Standing M Extended Hurtbox stays out for Slightly longer, Increased pushback on block Recovery increased by. Blockstun increased by net advantage change is from before Crouching M Increased range with adjusted animation, increased pushback on block. Sweep Low profile now starts on frame instead of frame Forward M The first hit now has M cancel priority. Jumping Special DOOG from Above Reduced the effects of Damage scaling Jumping Special DOOG from Above Landing Recovery reduced. It is still minus but not as punishable DDH Super Koro Punch Now applies damage proration Idol Skill Doggy Dash Now grants Superchats on use. Sora Sora s are mostly centered around increasing quality of life rather than balance, as we wanted to see how Sora was affected by the to other characters. We however, realized that Sora s Reflector move was unintentionally causing trade situations that nullified the opponent s offense, so we adjusted the move to be more interruptible. Sora received a special move that she can perform in the air to give her more flexibility. Standing H Significantly increased range. Reduced knockback Crouching M Increased horizontal range on both hits Sweep Now combos into Re mine detonation DDM Reflector! will now appear later and away upon Sora being hit Aerial Special Sky Sora will now be able to manually detonate her Mines while in mid air. Attempting to detonate mines in mid air with no mines out will result in a failure animation. Idol Skill Rakka chan Juggle trajectory adjusted for consistency. Recovery reduced to. Range decreased. Initial hitbox Suisei Since Suisei s current position is generally stable, we wanted to see how she was affected by to other characters and systems before making any major adjustments. Jumping Special Stellar Now counts as a head attack and will whiff against attacks. landing lag kyou mo kawaii Collab Risu We feel that Risu was underperforming, so we let her run you over with her truck while you re on the ground. We buffed the consistency of her nuts. Only Crouching H will send the nuts upwards STAR Isekai Truck Will now hit OTG Marine Hugging Now starts from further behind. Kiara Kiara s was meant to be a combo tool, but the untechable time on the juggle was so low that it was hard to use it this way. The attack is now untechable, and has a larger window to follow up with juggles. STAR Will now launch opponents much higher and can no longer be. Kanata STAR Grip superfreeze frames",
