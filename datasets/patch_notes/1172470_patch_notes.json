        "contents": "OVERVIEW There’s no better way to kick off year seven of Apex Legends than upping the heat of battle. Two heavy hitters that have been in the background a bit too long make their way center stage with updates worthy of Apex Predators, and revamped perks raise up the rest of the Assault Class. No weapon is a bad weapon with buffs across the board for every piece that you can get your hands on. This new meta is cooking and it’s safe to say that this anniversary season flips the season of Support to one of aggression. Coupled with some strong updates for Armor and Helmets, greater access to weapons with the new Arsenals, and reduced visual clutter and time-to-kill has never been faster. It’s a whole new Outlands—be ready to fight. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/cdd24f9da37f3e0cf796d219e234c59f2c050d11.png LEGEND BUFFS ASH Ash sees a number of improvements this season to her Arc Snare and Phase Breach to make them more effective and reliable. Her snare change lets her snag targets against the strong edge of the tether more often. Her Ult goes farther, travels faster, and endpoint detection has improved to make the targeting stickier and less prone to accidental bad snapping. The big change for Ash is her new passive: Predator's Pursuit. This grants her an omnidirectional short-range dash—enabling her to close the gap on a tethered target or evade swiftly in a close-quarters skirmish. With these changes, Ash is set to become the Apex Predator she was always meant to be. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/a3167174bef9efe41bae265fd6dbb6a8f5ec0025.png BALLISTIC Ballistic sees some of his favorite upgrades, the extra charge and sling levelling, integrated into his base kit, giving him more utility and versatility in the early game. A new Level 3 upgrade allows him to double his Whistler charges, opening up his utility and crowd control potential immensely. Tempest, his Ult, now also grants a speed bonus—making him a frightening force when he and his team bare down on you. But the big guns? Ballistic's sling can now carry crate weapons, which can spool with infinite ammo when Tempest is active. In Takeover, Ballistic may very well relive his glory days. ASSAULT CLASS PERKS Assault Legends are walking arsenals: forged in combat and always ready for a fight. Their abilities grant them incredible combat utility that helps disrupt enemies, threaten their positions, or give them openings to strike. These Legends are enhanced with perks that let them worry less about their weapon economy, bring more explosive power to the table, and give them the combat edge to capitalize on one of core moments in any combat encounter—the shield break. Combat Reserve Carry extra ammo per ammo stack Have two new grenade-only slots in inventory Retain access to Red Extended Supply Bins Stowed Reload: stowed weapons automatically reload after 2s Battle Surge: breaking an enemy’s shields grants a speed burst, fast reloads, and highlights the target enemy for 4s {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d08f17eb23de56aa607b50c03a0ba7fb2c0514a0.png WEAPON BUFFS, HELMETS AND ARMOR Over the years, Apex has evolved in so many ways to provide players with more agency and deeper options for how to play, survive, and express their skill. Through that evolution, the benchmark damage for our weapons has stayed stable, but has grown stale. We want to make sure the nuanced flow of combat remains tight and weapons are lethal in order to provide exciting gameplay options. Battle Royales are all about strategy and timing. These are the mechanisms to success, but strategy goes right out the window if encounters are taking too long to resolve and you're dealing with your 3rd, 4th, or even 5th party. This latest suite of changes is designed to keep you in the drivers seat by providing the tools to resolve conflicts faster, getting you back to if the 3rd party is coming and not when. In addition to sweeping weapon buffs, we have taken a look at the defensive side of loot in Apex with some hefty streamlining. Low tier Helmets (white, blue, and purple) have been removed, and rare high value Helmets that provide meaningful gameplay perks have been added in their place. As for Armor, you will no longer level into red tier (125 shields) at Level 4 but will instead be capped at Level 3 (100 shields). However, red shields will still be available in the form of the new Mythic Armor Upgrade Helmet. MUZZLE FLASH Visual clutter in gunfights is no joke. In an attempt to combat this, we’ve reduced the effects and particles you see when you fire your weapon. We believe this update balances increased visual clarity while still selling the impact and fantasy of firing our weapons. All 1P weapons muzzle flashes have been updated 95% less visual noise over the line of sight (sparks, smoke, glows etc) Noise/visuals kept below line of sight Reduced size of muzzle flashes Optimized particle count Cleaned noise from shells ejects Cleaned lingering elements (smoke, sparks, etc) Light toned down to avoid flickering on weapons and environment models For remaining patch notes, please check out our blog here: https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/takeover-patch-notes",

        "contents": "NEW UPDATES COMING WITH APEX LEGENDS™: TAKEOVER We live to fight, Legends. This season we’re bringing the community to the forefront of Apex Legends with some of your favorites taking over content and competition. These Creator Commissioners will craft a series of challenges based on their own Apex experiences with a chance to earn cosmetics. Gear up with Arsenals, a new one-stop shop stocked with weapons and ammo to hit the ground running. Purchase a Legend Spotlight Pass to find a potential new main and earn a Legendary skin for both your new Legend and a weapon. Add in Legend updates and bold meta changes, and we’ve got ourselves a party worthy of our sixth anniversary. Speaking of, our Anniversary Event kicks off at season launch with even more community created content and the debut of the Mythic R-301. This Takeover is a party you’re not going to want to miss. CREATOR COMMISSIONERS Creators take the wheel this season. Four different Creator Commissioners will step into the spotlight for two weeks each, bringing challenges to conquer, new and returning fan favorite modes, and fresh rewards. Week one you’ll chase glory together to complete Community challenges and ultimately determine how many Apex Packs† will be up for grabs the following week. Here are your community goals for each first week: Tier 1 completion: 10 total Apex Packs† earnable Tier 2 completion: 15 total Apex Packs† earnable Tier 3 completion: 20 total Apex Packs† earnable In week two, the hunt is on to earn those rewards! Work through five individual challenges to unlock a Creator-selected Legendary weapon skin and the Apex Packs† you chased in the first week. Participating in week one doesn’t automatically earn you rewards, so you’ll want to jump into matches that second week as well. Plus, earn a Banner Frame when you tune in to your faves on Twitch via Twitch Drops and a free Creator-themed tracker set in the Featured store to gift your friends! If you haven’t already, be sure to connect your EA account with your Twitch account in order to receive drops: instructions can be found here. Creator Commissioners and their Legendary choices: February 25-March 10, 2025: Ninjayla Legendary skin: Wingman’s “Death Ray” March 11-24, 2025: Oraxe Legendary skin: Kraber’s “The Pioneer” April 1-14, 2025: Apryze Legendary skin: Mastiff’s “Bone Breaker” April 15-28, 2025: Kaminari Kyupi Legendary skin: Mastiff’s “Tombstick” ARSENALS We’re bringing the arsenal this season with…well, Arsenals. This new addition to Battle Royale provides easy and consistent access to weapons and ammo of your choice. Stations will be located across all POI's on every map and, while their locations are fixed, the ammo type they will provide is random each match. In addition to providing our full armory of weapons, Arsenals will also provide relevant ammo and the ability to enhance weapons. You can enhance one weapon per Arsenal and that weapon must match the Arsenal's ammo type. Doing so will grant an upgraded attachment and provide an optic if the weapon is missing one. When bins reset, so too do Arsenals—giving you the ability to upgrade again with higher potency. The amount of ammo they provide also significantly increases after a reset. Locate Arsenals while you’re in the Dropship to inform your squad’s drop location, or spot them on the map and in-game HUD once your boots are on the ground. Prefer the hunt? Adjust how much info you want in the settings menu. The choice is yours. Pinging to request a weapon, ammo, or attachment will also automatically ping the nearest relevant Arsenal. META CHANGES We’re bringing a little extra heat to battles this season with a couple of meta changes that you’ll want to get your hands on and test yourselves. It’s buffs a plenty with all weapon classes getting adjusted to feel more competitive with Assault Rifles. That’s right, every single weapon is getting an update. The time-to-kill has been decreased not only with these weapon adjustments, but with updates to Armor, Helmets, and headshot multipliers. Legends aren’t missing out either—the Assault class is getting some hot new perks, and both Ash and Ballistic are getting some special attention. We’ve also made some adjustments to regen items to ensure you still have a fighting chance while taking on these lethal changes. Takeover Patch Notes drop on February 10, 2025, with all of the nitty gritty details. LEGEND SPOTLIGHT PASSES In the spirit of the season, why not let a new Legend take over your spotlight this season? Complete challenges with the new Legend Spotlight Pass to increase your proficiency with a potential new main. Progress through twenty levels to earn rewards that you’d normally have to wait for in shop rotations. You’ll also earn two Legendary Packs along the way: one at Level 10 with a weapon skin and one at Level 20 that grants one of ten available Legendary skins for that Legend. One Legend Spotlight pass can be purchased per season, per Legend in the in-game store and it also unlocks the Legend if you haven’t done so already. SEE YOU ON THE DROPSHIP So, are you ready to rise to the community challenge, Legends? There’s something for everyone this season from buffs to perks, rewards to passes, and even more around the corner. Who will you feel out first: a high-precision simulacrum or a formerly distinguished gentleman? Maybe the buffs of weapons or Arsenals calls more to your heart. There’s no wrong answers here—just the heat of battle. Takeover launches February 11, 2025. ",

        "contents": "Last year we made a commitment to you that we were going to continue to grow our communications and give you additional development insight. For our first dev blog of 2025, we’re sharing progress on the last two hot topics we covered: anti-cheat and matchmaking. We touched on both of these in our Dev Update video that launched today, but we wanted to give a written overview as well. You already know that anti-cheat is an ever evolving process, but we wanted to update you with the latest on teaming, botting, and actioning your reports. We chatted about matchmaking just ahead of the holidays, but there’s so much more to catch you up on including new features in the works. Here’s a TLDR of what we’re covering in today’s dev update: Anti-cheat Update Recent efforts against teaming including recent action being taken on ~1,200 accounts across all platforms and the removal of ~17.4 million ranked points An update on our progress against botting including a brand new machine learning model Report Feedback: a new feature that we’re investigating to provide additional insight into the report you sent in-game Brief touch base around a recently resolved incident that saw some high-profile accounts become compromised Matchmaking Update A sneak peek of in-progress features coming in the not so distant future: Unranked Skill Display, seeding skill values, and lessening Ranked resets Looking at some new and upcoming tests: npc “Apex Bots,” preferential matchmaking (solos vs. premades), and queue time adjustments Sharing some ongoing conversations for added transparency: Ranked premade restrictions, Ranked placement matches and skill difference and scoring Catch up before you jump in with our previous matchmaking and anti-cheat blogs, and keep an eye out on our social channels for more continual bite-sized updates such as the Linux blockage results or adjustments to matchmaking. ANTI-CHEAT UPDATE Anti-Cheat and game integrity will always be a top priority for us and the fight continues as we work to put in safeguards and evolve our systems to stop and get ahead of cheaters. This is another topic that we’ll share updates on as often as we can, whether it’s through social updates or blogs. Today we’re sharing some advances we’ve made in combating teaming and botting, and an upcoming feature to better your reporting experience. TEAMING While Apex is a team game at its core, it’s not a team’s team game. If you’ve not encountered this before, teaming is when multiple teams collude during a match for a shared goal. For those that have experienced this in the past, you might’ve noticed a decrease over the last few months. We’ve actively been targeting this negative behaviour in Ranked modes from multiple angles, including rolling out new automated teaming detection algorithms, swifter and more severe punishments, and stripping any ill-gotten ranked points from offenders. These efforts have led to action being taken on ~1,200 accounts across all platforms, including the removal of ~17.4 million ranked points, and we’ve seen a decrease in teaming thanks to this. We’ll continue to counter this exploitative practice and take appropriate action against bad actors. Teaming has no place in Apex. BOTTING There has been a recent increase in bots that’ve been circumventing our existing security measures and we’re actively working on addressing this. We’ve also created a brand new machine learning model that not only detects this new generation of bots, but was also built to be more future-proof to combat future variants and evolutions. At the time of writing this, our early reviews have found this new model to be incredibly accurate with low false negatives and we’re on track to have this in the live game by the time you’re reading this. Encountering bots like these in your play sessions is not only frustrating, but it also muddies the player pool. Often these accounts are being used for various malicious purposes after they’ve been levelled up including cheating and harassment. Our work here is not done, but we expect another decrease in cheaters and an overall improved experience by continuing to reduce these bots. REPORT FEEDBACK Knowing your report against a cheater has been effective has been long requested by our community. We’re still in early stages, but we can share that this is something that we’re investigating. Look for an update with more details about this potential feature in the future. Please continue to send your reports—each one has the potential to make an impact: If you’re unable to report in-game, you can also report players via EA Help For concerns regarding game vulnerabilities or anti-cheat by-passes, report via our CVD program RECENTLY COMPROMISED ACCOUNTS Towards the end of January, a few high profile pro and creator accounts became compromised. While this has since been addressed, we want to share that we discovered and resolved two exploits that contributed to this One exploit targeted a party privacy status that impacted custom matches, and the other capitalized on our server-to-server handshake verifications—both of which we are confident are fixed and secured. We thank those impacted for flagging this and working with us to get this rectified as quickly as possible so that they could get back into the Outlands. MATCHMAKING UPDATE Our last dev blog provided a good baseline which we can use to focus on what’s coming next, things that we want to test, and ongoing conversations. The team has been hard at work to act on what we’ve been hearing from the community of players as well as our own data. COMING SOON Some of what we’re sharing today is still in progress and may change before it goes live, but here’s a sneak peek at some features coming in the not-so-distant future. UNRANKED SKILL DISPLAY Pre-Match Skill Display in Ranked has been an asset and we’ve seen the impact it has had on your matches, strategizing, and potential flagging of issues. Since it’s seen such success in Ranked, we’ll be rolling out a version for Trios BR at the start of the next season. Its purpose is the same as its Ranked variant: to provide context on where your squad’s skill level sits within the rest of the lobby. Unranked Pre-match Skill Display will look a little different as there isn’t a visible skill value for players in pubs. Here’s what you can expect from this feature: How “wide” the skill is for the entire lobby Where the bookends of the lobby skill sit in the overall skill distribution of all players in this match Your squad’s skill in the context of both the lobby and the overall player-base Note: check out the full blog on PlayApex.com for examples taken from internal testing. One thing that isn’t here that is in the Ranked Display is the number of squads throughout the distribution. We had an early version that included this, but it was not easy to read at a glance. We’ll be releasing a more simplified version to start with while we continue to iterate. SEEDING SKILL VALUES How players start with new modes and LTMs has varied in the past, but it’ll soon have a more consistent approach and result: your starting skill value when playing a new mode for the first time will be influenced by your skill value in other modes. Modes that you’ve played before (including returning LTMs) will already have your match history to work with. Your starting skill value will be more elastic than your other skill values, meaning that it can change more quickly and with a larger swing based on your performance. It will stabilize over a number of matches and your matches will get more consistent. TLDR: the launch of a new game mode will be less chaotic in terms of skill mixing. Now all players will have a starting skill value to match from and they should start to be paired with like-skilled players from their very first match. This will be coming to unranked matches first, but will quickly be followed by a solution that allows matchmaking to seed players into their correct Rank Tier based on their performance in other modes. LESSENING RANKED RESETS On the topic of skill mixing, this happens the most at the start of each Ranked season and each split. We’ve also seen a good amount of chatter about the dislike of both seasonal RP and split resets, and this is an active conversation for us. For the near future, we will be tuning the reset values and reset placements to reduce start-of-season skill mixing even more. This should help reduce skill mixing for players that participated in the previous season, but doesn’t prevent new Ranked players from climbing. This is just one step we’re taking to reduce skill mixing and more are on the way. TESTING These next items are either in testing or will be soon and we’ll aim to share some results and decisions for future in-game changes in a future dev blog. Note: the dates of these tests haven’t and won’t be published to avoid outside influence, but we’ll circle back and share after our internal analysis is done. APEX BOTS (NPC) Bot Royale created an approachable way to build your skills and onboard with a squad, but when you’re ready for Unranked pubs you’re thrown into the thick of it. It’s clear that you’re looking for tighter and fairer matches, especially those who are newer and early-tier players. We’ve started testing something that we think will not only help developing players, but also deliver on the lobbies you’ve been looking for. We’ve slowly been introducing a small and deliberate amount of npc bots, “Apex Bots,” into lower-tier public lobbies. These bots only deploy as opponents and will be a full squad; your squad will not be filled. We want players to have fun playing Apex, and we see this as a potential path to deliver more of that, but we didn’t want to just drop them on you. Enemy bots don’t always create the best in-game experience, so it’s worth repeating that this is a test. We’ll be monitoring and measuring for impact in a few areas: decreasing skill width, decreasing overall queue wait times, and whether or not this helps players increase their game sense and combat effectiveness. We hope to have enough data for next steps by mid-season, so that we can report back and share updates and if we can leverage these Apex Bots for increased game health in the future. PREFERENTIAL MM: SOLOS VS PREMADES A desire for premades to play only against premades and solos to only play against solos is something we’ve frequently heard, but a full splitting of the queues isn’t a possibility that we’re going to pursue in the near future. We need to keep premade squads and solo queueing players together to maintain healthy queue populations and ensure that matchmaking quality isn’t compromised. It’s worth calling out that there would be a significant impact to queue times in order for this change to be felt by players and reach the level of desired impact. With that in mind, we’re going to run a lot of testing to understand the impact of adding preferential matchmaking criteria based on premade vs. solo. The goal of this is for the matchmaking system to take into consideration premade vs. solo queuers, and attempt to match them together as much as possible within the acceptable level of impact to queue times and skill width. We’re looking forward to digging into what is possible and feasible with this as it’s one of the most requested matchmaking changes. QUEUE TIME ADJUSTMENTS At the start of From the Rift, we adjusted how much time CWMM takes to expand the search for differently-skilled players in both Unranked and Ranked BR matches. While this increased wait times, it had the desired positive effect of making matches tighter overall, meaning more encounters with like-skilled players. This also led to more damage output and kills per player, and we believe that these combat-focused measurements roughly translate to both “fun” and “fairness” for the majority of players. While this has had some success, we’ll be continuing to experiment and optimize maximum wait times for various skill bands in order to increase match tightness. We’ve not yet found the sweet spot for this—more work needs to be done. ONGOING CONVERSATIONS These next topics we’re going to cover are ones that are hot both internally and externally. We’re just starting to formulate tests to help us validate our ideas on each and we’ll hopefully have more to share once they’re out of the investigating phase. RANKED PREMADE RESTRICTIONS With the Ranked Skill Display showing that yes, sometimes a Silver can be in the same lobby as a Master, it’s less clear that this is partially due to premade squads allowing players within 2 Tiers of each other. A Silver can pair with a Platinum, and they can then get pulled into a Diamond lobby which also allows Masters (including Preds). Too many ranks for one lobby. We could further restrict premades to reduce the width of matches caused by premade squads, but this would limit who could play together in its current form. We’re not a big fan of that route as this is a team game and forming squads with your friends to compete is something we’d like to see more of. This one needs the most cooking time, and we are going to keep talking about other solutions to this specific problem. RETURN OF RANKED PLACEMENT MATCHES We want players having fun as quickly as possible and one aspect of that is playing against players of similar skill. Previously, we had implemented placement matches where players would play 10 matches and then be placed into their starting Division and Tier for that Ranked season. We’re looking to return to a version of this system as it’s both easy to understand, and effective at detecting and properly placing players even before their first official Ranked match. This system will leverage skill seeding to assist in each player’s placement based on past performance in other modes, and will also rely on Ranked Placement Match performance to influence their starting position. SKILL DIFFERENCE AND SCORING This is a fairly new topic of discussion for us and it’s an interesting one: how can we leverage scoring outcomes to make the match more fair when there’s wider skill mixing in a lobby. One broad example would be if the least skilled player in the lobby got killed by the highest skilled player in the lobby, would they lose less RP? And vice versa, would they get a major bonus to RP (or XP if unranked) if the opposite occurred? Scoring and balance is a super delicate topic and requires a lot of work even before being ready for testing. Right now, the feedback we’re hearing is that it is very much not worth the risk of being in matches with higher-skilled players. While we are doing many things to actively reduce skill mixing, there will always need to be some level of mixing and want to explore options to make it more fair. SEE YOU ON THE DROPSHIP We’re committed to continuing the conversation with you, our community, and we’re reiterating that promise now in 2025. Apex Legends should be fun and competitive without any loss to the integrity of the game, and this is just the beginning of how we’ll be focusing on the issues that are impacting your experience in-game. Look forward to more of these updates as we continue to action this commitment while implementing changes, running tests on community requests, and improving on your in-game experience. Cheers for your patience and feedback, and we’ll see you in Takeover. ",

An ability like increased EVO and Ult charge gains makes the biggest impact when acquired early in a match, so we wanted to try and provide that exciting gameplay without the need to hunt for a rare item. Arc Star Players will now be notified with a “STUCK” message when they have been stuck with an Arc Star Dev Note: It can sometimes be difficult to know if you’ve been stuck by an Arc Star in the heat of combat. This messaging should help take the guess work out of making the right play. Hop Ups Added Select Fire Equippable on Prowler PDW and Charge Rifle Adds a togglable automatic firing mode WEAPONS C.A.R. SMG Damage increased to 13 (was 12) Charge Rifle Increased ammo capacity Base Ammo: 6 White Mag:7 Blue Mag: 8 Purple Mag: 9 Increased projectile size at closer ranges Increased projectile speed Improved recoil Maximum damage for range scaling now achieved at 200m (was 300m) Reduced projectile gravity Now takes Select Fire Hop-Up Alternate fire: automatic firing mode Damage reduced by 25% Increased fire rate Recoil improvements when in auto Dev Note: The Charge Rifle is an absolute monsoon of a gun in the right hands, but it can be a bit tricky to get the hang of. We are taking a pass at making the Charge Rifle more approachable by increasing magazine capacity, adjusting recoil, lowering the range to get max damage, and adding the Select Fire Hop-Up into the mix. Mastiff Aim down sights blast pattern tightening reduced Blast Pattern size increased Increased the time before the Mastiff is ready to fire when raising Raise and lower times slightly increased Dev Note: The Mastiff has proven particularly strong this season and its consistency at range is a big part of that. We are smoothing out some timing issues which allowed niche double Mastiff builds to deal higher than average DPS and pulling some power out of its range by widening the blast pattern and ADS tightening. Peacekeeper Choke speed significantly increased Increased projectile speed Dev Note: When it comes to good range shotguns we want the Peacekeeper’s choked shot to be the main talking point so we’re speeding it up and making the projectiles fly faster. This should drastically improve its performance at range, particularly around hitting moving targets. RE-45 Damage increased to 13 (was 12) Dev Note: The RE-45 has taken a backseat since Akimbo took the stage. This damage bump should help it feel a bit more viable within the current meta.

For us, good matchmaking means putting you in a squad with players of a similar skill, in a lobby with squads within your skill range, where everyone has a shot to come out on top. You may win some, you may lose some, but it is a system that should provide a variety of outcomes with each encounter. Matchmaking is also complex and Apex has a lot of variables to account for that going into assessing a player’s skill; we don’t rely on KDR (Kill/Death Ratio) as it doesn’t fully reflect the complexity of what skilled play looks like in a Battle Royale. We know that there’s room to improve on our matchmaking and we’re going to. A primary goal for us moving forward is to grow the conversation with our community on how our system works, why it works the way it does, and what we’re working on to better your experience. When we’re all on the same page about where we are now, we can then move the conversation forward quickly and towards the outcomes we all want—matches that consistently feel both fair and fun. We are committed to focusing on matchmaking every season, continuing the conversation with you in the coming seasons, and promising that this is a priority for Apex. Here’s a TLDR of what we're covering today: Our current tech systems: the big changes since our last update. We’ve introduced Continuous Window Matchmaking: a dynamic system that’s capable of predicting and adapting to the current live population. This has increased our consistency during both natural periods of lower and higher server populations. Bespoke changes to game modes: we made changes to how we approach measuring and using a value for a player’s skill, and each game mode is measured differently. We don’t rely on KDR as that’s not fully reflective of how we measure success and skill in a Battle Royale. Recent improvements: Ranked Pre-match Skill Display. This launched with From the Rift and has become a tangible means for players to understand the range of ranks they’re seeing in the lobby. Some of these are due to pre-made squads, but some screenshots have helped us with investigations and adjustments. Working with your feedback: we share answers to some of the most commented pieces of feedback. OUR CURRENT TECH SYSTEMS There are 2 major changes since our last matchmaking update that we want to share: Introduction of Continuous Window Matchmaking (CWMM) Bespoke changes to game modes, including Ranked As population shrinks, CWMM widens the skill levels that are allowed into a match. It does this predictively based on live populations, striking a balance between queue wait times and lobby skill width. CWMM has limits in how far and quickly it’s allowed to adapt, which are set as a result of continued analysis and assessment. This means that we can effectively cap both the time a player will wait in queue and also how wide the skill can be in any given lobby; these are the ‘rails’ we establish for the system to work within. From metas to playstyles to growing skills, no two seasons are alike for each player. We’re constantly evaluating and adjusting those data ‘rails’ to keep the majority of matchmaking experiences within our desired design goals. All game modes make use of CWMM in order to match players with the closest skill values possible, though how we determine the skill value can be different depending on the mode. BESPOKE MATCHMAKING CHANGES TO GAME MODES As CWMM came online, we also made changes to how we approach measuring and using a value for a player’s skill. This skill measurement is different between game modes, as is how we decide to update the skill value based on a player’s performance. DAMAGE MODEL Measuring damage output is a reliable way to determine skill when it’s done over a number of matches. It’s a very good system for game modes that have a smaller number of teams and players as damage output is more consistent. All players currently start with a matchmaking ‘skill’ value of 0 for their very first match of a mode that uses this model. Then the player plays the match, (hopefully) deals damage, and then their skill value updates once the match is completed. The skill value consists of 2 parts: Average damage done by players historically, which makes up the majority of the overall value Damage from your last match, which makes up a small part of the value With only a small part coming from your most recent match, the overall skill value becomes fairly stable over a number of matches. This allows exceptional matches to change the outcome more significantly, but not to the point of wild swings. The Damage Model skill value is used when matching in Mixtape (each Mixtape mode has an independent skill value) and certain non-BR LTMs. MATCHMAKING RATING (MMR) MODEL Over time, the team determined that the damage model could be improved upon as Battle Royales have more nuance to being ‘skilled’ than pure damage output. A new set of criteria were developed to establish skill values and when players would get updates to their overall skill value. For all BR modes, an update to your MMR is triggered when your squad knocks or kills a player in another squad. Both squads are then flagged for a skill update because the eliminated squad is likely to leave the in-progress match after elimination. We want to make sure that you can jump right back into another game with an updated skill value for your next match. What determines the magnitude of your skill change is your relative placement in a match compared to the teams you had a significant encounter with (knock or kill) and the skill of the other squad. MMR is a value that falls within a fairly granular range. This is also why CWMM works so well: it starts grabbing those with the closest values of skill when trying to fill a lobby. Matches based on skill will result in fairer games when skill values are specific and granular. It’s a simple system that works effectively and captures what we think are the most important measures of skill in BR—fighting, surviving and high placement. This model is used in all BR modes except for Ranked. RP MODEL For Ranked matches, a player’s Ranked Points (RP) value is used for matching players. This was reimplemented in Season 20 as a response to player dissatisfaction of being a high MMR player fighting against other high MMR players (as MM tries to match closest skill value), but in a low rank tier lobby like Bronze. This combo of using MMR for matching while using RP to determine the progression for players broke the existing player expectation that ‘Bronze lobbies should be easy’ and ‘Masters lobbies should be hard.’ In response, we linked RP and skill, and we are now using RP for matchmaking. There is a loose correlation between actual skill (as measured in MMR) and a player’s RP value. This works fine when a player has plateaued in their seasonal Ranked journey (i.e. when their ‘skill value’ has stabilized for the season), but that isn’t always the case. This becomes challenging when a high skill player starts their Ranked journey at an RP of 1, and they’re matching mostly with other players that have a very low RP value. That player will quickly stomp their way to higher ranks and make the experience less enjoyable for those getting stomped. It also gives the perception that matchmaking is totally broken, and lowers those players’ trust in Apex and their desire to keep playing. In the past few seasons, the ‘RP Reset’ has been adjusted in an attempt to keep similarly-skilled players together at the start of the season, reducing skill-mixing. We are also re-evaluating Provisional Matches as a possible solution to initial Division and Tier placement, preventing some of that initial skill mixing while also making it harder for smurf accounts. As you may know, your RP value gets updated when you finish each match. That updated value is what is used for your next match, so keep requeuing and hit your best tier! RECENT IMPROVEMENTS If you haven’t been in a Ranked match yet this season, Pre-Match Skill Display shows a live display of rank tiers for each player will be shown at the bottom of the screen as the lobby fills for each Ranked match. This was introduced not only for added transparency into your upcoming match, but also to build trust around matchmaking and ensure that it’s working as intended. Bonus: it has given you a tangible way to capture and show us anything that is not balanced. Cheers for sending those through! While some of the screenshots have been due to pre-made matchmaking, some haven’t been and that’s led to an array of actions from slight tweaks to going back to the drawing board. We’ve some additional initiatives in the works that tap into that same goal of building trust, especially around consistently fun and fair matchmaking. So heads up: we’re going to be flexing and straining some of the existing systems and how things have historically worked. There may be some bumps in the road as we find the right fit, but we’ll keep you informed and ensure that our changes align with the Apex community. WORKING WITH YOUR FEEDBACK Your feedback is a big part of that process and we often look at ways to act on it. Here’s some comments that we’ve seen the most and some insights on each of them: Unexpected High Skill Players: “there’s X tier in my lobby” Ranked Tiers And Matchmaking: “each Ranked tier should only be matched against itself” Squadmate Matching: “my squadmates are terrible” Premades Vs. Solo Queuing: “I consistently get rolled by premades as a solo queuer” UNEXPECTED HIGH SKILL PLAYERS This is the most common piece of feedback in regards to why matchmaking is perceived as unfair. You’re chilling in Diamond IV with your squad and what looks like a full 3-stack of players with Pred badges and 20-bombs pops up as the Champion squad. What if you’re playing pub matches or Mixtape and see the same thing? You don’t have the context of anyone's rank to help understand how skilled these players really are in comparison to you and everyone else in the lobby. This is further complicated by a decent percentage of our current players having reached Masters at some point in their past (yes, even outside of Season 17), which means they have the badges and stats to prove it. There’s nothing wrong with showing off on your Legend Banner, but that doesn’t always reflect their current seasonal performance. It often takes time for players who have been away for a while for their skills to get back into the groove after jumping in. There are three major reasons that you’re seeing highly decorated and highly skilled players in your lobby: Their current skill rating is close enough to yours for the matchmaker to put you in the same lobby You‘re in a high-skilled lobby in a premade squad with a player/s higher ranked than yourself You’re playing in a low population queue The solution to the first is something that we have been actively tuning and are getting more aggressive with by prioritizing close skill matches over queue time. This season’s changes will create a longer average wait time (compared to last season) in favor of getting the lobby to be of closer skill as well as some harder limits on which ranks can be matched together. We are hoping the trade-off meets with the expectation of our most competitive players and will be worth it. We are constantly monitoring the state of matchmaking, and this will be no exception. We are always ready and willing to make live adjustments if matchmaking times are worse than expected. The problem of premade squads is something that we try to address in Ranked by restricting squads to be within 2 rank tiers of each other, but matching based on the highest RP value in the squad. This is meant to help counter hard-carries and boosting. In Unranked BR matches, we increase the effective skill value of the squad, to slightly counter the inherent bonus we believe premade squads have. We are looking at adjusting these values up even more and measuring the impact for solo queue players. While low populations due to time of day or region is something we cannot directly control, we’re looking at ways to allow more players to play together regardless of time or region, and we should have more to share on that topic in the future. RANKED TIERS AND MATCHMAKING Similar to the last topic, we’ve seen the feedback around limiting matchmaking by ranks or tighter ranges of RP. We touched on this in our continuous matchmaking section as well with “rails.” Our current matchmaking system treats all players at 16k+ RP as Masters tier players. Players at this level and above are minimal, so we have to match them all together and consider them to be at the same skill level for the purposes of matchmaking. We allow for RP to continue to be gained to allow for Masters players to continue to compete for Apex Predator, but it’s important to note that Pred isn’t a ranked tier on its own. It’s a title that we give to the top 750 Masters Ranked players on each platform. That said, we are continuing to balance time to find a match vs. how “wide” the match can be in terms of included Ranks in your lobby. At the time of this blog, the Ranked matchmaking system allows for the following maximum match-ups (using Diamond Divisions as the example): All Divisions of Diamond can match up to Masters (and therefore Preds) Diamond IV can match down to Platinum IV Diamond III can match down to Platinum III Diamond II can match down to Platinum II Diamond I can match down to Platinum I This doesn’t account for premades though. Ranked premade squad members are allowed to be within two tiers of each other, but they’ll get matched based off the highest rank in the squad. This can result in the above restrictions appearing broken as the effective lowest rank that could be matched is now two tiers lower via a premade squad. That said, this is also the maximum that the matchmaker will try to match to. It will always try to match the exact Ranked tier if enough players of that tier are actively queuing in your region and on your platform. To continue with our Diamond example, it currently takes about 6 minutes for matches to expand to the maximum in the current configuration. SQUADMATE MATCHING How squadmates are chosen by the matchmaker was covered in the previous blog, and it hasn’t changed since then. TLDR: your squadmates are chosen based on closest skill value matching. Of course, if the overall skill width in the lobby is very wide then there may be a gap between teammates. When we examine some cases of ‘bad’ matchmaking it becomes clear that a core contributing problem is conflicting motivations and/or playstyles. You may want to push everything, but your squadmate plays more passively. Or you may want to complete sniper challenges, but your squadmate is already sniping and won’t give it up. There are so many individual styles of play and motivations that some level of incompatibility is inevitable. The best thing we can recommend here is to keep communicating, flex when possible, and remember that we’re all just looking for that next W. The non-social part of this gets improved with overall match width tuning. If there are narrower skill gaps for the entire lobby, your squadmates are going to be very very close to your skill level. Then it’ll be up to you to figure out if you all want to play in the same way. PREMADES VS. SOLO QUEUING It was mentioned above, but worth restating: we give premade squads an effective skill value increase for matchmaking, so they match into higher skilled lobbies. This is to compensate for the inherent benefit of being in a lobby with someone that you’ve presumably played with before and likely have some level of communication and coordination with. We have experimented with preferential matchmaking of ‘solos with solos’ and ‘premades with premades,’ but the results weren’t as clear-cut as you might expect. This is something that we’ll be testing again in the future to hopefully better understand the actual impact and reaction from players. CONCLUSION Apex Legends should be fun, but also a competitive and challenging experience. Both consistently winning and consistently losing is bad for long-term player enjoyment, and the goal is always an optimal experience. We want players to be able to hone their skills and come out stronger as a result. In order for that to happen, there needs to be some degree of challenge for players which is partially where matchmaking comes in, but it’s a delicate balance. Apex has some of the most skilled and competitive Battle Royale players out there today. We’re working to build up the trust in our systems and design approach, and you can expect to see a new focus on that goal via matchmaking.

LIFELINE REVIVED {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/2e051f5d2bb8ad10e524f9972fe25fff4de64edd.png The original medic is now a frontline menace! Lifeline dives into action with an aggressive new kit, the ability to teleport D.O.C. to your allies, glide for unmatched mobility, and deploy an indestructible force field that amps up healing efficiency for your squad. She's not just saving lives—she’s fighting her way to the Champions Podium. PASSIVE: COMBAT GLIDE Hold JUMP mid-air to use to D.O.C. to briefly glide. Deploy D.O.C. to revive teammates, leaving Lifeline free to defend. TACTICAL: D.O.C. HEAL DRONE D.O.C. heals nearby allies. D.O.C. can be assigned to follow allies once deployed. ULTIMATE: D.O.C. HALO Throw D.O.C. to activate Halo Shield System. All players inside use Health & Shield consumables faster. UPGRADES From the Rift: Level 2 Battpack +1 Battery per stack. See Battery Count in Death Boxes. Extended Flight Increase time before D.O.C. runs out of fuel by 1.5s.From the Rift: Level 3 Enhanced Radio Increased D.O.C. assignment range by 50%.Tactical Cooldown+ Reduce Tac cooldown by 10s. RIFT RELICS {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/20f5126e88bd48b1978b3c6790d7fddfc4166a2c.jpg Rift Relics come from the unstable Rift in the sky, creating a temporary tear in reality that provides the contestants of the Apex Games with powerful weapons and a new Survival Slot item, Boost Kits, that may just give you a boost that you need. You could say they’re aptly named. Grab the EPG-1 Launcher with splash damage and rocket-jumping capabilities. Unleash exotic Hop-Ups like Lifesteal, healing with every hit and instantly refilling health and armor on headshots. Rift Relics will appear randomly throughout each match, across many rounds. They will be easy for you and your enemies to spot, and they’ll also inform you if an enemy team has gotten there first. Destroy the Rift Relic to receive your reward, but be warned—the Ring messes with their stability. NEW: SUPPORT CLASS PERKS Last season we gave the Recon and Controller classes unique gameplay perks to help define their areas of expertise in the game. This season will be the season of Support! Alongside Lifeline's Revival, the Support Class is getting a specialization of their own through two new perks: Heal Expert and Revive Expert; empowering their reset and recovery role on the team, and continuing our efforts to bring more meaning and identity to the classes in Apex. Support Legends will still maintain access to extended supply bins (blue bins), however, in the spirit of support, banner crafting is no longer an exclusive class perk and instead will be accessible to all Legends. Support Class Perks Heal Expert Support Legends now move at full walk speed while healing Healing amount from small meds is doubled Revive Expert Support Legends now have 25% faster revives (4.5s) and grant health regen to their ally on a successful revive This health regen will restore an ally to full health, but can be canceled by incoming damage Support Legends will also receive this health regen if revived Additionally, Banner Crafting and Ally Death Boxes now spawn a Mobile Respawn Beacon Support Legends can see Mobile Respawn Beacons inside Death Boxes Collecting Banners will automatically take a Mobile Respawn Beacon in an ally deathbox if possible (will not replace current survival item). SKILL DISPLAY IMPROVEMENTS {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d2b22a4c5da644c76d5fca809cb6fb6e9f543546.png Into the Rift is bringing nostalgia, but we’re also bringing something new: skill display improvements. This new feature will display the balancing of each match and update live as each player loads into the match—giving you a true rank distribution of all players. This is just the latest in our ongoing evaluation and improvement of Ranked. Players were looking for more insights and fairness in their matches and this is our next step.

        "contents": "Hey Legends, We’re sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends. Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior anti-cheat dev blog, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we’re battling cheaters—this is one to add to the list. We remain committed to more regular updates on topics like this and appreciate your continued reports. Read on to hear from our Anti-Cheat Team. --- What’s happening? In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game. Linux is used by default on the Steam Deck. There is currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux). Decision making process The openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers. Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention. We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today. Next steps To eliminate this cheat vector, we have made the decision to prevent access to the game for Linux users. This means that Apex Legends will be unplayable immediately for those running this operating system. Playing on handhelds, such as the Steam Deck, is still possible if the user opts to install Windows. To clarify, this will not impact users who play Apex via Steam on Windows (or other supported platforms). Thanks for everyone’s continual support and we look forward to sharing future anti-cheat updates! --- This is only a part of our ongoing efforts towards Apex’s anti-cheat. We are continually expanding and refining our detection and banning capabilities globally. Keep an eye out for more news to come in the future. Please continue to report cheaters using the designated tools and channels. Your reports are helpful and matter to us and anti-cheat continues to be a top priority for us. For future updates and the latest info, continue to follow us here or check out the Apex Tracker Trello for bugs or concerns we’re investigating.",

        "contents": "We recently committed to more transparent and consistent communication, and our next topic is a big one. You hate cheating and so do we. It harms your experience and Apex Legends as a whole. While we work daily to stamp it out and get ahead of the next exploit or cheating evolution, it’s worth noting that this battle will never end. We’ve been active in this fight, but we haven’t been as successful as we’ve needed to be. So we’re stepping things up in multiple areas, including aiming to deliver noticeable improvements over time to protect the integrity of our game. It may go without saying, but we can’t share every detail. We’ve got to keep some cards close to our chest to avoid tipping off those who would work against us. HERE'S THE TLDR More than 6 million accounts have been banned since launch More than 100,000 accounts are banned each month on average Team Investments: we’ve expanded our anti-cheat team across the globe including additional 24/7 coverage and added dedicated talent in the particularly impacted Asia-Pacific region Currently use a kernel-level anti-cheat service and multiple incremental layers of protection We’ve improved our processes, rolled out additional capabilities, and are continuing to deploy new tools and technologies faster than ever Current State Apex is a high-skill, competitive experience which makes maintaining its integrity critical. Since its launch in 2019, we have banned more than 6 million accounts. That number will continue to grow as we average more than 100,000 bans monthly. We continue to regularly issue ban waves and also take individual actions in-between waves as needed. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/5ad4dcba3e28e0f77817b8f488a5ef4edf4c1848.png We know from our monitoring, from you, and from our own play, that there is more work to do. As we move forward, we will do our best to provide updates with more posts on anti-cheat efforts and progress. TEAM INVESTMENTS Respawn employs a team of specialists that monitor game play and can take action against bad actors when needed. This can include (but isn’t limited to) recording prohibited behavior, muting those being problematic in chat (both text and audio), removing players mid-match, and/or issuing appropriate bans when applicable. The human component to successful anti-cheat efforts is important. To help in that regard, we’ve expanded our team to improve 24/7 coverage and are now better equipped to monitor, quickly review, and take corrective actions on cheating reports. We’ve grown our anti-cheat team in targeted regions, like Asia-Pacific, that have been particularly hard-hit by global cheating activity. TOOLS & TECHNOLOGY Apex uses Easy Anti-Cheat (“EAC”)—a kernel level anti-cheat service that helps identify cheating activity and automates corrective actions. We also employ additional layers of protections designed to detect, disrupt, and disable cheating software. Some of these are industry standard, while others are developed here at Respawn and are specific to our needs. We can’t share specifics on these tools, but they have improved our match review capabilities, and allow us to evaluate flagged instances faster and more effectively. We’re staffed and dedicated to deploying new tools and updates more quickly to help build strength and speed in the fight against cheating. THANKS FOR YOUR REPORTS Alongside our growing teams and better technology, each and every community report can help us get ahead. You’re in the thick of it after all. With our recent changes, we can act faster and make more of an impact in real-time. When you see cheating in Apex, please report it. In a future update, we hope to close the feedback loop and let you know what action we’ve taken more quickly. If you’re unable to report in-game, you can also report players via EA Help For concerns regarding game vulnerabilities or anti-cheat by-passes, report via our CVD program The above are the official methods for reporting as they promote the inclusion of optimal details for the team to take action. Should more reporting channels become available in the future, we will share them OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU We share your concerns about cheating in Apex, and it remains a top priority that we’re attacking every day. As we continue to make things better, we’ll be updating you regularly on this battle across our regular social platforms (including the new Game Status section on Trello). It’s worth reiterating that this is at its heart a security issue, so details may occasionally be limited. Cheers again for your continued support and reports. It never ceases to amaze us how passionate y’all are and we appreciate it immensely. ",

NEW MAP: E-DISTRICT {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/518e919fab3a3f579889e80f647ca04bc9a4ba75.png This map was designed to offer players a fresh and innovative experience. While it retains the core elements that define a great Apex map, we also pushed the boundaries by incorporating numerous buildings, emphasizing verticality, and creating varied landscapes. These changes ensure some of the most diverse fights and end-ring locations across the map. Read the full breakdown of this latest map addition in our Welcome to E-District blog here. SHOCKWAVE MAP ROTATION The following maps will be available in Pubs and Ranked for the first half of this season: Broken Moon E-District Storm Point As an introduction to our newest map, E-District will be the dedicated featured map for a limited time. Let the energy of the neon lights energize your squad with each Pub match for the first week and each Ranked match for the first 72 hours of the season. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/11b618f541b95b60e9c75eb56f6f756a68c2981f.png CONTROLLER & RECON CLASS PERKS This season we’re beginning a much more intentional push on what classes mean to the core of the game by bringing new tactical class passives to the Controller and Recon classes. Both will continue to bring strategic depth to their squad via interactions with Survey Beacons and Ring Consoles, but they’ll now have new intrinsic power that better supports their role on the team. CONTROLLER CLASS NEW CLASS PERK Zone Overcharge: Controller Legends now have extra shield capacity when playing in zone The Zone automatically grants an overcharge of 25HP shield capacity This capacity is permanent while the player remains in zone (white ring area on the map) Overcharge is lost when leaving zone (after 5s delay) Overcharge can be healed with cells, batteries and abilities while in zone If a player enters the zone at full shields, the overcharge pip will fill automatically If a player acquires a shield core that overcharges beyond this extra zone capacity, that additional overcharge will still drain normally but the zone overcharge will remain Zone Overcharge will never enhance Legend Armor beyond maximum (red) capacity NEW QUALITY OF LIFE Remote Pick-Up: Controller Legends can now remotely pick-up their undamaged Tacticals by looking back at them and pressing a button Additionally, if the player abandons the area, they will prompted to recover ALL possible objects Remotely recovering these objects will restore the Tactical charge Dev Note: Controller Legends are at their best when playing for zone position. This season, we’re rewarding that behavior in Legends who don’t want to skim the edges of battle hunting for EVO, and instead allow them to maintain an equal footing on their armor when playing to their strengths. Gaining knowledge of the next ring and keeping a good position will be important to maintaining this advantage. Additionally, we noticed that many newer players to the Controller Class struggle with management of their Tacticals. This takes a step towards making it more desirable to experiment with traps or to feel more comfortable setting up shop with less worry about having to abandon your entire setup to move to a slightly better building. We want Controller players to play with their kit more freely and not have to do extra running around to recycle charges or feel locked into their setup if they have to move. RECON CLASS NEW CLASS PERK Threat Vision: Recon Legends now gain threat vision when aiming down sights Threat vision will highlight enemies that the character has Line of Sight to whenever using ADS (aim down sights) This ability will not work through walls or smoke, and it’s limited in range by the type of scope or zoom range of an ability SURVEY BEACONS Faster to use ~3s (was ~7.5s) Shortened range of ~500m (was scanning the entire map) No longer randomly distributed and all will now be turned on with every map Scanning now grants 75 EVO (was 200 EVO) Now pulses 3 times over 15s, with each pulse taking a snapshot of enemies in range for 5s Now release a large in-world scan wave that players can spot to identify an activated beacon (enemies no longer receive a scan message) Enemies scanned will display along the edges of the mini-map even if not in Dev Note: Recon Legends are defined as Legends who are about Enemy Intel & Tracking; which is a core part of each character’s play pattern, but to date, the only class benefit was something players had to seek out via Survey Beacons. We’re ratcheting up the scouting role for Recon Legends this season and putting class power directly into their hands. With ADS Threat Vision, these characters are now adept at spotting distant targets for their team, and now innately do something that no other class can. The changes to Survey Beacons should allow players to make them a more tactical part of their play, rather than just a strategic element. The full map scan was really only useful to a small number of high level players, and often the scan messaging would turn your team into a magnet for others to hunt. Now, being more frequent, faster to use, and giving more intel for longer makes it easier to use the beacons with confidence and hunt in the immediate area or note secure paths out of a POI for rotation. UPDATE: STAT TRACKERS We've made a huge quality of life upgrade to Stat Trackers and are separating out the Stat and the Art. You'll now be able to set these on your Legend Banner Cards separately. The Art on your trackers have also been made universal, which means they can be applied to any Legend Banner Card. We wanted to give players more ways to customize their Banner Cards and let you show off your more than just one Legend there. It’s also a great way to show off your Legend ships! Login at any point during Shockwave to automatically unlock three new Stat Trackers to add to your mix and match collection. SHOCKWAVE BATTLE PASS For a summary of the updated Battle Pass offerings, please check out our dedicated blog and infographic here. Here's a TLDR: With the launch of Season 22 on August 6th through Split 1, we want to give you an opportunity to get the Premium Battle Pass. You can unlock it by completing a series of simple in-game challenges before the end of Split 1 on September 17th at 10:00am PT: Play 2 matches in Trios on a specific map Deal 1,000 damage as a Recon or Controller Legend in BR Open 15 Supply Bins in any mode Deal 500 damage in BR with a specific weapon Complete 10 levels of the Battle Pass Starting with Split 2 on September 17th, you can get the Premium Battle Passes the same way as before: by using 950 Apex Coins. You’ll be able to earn enough Apex Coins via the Battle Pass to get future passes. The Battle Pass options now include better rewards—and with the re-tuned Battle Pass challenges, it'll be faster to complete at only 60 levels. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/949e4f02a1492e74959f9db78caf2cd780890ce4.png PATCH NOTES BALANCE UPDATES Care Package EVA-8 returns to the floor Blast pattern size slightly increased Damage increased to 7 (was 6) Fire rate decreased Now takes Boosted Loader Hop-Up 4 shots remaining activation Quick reload overflows Magazine by 2 Slight increase to recoil R-99 enters the Care Package ADS strafe speed increased Improved recoil New Feature: Damage fall-off Damage increased to 14 at close range Damage falls off to 10 at 11+ meters No movement penalty when equipped EVO Cache Spawn Rate in the first wave increased to 100% (was 50%) Gold Weapon Rotation Mozambique Akimbo, P2020 Akimbo, R-301, Rampage, Sentinel GAMEPLAY UPDATES Aim Assist Console crossplay into PC lobbies: Aim Assist strength reduced 18% Console performance mode crossplay into PC lobbies: Aim Assist strength reduced 22% Controller on PC: Aim Assist strength reduced 25% Dev Note: We value our accessibility as a cross-platform game, but it's equally important for us to monitor that ecosystem. Experiential stories from all types of players tracks with the data we're seeing when it comes to encounter win rate between different peripherals. Apex Legends is a competitive shooter, and simply put, aim assist is too strong. Aim assist will never be removed as it's a critical accessibility feature. Console lobbies remain unaffected; this only impacts players on controllers in PC lobbies (our most competitive ecosystem). This change doesn't solve the intricacies of all aim assist hot topics, but it should help level the playing ground. Aim Flinch Aim Flinch has been removed from all weapons & most abilities Damage from the ring still incurs Aim Flinch Dev Note: Let's be honest, no one really had love for Aim Flinch. We’ve made the call to eliminate it from all weapons and most Legend abilities. However there are some Legend abilities that do benefit from the added feedback like dunking on someone with a Newcastle ult. We’ll keep an eye on abilities that may need additional feedback as we see how this change affects the game. Loot Bin Reset Starting with Shockwave, all loot bins will close and reroll their loot with a significantly increased chance at high tier and rare loot at the mid-way point of the match. Bins that have been rerolled will appear slightly differently than ones that have never been opened After the reset, multiple bins will convert into Legendary loot bins that provide smart loot, guaranteeing that the contents to be relevant upgrades for a squad Mythic Bin One Mythic bin will spawn into the match with: One random Care Package weapon Gold version weapons of those that the squad is running at the time of opening the bin Medical supplies and grenades Large EVO bonus to the squad Mythic bins are locked and require players to hold interact on them for a significant amount of time to crack them open for their team Displayed on the map and minimap Loot Pool Reduce the spawn rate of Purple and Gold attachments by about 50% Dev Note: Access to high tier attachments in the early game have started to feel too common which results in squashing the power progression over the course of a match. By reducing the amount of high tier loot in the early game players will be fighting on more even terms. To compensate for this reduction, “Loot Bin Reset” improves the overall quality of loot in the world which should provide a much smoother transition to end game power. Reorganization: Death Boxes and Loba’s Black Market Healing items now have a dedicated row and have been removed from the consumables category Shield Cores have been moved to the top of the Gear category Dev Note: These items are critical to a player’s success in the outlands, bringing them up to the top with consistent positions should expedite the looting process and eliminate some tedious scrolling for players. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/29cf173965579cc3551d06e7eebef71b67834af7.png Traversal Mantling at the same time in the same spot as a teammate no longer forces both players to drop BATTLE SENSE Better Ammo Awareness & Feedback Critical Ammo state will now kick on when a player has 0 relevant ammo in their inventory On screen Low Ammo indicators kick on earlier allowing players more opportunity to find ammo Indicator also now displays the icon of the ammo type Pinging for ammo will now display the ammo icon in the kill feed When emptying a weapon of all reserve ammo it will now automatically ping that the player is in need of ammo When looking at ammo on the ground the tooltip now displays compatibility with any of your currently equipped weapons Dev Note: Running out of ammo is never fun and our low ammo states were set up in a way that didn’t provide much time or information for players to action on. These changes intend to set players up for more success when it comes to maintaining their ammo economy. Enemy Health Bars When damaging an enemy, players are now shown the enemy’s Armor and Health state. This Health Bar is only active for a brief time after dealing damage and then fades away. Health Bars, like Enemy Highlights require direct line of sight. Enemy Highlight Enemy players will now be highlighted with a red outline similar to how allies are highlighted with a blue one. The highlight is most prominent at close ranges and the intensity fades as targets get farther away. Enemy Highlights require direct line of sight (you can breathe now, Bangalore mains). Both Enemy Health Bars and Enemy Highlights can be toggled on/off in Settings. Dev Note: Visual clarity and accurate information are imperative to a player’s success. These new features, Highlighting and Health Bars, are intended to level the playing field and combat the intensity of battle. No one likes mag dumping into their squadmates back because they totally thought that was the enemy Lifeline. Experienced players can easily develop the skill to call out health values of enemies based on the amount of damage they are dealing and the various shield levels but for newer players this can be a difficult task. Providing a visual aid for such critical information we hope evens the playing field a bit and can provide accurate and actionable information that can be relayed to the whole squad. You can really call out that “they’re one!”. AMMO & ATTACHMENTS Ammo Spawn rates Energy ammo: reduced individual spawn rate Light & Heavy ammo: slight increase to individual spawn rate Shotgun & Sniper ammo: increased individual spawn rate Ammo Stack Changes Light ammo stack size increased to 72 (was 60) Individual brick size increased to 24 (was 20) Energy ammo stack size decreased to 54 (was 60) Individual brick size decreased to 18 (was 20) Shotgun ammo stack size increased to 20 (was 16) Individual brick size increased to 10 (was 8) Dev Note: Light ammo weapons have been overshadowed by our Heavy and Energy arsenal the last few seasons. With this set of changes we’re hoping the ammo economy for Light will improve their viability and earn back a place in player’s loadouts. Hop-ups Disruptor Rounds removed from floor loot New Hop-Up: Gun Shield Generator Usable by all LMGs (Spitfire, Rampage, L-STAR, Devotion) When aiming down sights automatically deploy a frontal Gun Shield Gun Shield absorbs 40 damage Gun Shield is recharged 12 seconds after taking damage or breaking Improves Gibraltar’s Gun Shield Gun Shield health increased to 75 Gun Shield recharge time remains the same as his passive READ THE REST OF THE PATCH NOTES HERE",

        "contents": "NEW UPDATES COMING WITH APEX LEGENDS™: SHOCKWAVE We all need a jumpstart occasionally, Legends. Nothing too shocking, but you may still want to ground yourself first. Shockwave is fully charged and ready to light up your time in the Outlands. The energy is palpable with the new respawn mechanic in Trios Revival (and Straight Shot Revival in our first event of the season), allowing you and the squad to get back into the fight sooner. Why not take a trip to E-District, our latest map, where it’s always lit with neon lights. Or light things up yourself with the all-new Akimbo by dual-wielding P2020s or Mozambiques for extra firepower. Don’t get it twisted. The Apex Games are no vacation. Keep your wits about you with Battle Sense: enemy health bars and highlights become temporarily visible after you deal damage. Whether you’re new, returning, or looking for a change of pace, you can warm up, practice, and hone your skills in the new Bot Royale mode where you'll face bots in a condensed Battle Royale experience. NEW: TRIOS REVIVAL {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/1c2455de543369ce1bdfe5c801917340328d54c8.jpg Stay in the game longer with Revival: a new twist on respawning without banners or respawn beacons. As long as one squadmate still stands, you’ll automatically respawn based on a timer until the fourth ring. But it’s never that easy. Your respawn timer will increase with each death and each round; and if you and another are both down, you’ll respawn together with the earliest timer. Any living squadmate can speed up the timer by taking aggressive action like doing damage, downing enemies, and eliminating them. Revival kicks off with pub Trios when Shockwave launches on August 6, 2024, and Straight Shot will also be getting the Revival spark shortly after launch with the first event of the season. NEW MAP: E-DISTRICT {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/13e899163b10bffa318ca73ecdd0760a40d398a2.jpg Set your sights on a new site: E-District, a map built for verticality and instant, continuous action. This densely packed urban oasis has seen blackouts, riots, and a chemical attack at Humbert Labs all in its recent past. Now, thanks to the generosity of the Mercenary Syndicate, it’s been cleaned, powered up, and transformed for your entertainment. Every block of this high-rise battleground has a story to tell. Where will you build yours? Check out our full Welcome to E-District blog tomorrow, August 2, for a full overview of all the details. NEW WEAPON: AKIMBO {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/62aa8ea0be885d2db8cbad86c6ae7adb8e80b384.jpg Akimbo has made it to the Outlands! Dual wield two P2020s or two Mozambiques (not one of each) this season. Find and interact with a second P2020 or Mozambique and to automatically enter Akimbo mode. In Akimbo, both the P2020s and Mozambiques will benefit from automatic firing and increased rate of fire. Attachments will be mirrored to the second weapon (no need to find two light magazines or bolts), however optics will be disabled. Magazine size while in Akimbo is doubled compared to the single version but will incur longer reload times. When aiming instead of looking down the sights you’ll instead tighten their hipfire spread. Opt back into the single version of these weapons by toggling their select fire which will holster the second weapon and re-enable their optic. UPDATE: BATTLE SENSE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d33f3b001036bd1d64f6fc8dc2c9e90450899df9.jpg It’s always best to keep your wits about you in the heat of battle. With Shockwave, we’re growing Battle Sense with two new features: temporary health bars and highlights that appear while you’re dealing damage to an enemy. But keep your eyes on the elimination prize—if you lose line of sight, the health bar disappears. Enemies will also be highlighted in red, making them easier to spot against the landscape around them and differentiate them from your squadmates. NEW: WELCOME PASS & CHALLENGES With the launch of Shockwave, new players coming to Apex will receive the new Welcome Pass. The Welcome Pass is a unique set of challenges designed to help new players learn foundational skills to be successful in Battle Royale. Complete challenges to make your way through the track to earn cosmetics and Legend Tokens to unlock a Legend of their choice upon completion. All challenges in this track can be completed in Bot Royale or Battle Royale modes, and you’ll unlock additional sets of challenges as you progress. NEW: BOT ROYALE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/68e3dcf3c905c754021ef012ae86c5534597738e.jpg Whether you’re a new player, a returning player, or just looking to get good, this new mode is the perfect arena to learn, practice, and perfect your playstyle outside of pubs and Ranked. Play by yourself with bot squadmates or fill out a fully human squad to take on a smaller lobby of eight enemy bot squads. And don’t worry about the MRVNs, they’ll be fine. Just dominate like the Legend you’ve always been. SEE YOU ON THE DROPSHIP Shockwave is fully energized with Revival, E-District, Akimbo, Battle Sense, Bot Royale, and more. We’re just getting charged up. Our Welcome to E-District and Patch Notes blogs coming over the next few days are full of details you don’t want to miss. And keep your eyes on socials for more inside scoops from devs and behind the scenes content. Time to Tap in, Legends. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/",

We recognize that we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better—that's on us. It’s our intention to improve the overall value and experience across our Battle Pass offerings. For a summary of the updated Battle Pass offerings starting with Season 22 Split 2 on September 17th, please check out the infographic. Here's what we'd like you to know: With the launch of Season 22 on August 6th through Split 1, we want to give you an opportunity to get the Premium Battle Pass. You can unlock it by completing a series of simple in-game challenges. Starting with Split 2 on September 17th, you can get the Premium Battle Passes the same way as before: by using 950 Apex Coins. You’ll be able to earn enough Apex Coins via the Battle Pass to get future passes. The Battle Pass options now include better rewards—and with the re-tuned Battle Pass challenges, it'll be faster to complete at only 60 levels. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/ea220b91fcf63f1b8c9a12d62cd865fe9107c65d.jpg Moving forward, we recognize that we need to be more timely, transparent, and consistent in our communications with you. Your priorities are our priorities: cheaters, game stability, and quality of life updates are top of mind. We need to get better and it's why we're acknowledging them here. As a next step, there are a number of improvements and game stability bug fixes coming in Season 22 that will be outlined in the Patch Notes dropping on August 5th. Thank you again for all of your passion and time in Apex Legends, because we couldn’t do this without you. - The Apex Legends Team ",

Oh, and they'll also only be avialable for real money, rather than being purchasable using Apex Coins. Players aren't fans of these proposed changes, as you'd expect. The plans, which are currently slated to kick off with Season 22, were outlined in a <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/de-de/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update\">blog post</a>. Basically, the gist is that rather than one season-long battle pass as has been the case up until now, the game will offer two half-season ones, with one kicking off the season and another taking over at its halfway point. The big sticking point is that this switch is being deployed alongside another big one - battle passes will no longer be buyable using in-game Apex points, instead each costing $9.99 each that you won't have the option to simply earn by playing the game. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-battle-pass-changes-real-money-players-fuming\">Read more</a> ",

And you already know that there’s a fresh batch of skins. Collect all 24 mind-bending event cosmetics before the event ends to receive Lifeline’s Prestige Skin, “Apex Corruptor.” Plus, earn 1.5x towards Prestige Skin Challenges during the entire event! QUADS TAKEOVER No longer will you have to decide which of your three friends will be in your squad for the Apex Games. Bring all three! Until the end of the season, your squad of four will take on 14 other squads in an attempt to become the Apex Champions. Team compositions? They’re a whole other vibe with a fourth. Strategies to outsmart and outplay your opponents? We hope you’ve got your comms down. This is a new gen of Apex. The loot pool has also been updated to avoid in-fighting for ammo, attachments, and regen items. You may even have a small chance to obtain a Blue or Purple kitted weapon! Unfortunately, Tridents are too small to squeeze a fourth on board, but let ‘em walk. If you’re more of a team player, there’s always Evac Towers or Valkyrie’s Ult. And Skyward Dive, along with other Legend abilities, have also been updated to support a fourth. COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS First things first: direct unlock is back. All 24 Double Take limited-time cosmetics can be unlocked via event packs† or individually. And we’re bringing a ton of Legendary skins for this one: Octane, Crypto, Fuse, Conduit, Revenant, everyone’s new fav Alter, and an arsenal of weapons including one for the Havoc (which a lot of you have been using lately).

RANKED RUMBLE Finish off your Ranked season by finding out who takes the top in our very first Ranked Rumble: August 3 to August 6, 2024. Upheaval’s regular Ranked season will be shorter when Ranked Rumble takes over, but this is all about the best of the best. Each Rank Tier will qualify for their very own leaderboard, with each one having an unique badge that can be earned. Squad up with your friends to complete your 10 Ranked Rumble Matches, pushing your score and placement as high as possible. No need to opt-in. Everyone who has already achieved a rank this season is auto-eligible. Your Ranked Rumble placement will have no impact on your RP or Ranked Season placement or rewards. Those are locked in before the Ranked Rumble becomes available. How will YOU stack up against everyone else in your Rank?

        "contents": "NEW UPDATES COMING WITH APEX LEGENDS™: UPHEAVAL Want to watch the world burn, Legends? Get ready to disturb the peace, because upheaval is upon us! Bend the world with Alter and her Void-based abilities, then sow chaos in Solos Takeover—with kitted guns and new ways to dodge (and deal) death. Descend into a new age of Broken Moon, unearthing new POIs and faster paths to mayhem. More fights? That just means more opportunities to slice in style with the latest customizable Apex Artifacts. It’s time to sew mayhem across the Outlands, so let’s get to it! TAKEOVER: SOLOS https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/upheaval-game-updates/r5-s21-launch-portalambush-b-v02-1.png.adapt.1920w.png Well, well, well…looks like Solos is coming back after all! Replacing Duos from the beginning of the season, take on the Outlands by yourself in this revamped variant. We’ve taken aspects of some of our most popular modes and integrated them to keep things interesting: use your Battle Sense to detect nearby enemies, tear things up with pre-kitted weapons and attachments, and keep the fight going with auto heal and Second Chance mechanics. We get it–sometimes you want to drop hot and heavy without having to carry the squad. It’s every Legend for themselves…for now. Solos Takeover is live May 7, 2024 to June 24, 2024. NEW LEGEND: ALTER https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/upheaval-game-updates/r5-s21-launch-alterbase-v03-1.png.adapt.1920w.png When Alter emerged from her dimension into another with her past held close to the chest, she had only two things: her interdimensional traveling Void tech, and a desire to have fun. She did what she wanted when she wanted, never needing to stick around for the consequences of her actions. Morality and responsibility were things of the past as Alter traveled throughout different realities, drawn to worlds on the edge of complete destruction. Whether something devastating was already happening or she helped usher in the apocalypse herself, Alter was always there to watch whatever catastrophe ensued. She loved seeing worlds end and seeing the true nature of the people come out within the chaos. However, in some ruined dimensions, there was a common denominator that intrigued her–one that would lead her to witness the grandest apocalypse of all. Seeking out the next world it would condemn, Alter has landed in ours, ready to do what’s necessary to see her wish fulfilled. PASSIVE: GIFT FROM THE RIFT Alter can see and remotely interact with nearby death boxes to claim a single item. While she cannot take shield cores through the void, any other prize can be snatched from afar. TACTICAL: VOID PASSAGE Alter fires a void blast from her tail that shatters against a surface to open a dimensional gateway through from one side to the other for a short time. Crossing through the portal is instantaneous, and can be done from either direction, but travelers will remain phased briefly after exiting. The angle of this shot determines what surface the exit will open on and can be used to open passages through ceilings and ledges, allowing Alter to place her passages creatively through the environment. ULTIMATE: VOID NEXUS Alter can deploy a Void Nexus that allies can remotely interact with to open a phase tunnel back to that point. When a tunnel is opened, that player will phase walk from their location to the Void Nexus and leave behind a portal that any player can follow through. The Nexus can be used even while downed, and it is an incredible way for Alter and her squad to regroup to a position of power for a reset, provided interlopers do not pursue… APEX ARTIFACTS https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/upheaval-game-updates/r5-s21-launch-action-lineupartifacts-v03-1.png.adapt.1920w.png The pantheon of Apex Artifacts is expanding. Check out our dedicated blog for all things Apex Artifacts including lore connections and customizations. MAP UPDATE: BROKEN MOON Our goals for the Upheaval update were to bring a new combat experience throughout Broken Moon and within the new POIs, while also changing the identity of the map. Detached and now floating in outer space between Cleo and Boreas, the colony of Hope is forever changed. The Terraformer has had to recalculate and adapt which has, in turn, mutated familiar biomes and created an exotic landscape. QUARANTINE ZONE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/upheaval-game-updates/s21-bm-quarantine-zone-2.png Where Promenade East met West is now the Quarantine Zone. Promenade was wiped out by the Stasis Array Node that crashed down to the map. When what appeared to be Olympus collided with the Stasis Net satellite, Broken Moon’s protection was no longer—allowing the crash debris and meteors to rain down along with unknown biological material that has required the area to be quarantined. From a game design perspective, the goal was to deliver a faster-paced and more deliberate combat experience. We condensed the whole center of the map, making it more predictable where players can and cannot rotate from. The layout of this POI makes for fast pace looting, combat, and some fun action with the covered ziprail loop, while also providing a safe rotation from teams at the lower end. BREAKER WHARF https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/upheaval-game-updates/s21-bm-breaker-wharf-2.png Breaker Wharf was also affected by the debris raining down, which gave us some room to play. Because this POI was so secluded from the rest, we felt that there was an opportunity to move it – and move it did! Now, look out for it where the Backup Atmostation was. This design change is one that aims to break up the playstyle of this side of the map, where there were a lot of science buildings that played in a similar manner. Bringing over a more industrial kit will help break that repetitiveness, offering more gameplay variety to players. SPACE PORT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/upheaval-game-updates/s21-bm-space-port-2.png Space Port is a smaller POI that breaks the mold of the original larger POIs and sits in the area that once was Breaker Wharf (recreated by the mobilization to help keep Broken Moon alive and together). It serves a bigger purpose to bring more action to spaces less-traveled, and is the perfect drop for one team to get some good loot. SEE YOU ON THE DROPSHIP With Broken Moon rising from the rubble, the long awaited return of Solos, a fresh pantheon of Apex Artifacts, and a brand new Legend, this season is just beginning. Strap in, Legends, who knows what will awaken when peace is disturbed. One more time with feeling: the upheaval is upon us. https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/upheaval-game-updates/",

From hardcore tactical shooters like Rainbow Six Siege to behemoths like Call of Duty Warzone, this is our list of the <strong>best FPS games </strong>you can play right now on console. Nailing an FPS game is no easy task, and the developers behind these games are experts in their craft. While FPS games are often criticized for being samey or looking generic, we couldn't disagree more, and this list proves it.

Respawn says it’s putting out a series of updates to the game designed to help keep people safe. Yup, following the <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-algs-hack-risk-speculation\">postponement of the North American finals of the Apex Legends Global Series due to some participants being given aimbots and the ability to see through walls</a>, we’ve all been waiting for the game’s developers to address what that might mean for the rest of us. After both Epic Games and the company behind the game’s anti-cheat software shot down one theory as to the cause of the hacks following their own investigations, that answer’s now arrived from Respawn. In a statement posted to Twitter, Respawn has provided an update from the Apex team. &ldquo;On Sunday, a few professional Apex Legends player accounts were hacked during an ALGS event,&rdquo; it confirms, continuing: &ldquo;Game and player security are our highest priorities, which is why we paused the competition to address the issue immediately.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-respawn-updates-coming-algs-hacks?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam\">Read more</a> ",

That said, following some incidents of hackers giving pro players some competitive advantages they didn’t ask for, players are currently concerned that they might be at risk of having something similar happen to them. Yup, the North American finals of the Apex Legends Global Series - a competition that sees people who’re very good at shooting each other, well, shoot each other - have recently had to be postponed midway through because people were getting unexpected help. It looks like an exploit being used on the game’s anti-cheat measures could be to blame, but it’s probably best to take a break until that’s officially confirmed or denied. What happened to kick all of this off? Well, Apex pro Noyan Ozkose, who goes by the handle Genburten, suddenly found himself able to see every other player in his session, despite there being, you know, walls in between them and him. It looks like he was basically forced to hop straight out of the match once he realised what was going on, which is a pretty big headache. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-algs-hack-risk-speculation?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam\">Read more</a> ",

Hunts are available across the map and can be activated at any time during the match. Initiate a Hunt and let the tracking begin! Enemy squads will be randomly selected and marked as Prey for a limited-time. Keep a watchful eye as Hunters will receive updated tracking data while they’re on the prowl. And tread lightly, your Prey will be warned once you’re within a dangerous range of them (~70m). Each time a Hunt is activated, another squad is selected to be the Hunters and a second one becomes the Prey. Succeed in your tracking for a bonus reward, but if you fall to your Prey then the reward will be bestowed upon them instead. Don’t stay still for long, your squad could be next.

Complete all Breakout Rewards Challenges before the season ends to unlock more rewards like the Reactive “Top Tier” Flatline and the Legendary “Runaway Renegade” Wraith. Check out the full breakdown, including Legends and chase rewards, in our Breakout Rewards blog. https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/breakout-rewards BREAKOUT MAP ROTATION https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/breakout-patch-notes/s20-launch-map-worldsedge-r01-v01.png.adapt.1920w.png The following maps will be available in Trios and Duos for the season: Olympus Storm Point World’s Edge PERFORMANCE MODE: 120HZ On PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X, the Video Settings menu has a new “Performance” mode option that is available to players with 120Hz displays. This option targets 120 FPS performance with content optimizations and reductions to visual quality. To achieve 120 FPS, current-gen consoles now run on a new multithreaded rendering system, built on top of the Rendering Hardware Interface (RHI). Previously, even with GPU optimizations, the Apex rendering engine has been bottlenecked by single-threaded rendering code, which could not scale to the capabilities of modern hardware. This new system allows us to fully utilize the GPU and forms the foundation for future improvements to the rendering engine. CRAFTING Breakout brings a complete rework to Crafting, streamlining the system. Welcome to Crafting 2.0, legends! Replicators have quite a few changes, including a fancy new paint job. They are now free to use, and no longer require crafting materials—we’ve removed them and crafting rotations. When you open the crafting menu, you’ll see that the available options have been reduced: Shield Battery, Medkit, Ammo, and Player Banners. Printing any item will exhaust that replicator specifically for you. You’ll need to find another one if you want another item, so choose wisely. To offset the single-use system, the number of available Replicators have been increased across the board. Every game will start with 12 Replicators spawned at the start of the match, with an additional Replicator airdrop at the start of Round 4 to add some late-game opportunities. We’re also including a few quality of life changes for Crafting: Decreased interaction time with Replicators Inventory can now be accessed from the crafting menu Printed items left alone will auto-eject from the Replicator after some time WORLD’S EDGE: RAMPART’S BIG MAUDE With crafting materials gone, Rampart has been figuring out how to get more customers through her door, and what better way than with a Fire Sale! All Big Maude paintball weapons are now free, but they will take time to dispense from their vending machines. Once a player has claimed their free weapon, they cannot get another. Loba will still be able to steal a second gun with her Black Market. There is also an increased variety of weapons to choose from, but gold kitted weapons are no longer offered at Big Maude. LEGEND UPGRADES https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/breakout-patch-notes/legend-upgrades.png.adapt.1920w.png This season we’re introducing the Legend Upgrade system for BR modes—an in-match progression system that deepens the Apex Legends experience by allowing you to tailor your Legend to your playstyle. Players will gain EVO points in a variety of new ways across the Battle Royale to level-up not just your armor, but your Legend—unlocking unique ability upgrades at Levels 2 and 3. With each match being a fresh start, the plethora of possibilities adds a new level of strategy and meta. Check out our Breakout Highlights blog for the full breakdown on Legend Upgrades. https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/breakout-season-game-updates For full Patch Notes check out our blog here: https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/breakout-patch-notes ",

Drop hotter and hit different with Legend Upgrades—a new system that puts the meta in your hands by unlocking enhancements for armor and abilities. Each match is a fresh start and there’s no better time than now to try new strats on for size. Ranked returns reloaded and ready, tuned to a high-risk high-reward system that incentivizes combat through each split—yup, splits are back. Plus, make your Thunderdome debut in Mixtape, the Frontier’s deadliest entertainment venue. And that’s not all—Performance Mode, Breakout Rewards, a 5th Anniversary Collection Event, and even more. We’re bringing the noise for a fantastic 5th Anniversary season. LEGEND UPGRADES {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/bd89e0b356569a8c76046a5ea9705561f2fe3135.png Introducing the Legend Upgrade system—an in-match progression system that deepens the Apex Legends Battle Royale experience by allowing you to tailor your Legend to your playstyle. This new feature will restart with each match, giving you the opportunity to try different upgrades on for size. Earning EVO will now Level-Up your Legend over the course of the game, improving your armor tier and unlocking unique upgrade selections at Levels 2 and 3. Choose wisely, as your decision can impact your whole squad’s strategy. Legend Upgrades and EVO changes will be limited to Battle Royale modes with Breakout. Stay tuned for our Breakout Patch Notes blog on February 12, 2024, for each Legend’s upgrade tree. RANKED RELOADED {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d7630abd7c25e6e19ed28e1a388ef50ca2aa5c84.jpg Scoring will be moving to a more transparent model similar to that of past seasons, placing a heavier emphasis on eliminations over placements. Your hidden skill rating will have no influence on either matchmaking or scoring. The bonus system has also been updated to provide more insight and Player Rankings will now be visible. We’ll also be returning to an improved Ranked Point system. With these changes, this also means that entry cost will return: 20 RP per Tier starting at Silver. ELIMINATION SCORING Elimination score continues scaling with placements—the value of each elimination will increase the higher your team places. There’ll be no hard cap placed on the number of eliminations a player will be scored on nor the amount of points gained from them. Instead, eliminations after the sixth will be worth half of their value. BONUSES There are a couple key bonuses that we want to call out with Breakout’s Ranked changes. Top 5 Streak Bonus: for maintaining a placement streak of 5th or better. Everytime you extend your streak you’ll earn 10RP more than your previous match, up to a maximum of a 40 RP bonus. 2 match streak: +10 RP 3 match streak: +20 RP 4 match streak: +30 RP 5+ match streak: +40 RP Challenger Bonus: earn a 50% bonus on an elimination of a higher ranked player when you’ve personally contributed. This bonus is unaffected by the elimination soft cap of 6 kills. MATCHMAKING We will be matchmaking based on RP values as closely as possible, and will not be using a tier-based lobby like prior seasons. Premade parties will be matched by the highest Ranked player’s ranking. TIER STRUCTURE This is another area that we monitored closely and considered all of your feedback, so there are a few changes with tiers for Breakouts Ranked: Promotional Trials have been removed Provisional Matches have been removed Demotion and Demotion Protection will remain the same as Ignite’s Ranked Ranked Tier RP requirements will have some increases NEW MIXTAPE MAP: THUNDERDOME {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/918fd87a0cda47dbf8dd02a51b80016e77f8e44d.jpg The deadliest entertainment venue is here: enter Thunderdome. Modernized with killer upgrades, this floating sky stadium is inspired by the first arena in Kings Canyon—capturing the essence of its Thunderdome, all while paying homage to the vast history of the Apex Games. Thunderdome is geared up for a fast-paced matchup in any Mixtape mode with its three lanes to pursue. Grind for the high ground in TDM, battle to see who can hold B in Control, or find one of many power positions to dominate in Gun Run. This latest map was created with a plethora of playstyles in mind and challenges the expected strats used by many. Win or lose, the dynamic stadium crowd will always keep up the good vibes. BREAKOUT REWARDS {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c6fc8bc311fc6e624de1cab1f2afd582b64f89d4.jpg We’re celebrating 5 years of Apex Legends with a series of rewards releasing throughout Breakout. Every two weeks we’ll be unlocking a Legend as free-to-play for the rest of the season. Each Legend will have a set of challenges to permanently unlock that Legend and earn Battle Pass Stars, with even more Legend themed rewards to collect. The 5th Anniversary has a lot to unwrap. Note: those that already have these Legends in their collection will still need to complete the challenges and other requirements in order to earn the cosmetic and chase rewards. CHASE REWARDS Conquer every Breakout Rewards challenge, hit Battle Pass Level 60, or gift six unique freebies before the season ends to unlock even more rewards like a Legendary Wraith skin. There are three chase items for completing three chase challenges: Complete all six sets of Legend Challenges → earn Legendary “Runaway Renegade” Wraith Collect all six Legend Banners in the free Battle Pass track → earn Wraith’s “Royal Stage” Banner Gift limited-time gifts at least six times → earn a Legendary Sticker and Rare Wraith Tracker set Each gifted Breakout Battle Pass also counts as a gift Complete all the Breakout Reward challenges to automatically earn the ultimate completion reward: the Reactive “Top Tier” Flatline. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/2c17aa88af79e193cf93ef0c32b7a806a6ced0aa.png 5TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION EVENT & NEW LTM {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/353f2e6729318d9dbd9e50b16a61b02cc3e99d30.png For the third consecutive year, we have another community-created reward tracker created by amazing Community Artists who teamed up with some of your favorite creators.

If we could do it all again, I'd want to have better infrastructure in place, so that we could scale up to manage the success.&rdquo; Perra explains that the studio was not expecting the 2019 battle royale title – the first, at the time, to really challenge Fortnite’s reign – to be as popular as it was. The game managed to attract 25 million players by the end of its first week, before wrapping up its first 30 days online with a massive <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-has-reached-50-million-players-in-4-weeks\">50 million registered players</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-launch-too-successful-interview?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam\">Read more</a> ",

A new event joins the party, as FINAL FANTASY™ VII Takeover replaces unranked BR. Defy destiny with the Buster Sword R2R5, with new abilities and a devastating Limit Break. Find Materia Hop-Ups that add effects like Lightning and more. Collect FINAL FANTASY™ VII REBIRTH-inspired skins for Wattson, Crypto, Wraith, and other Legends, kupo! Plus, collect 36 Event items including a new Death Box and the Mythic Buster Sword R5 Melee cosmetic—equippable by any Legend, in any mode. Unlike a Collection Event, there's a chance to get the Buster Sword R5 in every Event pack you open†. The Apex Legends & FINAL FANTASY™ VII REBIRTH Event brings two gaming icons to the same universe from January 9-30, 2024. So gather your crew and drop in, merc. Let’s mosey. NEW: FINAL FANTASY™ VII TAKEOVER Worlds collide in our new BR Takeover featuring content that will be all too familiar to FINAL FANTASY™ VII fans. Wield the power of a Buster Sword R2R5, which will have gameplay abilities and can be picked up and used as a weapon as a part of the Takeover. Get access to light and heavy attacks, blocking to reduce damage taken and dash to close the gap, and fill your meter to use the quintessential Limit Break. The more you deal, take, and block damage, the faster your meter will fill. If you don’t find a Buster Sword R2R5 hot off your drop, keep an eye out for them in Care Packages and around the map. While you’re on the hunt for the ultimate weapon, look for Materia Hop-Ups for increased effects and/or bonuses. Each Materia Hop-Up has its own impact and will only attach with select weapons, and can spawn in the world and event-limited Cactuar Ticks! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/a2ad5e537e32f0b4a16182c9b1aa09254db7b76b.png FINAL FANTASY™ VII REBIRTH COSMETICS Collect 36 items inspired by this first-ever crossover through dedicated Apex Legends & FINAL FANTASY™ VII REBIRTH Event packs†, with Iconic skins for Horizon and Newcastle, sticker sets, and more! Get a Four-Pack† for a guaranteed Legendary or Iconic item until all of those rarities are obtained. All 36 items (including the Buster Sword R5 Melee Cosmetic) will be randomly awarded via event packs† with no duplicates of event items. The Buster Sword R5 (unlike the Takeover’s Buster Sword R2R5) is a Universal Mythic Melee Cosmetic that has no gameplay abilities and can be equipped in place of your heirloom or fists. The sword will not be coming to the Mythic Shop after the event ends, so unlock it while you can! 6 Iconic Legend skins will also be available for direct purchase via the store. As you continue to collect items, keep an eye out for Milestone Rewards, given after each milestone on the event packs page is hit. Full Apex Legends & FINAL FANTASY™ VII REBIRTH Event packs† probability, Four-Pack guarantee, and pricing details available in-game. Complete your Apex Legends & FINAL FANTASY™ VII REBIRTH collection before the event ends and you’ll automatically receive the One-Winged Angel Death Box—a brand new cosmetic item to Apex Legends. Equip this with any Legend via the new Lobby Melee tab to transform the Death Box for every enemy you eliminate. GIL & REWARD SHOP Earn Gil, an event currency, while playing the event mode and completing challenges to use in the Rewards Shop to unlock event-limited items. The Reward Shop will rotate inventory weekly and feature select event items, badges, and more. Keep an eye out for event packs to help with your crossover collection. You can also use Gil to earn additional Battle Pass Stars to continue your seasonal progress. Challenges refresh daily and you'll want to complete as many as possible to earn the full amount of Gil.

In the years after, her home planet of Nexus established ties across the Outlands, introducing Rowenna to the Apex Games. The Games represented everything she aspired to–heroism, hard work, sacrifice—and she became a dedicated fan. When her elder sister Diwa suffered a terrible injury at work, Rowenna resolved to support her family no matter what. She stole the battery from the Monarch, still rusting on the hill, and had a combat rig built with its battery at the core. She used it to qualify for the Apex Games, and even though the battery exposes her to poisonous radiation, she refuses to give up. No one else was going to get hurt to support her family. Rowenna’s choosing to have hope for her dreams or die trying. Now, it’s Conduit’s chance for a day in the sun. Check out more on our newest and brightest Legend, Conduit, in our highlights blog and read on for details on her abilities. https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/ignite-season-game-updates PASSIVE: SAVIOR’S SPEED Gain a burst of speed when running toward a teammate out of Tactical range.

This notification will appear in the kill feed when a player in your current match has been removed. This alert will only be triggered by our anti-cheat systems and will not display when someone quits a match, loses connection or is kicked for AFK.

During a Trial, LP loss and gains are frozen, allowing the player to focus on completing the trial: Completing the conditions of a Trial within the given match count limit (either by winning a game or completing the alternative) will allow promotion into the next tier with a 250 LP promotional bonus Failing to complete the Trial within the match limit results in the Trial ending and a loss of LP based on the player’s performance Trials are time limited to 5 matches, increasing by 1 game each time a player fails and then reenters the same Trial, up to a max of 10 retries Promotional Trials are skipped during Provisional matches {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/b54c78326014d75a191a33446255dedf9fa1df47.png RANKED TUNING If you missed our recent reddit Dev Team Update, we’ve made some tuning adjustments for Ignite’s Ranked: Increasing the amount of Rating Bonus given to help players’ ranking catch up to their skill bracket Reduce the bonus that is withheld and thus the difficulty of climbing, when players are actively pushing against their skill ceiling Provisional Bonuses are adjusted to land players closer to the expected statistical 1.5 tier drop at the end of their 10 provisional games Ranking difference restrictions for 3 stack premades has been REMOVED.

        "contents": "NEW UPDATES COMING WITH APEX LEGENDS™: IGNITE It’s your Time to Shine in Apex Legends™: Ignite. With her shield-based abilities, let Conduit be your guiding light for regeneration and disruption. She’s the spark your squad needs to become Apex Champions on the faster and deadlier Storm Point. This tempest of a map has been overhauled with a reduced size and fresh Points of Interest like The Pylon, ZEUS Station, and Devastated Coast. Last but certainly not least, the team is excited to share that Cross Progression will be rolling out starting this season. Link your platforms to an EA Account to show off your skills no matter where you squad up. NEW LEGEND: CONDUIT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/ignite-season-game-updates/conduit-season-updates.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Conduit is like a firework–warm, bright, and short-lived. To rise quickly, Rowenna must don a combat rig made of an incomplete Monarch Titan that she knows is poisoning her. But it’s a price she’s willing to pay for her dream of being a Legend. At home, she’s the core of her large family. She smoothes over issues with her humor and sunny disposition all while hustling and sacrificing quietly–something that’s unchanged in the Games. Despite the fact she’s exchanging her life and health to be Conduit, Rowenna is having fun because she knows the Apex Games. Expert, fan, supporter–she’s there and she has the replays saved and filed, and her teammates and rivals know she’s there to win! STORM POINT MAP UPDATE Storm Point is a map that is loved by our competitive community for its more predictable pacing and high loot quality. However, some of the elements of Storm Point that make it a great competitive map can also make it more difficult to quickly find action during casual play. This brings us to the team's primary goal for this update, which is to improve the fun factor without sacrificing competitive integrity. To do this, we’ve taken the following actions: Add attractive, central POIs for players searching for combat. Wattson’s Pylon and CETO Station provide central hot drops for players looking to fight early. Reduce overall map size to improve mid-game pacing. Significant map size reductions to both the southern coastline and northern mountainous areas make these zones more attractive for early combat and reduce the overall distance between squads. Reduce friction of central rotations. With CETO Station replacing Prowler Island and a reworked Prowler-less Forbidden Zone, rotations through the center of map have never been smoother. IMC ARMORIES https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/ignite-season-game-updates/armory.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Unfortunately, the IMC Spectres failed to defend Storm Point from the storm, leaving only ravaged husks of the armories behind. Expect some high tier loot to remain – but the Spectres will no longer defend the spoils. REWORKED AREA: FORBIDDEN ZONE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/ignite-season-game-updates/forbidden.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg The Forbidden Zone was hit hard by lightning during the storm, destroying parts of the perimeter fence and causing the Prowlers to flee! Our goal for this area was to reduce the friction of rotating through the zone by removing the Prowlers, but also providing structures to build better fronts and defensive options when squads are forced into combat. REWORKED AREA: LIGHTNING ROD One of the biggest opportunities we wanted to address with this update was to solve for the low number of players choosing to drop on the high side of the map. In addition to adding ZEUS Station, the team felt that it was important to reduce the overall size of this zone to help make these POIs feel better connected to one another and the rest of Storm Point. And that’s just about everything! The team is looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the new Storm Point and playing with you all. See you in the ring! CROSS PROGRESSION With the launch of Season 19, we’re excited to roll out Cross Progression in a phased deployment across existing platforms in Apex Legends™. Keep an eye out for an in-game prompt to initiate the Cross Progression migration which will bring together your content and progression. For more information and platform restrictions, please check out our Cross Progression blog here: https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/cross-progression SKYDIVE HOLOSPRAYS Holosprays are soaring to new heights this season. Equip them to your wheel to use them while in-flight! Once deployed, Holosprays will follow your flight path for a limited time or until a Skydive Emote or different Holospray is used.

With it, the game is getting the usual spread of map reworks, a new Legend for players to mess around with, a battle pass with new cosmetics, etc. But it's also getting something special - a feature fans have been asking about for years now. Apex Legends is getting cross progression. As soon as the season starts, Apex Legends players with multiple accounts spread across PC and consoles will have their accounts merged into one master account. Your highest rank across your accounts will carry over, as will all your cosmetics which will be compiled into one neat collection. We're not quite sure yet how duplicate cosmetics will work, but fingers crossed that you get a nice amount of in-game currency. This is obviously great news for longtime players, especially those who may have a stray legendary skin lost on an old console (<a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-switch-trailer.\">or even the dreaded Apex Legends Switch version</a>) that they've been leaving to gather dust for a while now. Cross progression is one of those features that have been demanded by a subset of the community for a while now - almost as much as the push to make <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-everything-on-control\">certain limited time modes permanent</a>.

Yesterday, Respawn released a new episode of its Stories from the Outlands series titled \"For Us, Utang na Loob,\" which is all about the origin of Apex Legends' newest character Conduit, who also happens to be the game's first Filipino legend. As always, it's a nice little animated trailer giving us some insight into how Conduit found her way to the Apex Games. The trailer kicks off with quite a bleak look at Conduit's childhood, showing us that her hometown was under attack from a group of enemy titans. Thankfully, a Monarch titan comes to the rescue, letting her and her family live quite an idyllic life, and of course Conduit is quite the fan of the Apex Games. Unfortunately, her mother still seems to have a difficult workload, eventually netting herself a serious injury which leads them to some financial trouble. Lucky for Conduit, that same Monarch titan stayed in her town, though it has been cordoned off due to it leaking radiated energy. Obviously that doesn't stop her, and she goes to find the titan where she gets… some kind of power, it hasn't actually been revealed yet. In turn, she'll clearly be joining the Apex Games soon as part of the game's next season, <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/ignite\">Ignite</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-newest-character-reveal-will-put-those-titanfall-3-rumours-to-bed\">Read more</a> ",

For a limited-time, take out your enemies with a target-seeking grenade that looks almost as scary as the damage it does.

        "contents": "After years of being unplayable online, <strong>Titanfall 2</strong> has recently received an update that finally allows for multiplayer once again. For a long while now, the much loved but not massively successful first person shooter Titanfall 2 has been essentially impossible to play online. But, as shared in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/16fcaxp/vanilla_titanfall2_is_confirmed_playable_also/\">Titanfall subreddit</a>, the game has had an update that appears to have fixed the game's multiplayer servers. Up until recently, matchmaking was basically impossible, and server stability was often shaky at best. This recent update has fixed those issues though, alongside adding in new and old game modes, which have been rotated in and out since the update went live. A number of other issues have been changed too, like glitches, out-of-bounds exploits, as well as some changes to the map's geometry. Most notably, though, a number of Nessie plushies, Apex Legend's mascot, that are holding hammers have been spotted across the various parts of the maps that have been tweaked, as spotted by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16jf0bo/there_is_something_going_on_with_titanfall_2/\">another user on Reddit</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/titanfall-2-online-multiplayer-update\">Read more</a> ",

He spent almost 300 years under the Syndicate’s thumb with the help of Hammond, and all he wanted was to escape it. Suddenly, Revenant experiences a change—he starts to glitch. Everything is out of his control. In the middle of a match, he loses his abilities only to discover they've been replaced with new ones. Someone, somewhere, has launched a new protocol. He finds that he’s able to see enemies low on health, unleash a powerful leap forward, and forge a shroud of shadows around him that blocks incoming damage. But he also knows how to hold a grudge. Revenant’s angry, confused, and now he'll find and get revenge on whoever is messing with him. PASSIVE: Assassin’s Instinct Highlight nearby visible enemies who are low on health. You crouch walk faster and have improved wall climbing. TACTICAL: Shadow Pounce Unleash a powerful pounce forwards. Hold to charge for farther distances. ULTIMATE: Forged Shadows Forge a shroud of hardened shadows around you that blocks direct damage and regenerates after breaking. Your shadows and tactical are refreshed on knockdowns. Revenant will be unlocked for all players, all-season long. Players can complete challenges by using Revenant throughout the season in order to unlock him permanently. ",

Now, suddenly, he starts to glitch—someone has launched a new protocol. He finds that he’s able to see enemies low on health, unleash a powerful leap forward, and forge a shroud of shadows around him that blocks incoming damage. But he also knows how to hold a grudge.

Revenant has been rejuvenated with a new look, new abilities, and a new level of rage. Not unlocked? No problem. Play as Revenant all season long, and unlock him permanently by completing challenges. There’s something for everyone this season—from Broken Moon in Mixtape, a revamped Charge Rifle, updates to Ranked, new community Stickers from ryonello, and the new Death Dynasty Collection Event—and it all starts August 8, 2023. Stay tuned for our full list of updates in our Resurrection Patch Notes coming this Monday, August 7, 2023. LEGEND UPDATE: REVENANT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-revenant-heirloom.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg For years, Revenant has been mired in feelings of rage, self-hatred, and a lack of autonomy. He spent almost 300 years under the Syndicate’s thumb with the help of Hammond, and all he wanted was to escape it. Suddenly, Revenant experiences a change—he starts to glitch. Everything is out of his control. In the middle of a match, he loses his abilities only to discover they've been replaced with new ones. Someone, somewhere, has launched a new protocol. He finds that he’s able to see enemies low on health, unleash a powerful leap forward, and forge a shroud of shadows around him that blocks incoming damage. But he also knows how to hold a grudge. Revenant’s angry, confused, and now he'll find and get revenge on whoever is messing with him. PASSIVE: Assassin’s Instinct Highlight nearby visible enemies who are low on health. You crouch walk faster and have improved wall climbing. TACTICAL: Shadow Pounce Unleash a powerful pounce forwards. Hold to charge for farther distances. ULTIMATE: Forged Shadows Forge a shroud of hardened shadows around you that blocks direct damage and regenerates after breaking. Your shadows and tactical are refreshed on knockdowns. Revenant will be unlocked for all players, all-season long. Players can complete challenges by using Revenant throughout the season in order to unlock him permanently. CHARGE RIFLE UPDATE The Charge Rifle has been re-designed for immediate use in the Apex Games. No longer does the infamous weapon fire a sustained beam. Newly fitted with an Extended Sniper Mag attachment slot and boasting a number of changes to its firing mechanisms, Legends familiar with the anti-Titan model available during the Frontier Wars should feel right at home. Holding the trigger down will increase the weapon’s charge, while releasing the trigger will decrease it. Once fully charged, a powerful energy projectile is released which deals increased damage the further it travels. This projectile can pierce through multiple enemy Legends, so watch out which teammates you cozy up to! MIXTAPE: BROKEN MOON NEW TDM & GUN RUN MAP: THE CORE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-core.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg Broken Moon is coming to Mixtape! The Core provides a new and exciting battlefield for Gun Run and TDM. Occupying the central building gives great high ground and wide-open sightlines making it a prime location to fight over. Or take to the outer ring for prime access to Care Packages. The Core is a little bit bigger than what we’ve played previously. Zip rails help players rotate towards the action quickly and open sightlines promote a different style of gameplay and weapon meta than the other more personal, scrappier maps. NEW CONTROL MAP: PRODUCTION YARD https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-production-yard.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg It’s been a while since our last Control map and Broken Moon brings Production Yard to Control. Contrary to our other Broken Moon map for Mixtape, Production Yard provides an intense, scrappy experience in tight quarters. Lots of boxes and cover to duck around and tight corners to set-up defense or ambushes. Also featuring Broken Moon’s Zip rails, combat pace is really high on this map and allows players to quickly shift from attacking and defending at a moment's notice. We’re hoping players find a lot of different strategies in either bunkering up and covering angles or finding some sneaky back caps using zip rails and corners. RANKED UPDATE We’ve tightened up the matchmaking, tuned LP gains, and made eliminations a steady contributor to your rise through the ranks. Dive into the nitty-gritty of why Resurrection will see some of the sweatiest matches you’ve had this summer (or winter) in our recent Ranked Update blog. RANKED REWARD REWORK In previous seasons, players achieving Diamond+ ranks would get access to an exclusive season-long Dive Trail. We’ve been observing an unintended effect where the presence of a Ranked Dive Trail during the drop would unduly influence where players wanted to land—either strongly avoiding or actively pursuing players with the trail. A reward for being a top player shouldn’t give away valuable information at a critical part of the match, so we’ve made a change to swap the Dive Trail reward with an Epic Banner Frame as the Diamond+ Ranked reward. The Epic Banner Frame lets players flex their hard-earned status at the start of a match and more importantly, every time they take down other players. Badges, Holosprays and Weapon Cosmetics will continue to be rewarded in Ranked as in previous seasons. COMMUNITY STICKER BUNDLE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-community-sticker-bundle.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg You love seeing Apex Legends™ fan art and so does the team, so we had to have even more enter the game. From August 8-22, pick up our latest community sticker bundle featuring a plethora of stickers (and some special holographic ones) created by ryonello! “I had a lot of fun with it and got to explore sort of the more cheeky smug mischievous like unhinged side of the characters.” “My message to aspiring artists with the community is keep going, I love you. Draw what you love and other people will love it too. And I would really love to see your work as part of the collaborations one day.” Learn more about how stickers work in our FAQ here. DEATH DYNASTY COLLECTION EVENT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-collection-event.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg Death becomes you, Legends. Our first event of Resurrection will be launching with the season, and you’ll be handsomely rewarded with double XP in Battle Royale from August 8-15 and then in Mixtape from August 15-22. COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS Capture 24 limited-time cosmetics before they expire, with Legendary skins for Catalyst, Loba, and more!

All the cinematics we get of this infamous, terrifying murder-bot show him single-mindedly pursuing his targets, scuttling along walls, and wiping out enemies at close range like a cybernetic John Wick. But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his <a href=\"/apex-legends-revenant-abilities-tips-tricks\">Death Totem</a>, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character. Season 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities.

        "contents": "In the Arsenal Ranked update, the team rolled out a series of changes that were intended to create consistently competitive matches by adjusting the scoring system to focus on playing the Battle Royale and as a team. Now that players have had a solid amount of time playing the Arsenal update, we’ve been able to analyze the data behind-the-scenes. Today, we’re able to share our thoughts around the state—and immediate future of—Ranked Play. In an effort to address as many questions as possible, we’re hosting a live Ranked AMA on July 21, 2023 from 9:30-11:30 am Pacific Time. Join us on the r/ApexLegends subreddit! The art of game development is rarely a straight line, it often involves building upon and refining ideas—Ranked is no exception. We hit some aspects of our goals, and also missed the mark with some of our tuning and bugs, which caused the inflated number of players in Masters and occasional unfairness in matchmaking. Let's take a deeper look at these issues and discuss some upcoming changes that will help us move towards a more stable and competitive Ranked for future seasons. For those who just want the gist, here’s the TLDR: Overly Generous Ladder Points (LP): Arsenal’s LP tuning was intended to be generous, but not this generous. Its current tuning is causing a series of cascading issues with the rest of the Ranked system. We are tightening the amount of LP awarded and bonuses included for Season 18. Bugs: We love to hate them. They are contributing to the tuning problem and we’re feeling confident about our upcoming fixes. Future Changes: Season 18 will focus on refining Ranked tuning and stability. We’re going to take a deep breath and take the time needed to prepare for an even tighter and more competitive Ranked system. Thank you for your passion, your feedback, and for taking this journey with us. WHAT’S HAPPENED IN ARSENAL LADDER POINTS: PLACEMENT AND BONUS TUNING We intended Arsenal to be a learning experience for players adapting to the new ruleset and matchmaking. Unfortunately, the combo of this and some bugs in the Ranked system caused Ladder Point gains to be extremely generous, resulting in an excess of Masters players. Season 18 focus: lowering the amount of LP distributed in a match to even out the distribution of players per rank. BONUSES When a player’s ranking vastly exceeds their Matchmaking Rating (MMR) equivalent, the bonus system withholds the bonus. This limit is intended and used to dial in the correct rank over time. Thanks to the aforementioned generous LP, some players’ rankings were inflated compared to their MMR causing them to hit this “no bonus” state much sooner. In extreme cases, the rank was ~1-2 tiers higher than the MMR which caused the bonus withholding system to completely overshadow all bonuses. With future adjustments, this state will return to being hard to reach. For the average player not seeing bonuses, they’d need to raise their MMR by actively defeating multiple squads per match while placing high in order to start getting bonuses again. But we know that it feels bad to perform well and not see any bonuses. Season 18 focus: adding a minimum elimination bonus increase based on the player's MMR that will be exempt from bonus withholding and bumping up the elim bonus slightly. RANK DISTRIBUTION Let’s get right to it: you may have even seen a graph like the one below. This inflation of Masters players is caused by a mix of bugs and the overly generous LP tuning. LP distribution skewed further to the right than we would like, resulting in too many Masters players. The distribution is indicated in the below graph with the dotted line for players from Rookie 4 through to 36000 LP. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/2023-07-13-ranked-dev-blog-percent-player-per-lp.png.adapt.1920w.png Our next steps: LP gains per match will be decreased to address the shift in the ranking distribution. Adding a ruleset that only applies to Diamond + to address the large concentration of players creeping above. Players in these ranked tiers will have increased stakes and LP losses, and decreased rating bonuses and loss mitigations. These solutions together will slow the pace to Masters for the average player, and allow for more accurate matchmaking and higher quality matches—especially at Diamond+ ranks. PLAYING THE BATTLE ROYALE END GAME With the Arsenal updates, we’re seeing more climactic end games with multiple squads, players valuing their lives, and wanting to win the game instead of deathmatch simulators. An intense firefight for the top placement in an exciting, hectic endgame is the most memorable way to close a game of Apex Legends™, and we’re happy this is happening more frequently. The chart below is just one of the metrics that we use to detect potential intensity of play at various points during a match. Even 2 additional players alive at the 15-minute mark is impactful for the average match! https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/2023-07-13-ranked-dev-blog-surviving-player-count-at-15-minutes.png.adapt.1920w.png PERCEPTIVE PLAY Perceptive Play is more macro focused, where play is centered around ring positioning rather than all out aggression—an extreme variant of this is often referred to as \"ratting\". While exciting endgames are happening, there is room for improvement with the recent increase of ratting. A portion of this is due to an increased number of players waiting for ring closures, but we can safely say that it is mostly due to players hiding and avoiding others (while crouching or standing). https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/2023-07-13-ranked-dev-blog-time-spent-idle-during-match.png.adapt.1920w.png Pretty sure you’re not all doing squat reps between rings… We’ve noticed a particular pattern in both Ranked and ALGS levels: teams stay outside of the ring and delay interacting with other teams to gain points. Hiding and avoiding firefights isn’t a rewarding way to play Apex Legends™. Season 18 has some updates to target this, and more are coming in future seasons to address the core gameplay issues around inactivity and avoidant playstyles. Season 18 focuses: Adjusting ring timings to increase mid-game encounters Ring damage tuning to enforce playing inside the ring Fixed a number of \"ratting\" spots with more fixes to come MATCHMAKING GENEROUS LP’S EFFECT ON MATCHMAKING We need to talk about a specific detail with the Arsenal matchmaker that wasn’t in our previous ranked blog. While we generally matchmake based on MMR, we start using Ranking (LP) in place of a player’s MMR when their ranking exceeds their MMR equivalent. In an extreme example, if a Gold MMR player has a LP ranking of Diamond, this player will be matched into a Diamond lobby. This is to ensure MMR and LP ranking are connected and can both help guide players to their accurate Rank. If players succeed in these more difficult matchmaking situations, we allow them to continue climbing. Unfortunately, too many players in a game have inflated LP because of the generous tuning. This effectively creates a game full of players with lower MMR than their current Rank, nullifying the effect of this mechanic. In Arsenal, you’ve been matching with a wider range of skill of players, even at the highest Ranks. This wasn’t intended and meant that your match-over-match experience varied much more than desired. We believe this will be less of an issue with reduced LP distribution in Season 18. Season 18 focus: updating matchmaking to better handle players that are actively challenging their MMR to ensure a competitively challenging match that mirrors their current ranking. MATCH QUALITY The new matchmaking algorithm is producing more competitive matches overall and matchmaking gameplay metrics are up across the board. As an example, let’s look at one gameplay metric: Total Damage per Match. We use this to have an understanding of match intensity. When a match is unfair, many squads are decimated by an outlier squad, thus denying many players opportunities to deal damage. In contrast, a more fair match will have squads fighting, taking cover, and recovering, resulting in more overall damage dealt in a game. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/2023-07-13-ranked-dev-blog-total-damage-per-match.png.adapt.1920w.png QUEUE TIME We believe queue times are too short, contributing to a higher chance you’re matched outside of your MMR. The graph below shows average wait time by player skill (lower skill on the left of the x-axis, higher on the right). https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/2023-07-13-ranked-dev-blog-queue-time-by-skill-bracket.png.adapt.1920w.png During matchmaking, the system is trying to find players of a similar MMR—the longer it searches, the closer the match. The intent is to find similarly skilled players for maximum excitement and challenge, but it’s a race against the clock. Waiting forever isn’t fun either.When there aren’t enough exact matches to your MMR, the matchmaking system will continue to search for a limited time before starting the match with the closest MMR players it can find. Matchmaking is failing at the extreme end of very high skill. These players are getting into matches too quickly, creating unfair matches with a too wide MMR range—mercilessly eliminating the lobby. We’re working on improving matchmaking for that end of the ladder to combat this. Season 18 focus: the elusive root cause of this bug has been identified and we’re actively working on a fix for more consistent, high-end match experiences. The rest of the population is very stable and are more consistently matching with close MMR values. The graph below shows the adjusted MMR width of a game, highlighting how close MMR is in matches based on your current MMR + LP. Overall, the value is consistent across all but the highest tier of play. This is great because it means the matchmaker is working consistently and delivering consistently competitive matches for most players. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/2023-07-13-ranked-dev-blog-match-width-by-skill.png.adapt.1920w.png Even though it’s consistent, the width above (~1.5 tiers) is still bigger than we’d like and we are confident we can tighten matches to divisions (instead of tiers) within a reasonable queue time. Season 18 focus: continued improvements and updates to matchmaking as a whole. These will ship as they are ready and are not locked to patch cycles. SEASON 18 AND BEYOND The team has been hard at work digging into Arsenal’s data, working to address known bugs, and refining the Ranked system further. If you’ve made it this far, thanks for your time. Here’s a quick recap: Decreasing overall LP gains per match to combat the overall shift in the rank distribution. Adding a ruleset that only applies to Diamond+ to properly dial in the top of the ladder. Players in these ranked tiers will have increased stakes and losses, and decreased rating bonuses and loss mitigations. Be ready to put it all on the line. Adding a minimum elimination bonus increase based on the player's MMR and buffing elimination bonus in general. Eliminations should always be a contributor to your rank. Increasing action in the ring by adjusting ring damage. Adjusting ring timings to create more mid-game encounters and less pre-finale lulls. Updating matchmaking to better handle players that are actively challenging their MMR, for more competitively challenging matches that mirror their ranking. Waiting until Season 18 for these updates gives us more data to further inform these changes and strengthen our tuning, but it also gives players who made it to their first Masters time to relish the moment. If you earned Masters in Arsenal, you’ll keep it. You played by the game rules we implemented, and hopefully Season 18 will challenge you to earn it again. We want to deliver the best Ranked BR experience in the world, with the tightest matchmaking and the sweatiest competition at every rank tier. Splits will not be returning for now as we’re focusing on monitoring and further finetuning. We look forward to sharing more updates on Ranked and how we plan to achieve our goals, especially as we approach Season 19—which is already in motion! You play the most important role in the success of Apex Legends™, so please keep sharing your thoughts, feelings, and battle stories. And don’t forget to join us on r/ApexLegends subreddit for a live Ranked AMA on July 21, 2023 from 9:30AM - 11:30AM Pacific Time.",

The copy of this article has been updated to reflect that. If you think an <strong>Apex Legends Revenant rework</strong> is due, you're in luck.

Here, sibling fighters Sok Leng and Kit Siang Phua reigned supreme. They were joined by August Brinkman, Sok Leng’s eventual husband. But when August’s selfish playstyle led to Kit Siang’s death, August would retreat from the Games, from Sok Leng, and from their young son, Nate. August spent decades as a recluse. When Nate decides to follow his family’s legacy into the arena, August returns to strike a deal to reenter the Games in his son’s place. PASSIVE: SLING Store a third weapon in the sling. Access via inventory or Character Utility Action Button. The sling weapon cannot take attachments. TACTICAL: WHISTLER Shoots a projectile that heats up an enemy's gun as they shoot.

As we look to make Apex Legends more approachable for new players, this system incentivizes learning about the strengths and character of all our weapons. The goal is to deepen player engagement across the board regardless of who you main or which mode you prefer. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/arsenal-patch-notes/apex-legends-arsenal-patch-notes-asset-03.png.adapt.1920w.png At the season launch, all players will start with every weapon at level 1 and can start progressing their weapon levels by using them in any game mode. Having a weapon in hand, dealing damage, securing kills, and fighting with style will all generate Weapon XP for that weapon. Every 20 levels, a weapon-specific trial will unlock for you to test your skill with that weapon and reward you for completion. Get your weapon to level 100 and finish all five trials to fully “master” that weapon and earn the final rewards. Each weapon mastery track will earn players weapon-specific badges, lifetime performance trackers, legendary weapon mastery banner frames, and a Legendary Weapon Apex Pack for each weapon. FIRING RANGE UPDATES https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/arsenal-patch-notes/apex-legends-arsenal-patch-notes-asset-04.png.adapt.1920w.png Read the full breakdown of all the updates coming to Firing Range in our full blog here: https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/arsenal-season-game-updates NEW SURVIVAL SLOT ITEM: EVAC TOWER The Evac Tower is the latest loot item to hit the Outlands. This portable Jump Tower can shape the battlefield in your squad's favor by offering a quick escape or setting up a deadly assault. Harness the power of the skies, but be careful when you use it - players can destroy the Evac Tower and leave you high and dry! PING SYSTEM UPDATES Pings are the main method of non-verbal communication in Apex Legends, and coordination is the key to victory! This season, we’ve updated the system to better serve the game as it exists today. We’ve removed some Pings from the default Ping Wheel with lower usage rates, added several new pings, and added quality of life improvements to how pinging operates in game. Our goal is to give all players, especially those not using voice chat, access to some quick combat ‘phrases’ to help orient team action. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/arsenal-patch-notes/apex-legends-arsenal-patch-notes-asset-05.png.adapt.1920w.png On the default Ping Wheel you will see 3 new pings: Avoid Area Enemy Audio Regroup You will also see an expanded set of options when you are Downed or in Dropship for the initial drop into the BR. Lastly, we’ve improved Pinging from the Map behaviors in the following ways: In-game objects that have map icons (Respawn Beacons, Crafters, Wildlife, etc) can now be Pinged from the map; creating accurate waypoints with callouts When pinging generic waypoints on the map they will have more accurate placement in World Space https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/arsenal-patch-notes ",

        "contents": "A brand new <strong>Apex Legends update</strong> is on the way, with Season 17: Arsenal set to launch soon. Of course, this also entails a whole host of chops and changes, and developer Respawn has certainly been busy tweaking away at the popular battle royale game. Among the patch notes are a slew of balance changes, as well as the shifting of one elusive Legend into the Support Class. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/arsenal-patch-notes\">official change list</a>, when the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 17 release date</a> rolls around, Mirage will leave a decoy in the Skirmisher section, skedaddling over to join Gibraltar, Lifeline, Loba, and Newcastle in the Supports. While <a href=\"/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> fans had perhaps hoped that an entirely new Legend would begin to even out the number disparity between certain classes in one of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-battle-royale-game\">best battle royale games</a>, this is certainly an alternative. But that's not the only change coming to the Support Class. As per the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes</a>, Support Bin secret compartments will now guarantee a Shield Battery, and will award Mobile Respawn Beacons for dead allies, even if you don't have their banner card. Additionally, Support Class players will no longer be the designated Legend Banner crafter, with any player in their team now being granted the ability to do so as long as a Support Legend constitutes part of their team composition. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/update-season-17-support-class-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-leaks-ticks-titanfall-2\">Apex Legends leaks suggest Titanfall 2 ticks will invade battle royale</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-18-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 18 release date speculation, gameplay, more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks, Season 16 ranked split, RP changes, and more</a> ",

However, there's one strange pitfall with this <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> character's ultimate ability that could catch players out: triggering Tempest will force you to use your stowed third weapon. As detailed in <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/about/characters/ballistic\">Apex Legends' official Ballistic character page</a> ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 17 release date</a>, Tempest (his ultimate ability) will provide his teammates with faster reloads, faster unarmed move speed, and infinte ammo - for the duration of the ability, of course. However, it also confirms that \"Ballistic's sling weapon will be equipped and upgraded to gold\" - something not made clear in the recent trailer showcasing Ballistic's abilities. Why might this be a problem? Well, Sling (his passive ability) will not allow players to equip any attachments on this additional weapon. So, while this weapon could help you out in a pinch, it's not going to be where you keep your favourite weapon throughout a battle royale match. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ballistic-passive-ability-tempest-weapon\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ballistic-abilities\">All Apex Legends Ballistic abilities</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-esports-skins-ea-respawn-shut-down\">Here's why we never got those leaked Apex Legends ALGS esports skins</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-weapon-mastery-time\">Don't expect to rush through Apex Legends' new Weapon Mastery system</a> ",

From what we know, it sounds like discussions between EA, Respawn Entertainment, and the organisations were shut down just weeks before the ALGS esports skins were due to be available in <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>. Delving into why Apex Legends' ALGS esports organisation-based skins, which you can see in this September 2022 leak from '<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HYPERMYSTx/status/1573373375094951939\">Hypermyst</a>' here, never made it to the item shop, <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/inside-the-breakdown-of-eas-revenue-share-deal-for-apex-legends-esports/\">Digiday</a> journalist Billy Studholme was able to uncover that \"EA shut down talks of esports revenue-sharing from in-game item sales\" in September 2022, \"according to email correspondence to executives at two of the esports that were involved with talks with EA\".<em> </em> Despite the skins themselves seemingly ready to go, as the leaks suggest, Studholme's findings seem to suggest that their apparent disappearance is the result of EA and Respawn Entertainment's refusal to meet the ALGS esports organisation's terms when it came to revenue-sharing - something that provides a vital source of income for organisations. And, since this deal fell apart, a number of the ALGS' top organisations have \"left the esports title for good\". <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-esports-skins-ea-respawn-shut-down\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ballistic-abilities\">All Apex Legends Ballistic abilities</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ballistic-passive-ability-tempest-weapon\">Apex Legends' Ballistic ultimate isn't all it's cracked up to be</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-weapon-mastery-time\">Don't expect to rush through Apex Legends' new Weapon Mastery system</a> ",

        "contents": "With a fantastic fourth anniversary in the books, we're bringing an Arsenal of updates this season. Fear of Fragment? We've got some rejuvenations for World's Edge that are sure to improve drops of all spice levels. But wait, there's more including the debut of Weapon Mastery, robust updates to the Firing Range, the debut of the Evac Tower, and more! WORLD'S EDGE MAP UPDATE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/a00e5031860da54fec6eed2a8847bf1eb3b70543.png With this update we aim to improve the overall Battle Royale experience and bring a healthy set of changes to World’s Edge in Arsenal. Starting off with our new Point of Interest, Monument. NEW POI: MONUMENT One of the hottest topics for World’s Edge is Fragment East and West. This season we have decided to make some changes starting with our new POI, Monument. We know Fragment is a polarizing spot on the map, and we also like it to boot. Our goal was to be delicate and add something fresh to the long-standing map center. Fictionally, Monument stands as a testament to the Apex Games. Its museum celebrates Apex’s past, present, and future. It’s a shining beacon to us on the dev team. A glowing reminder for how far Apex Legends has come since its initial debut in 2019. The Monument Project has been brought to you by Silva Pharmaceuticals—paving the way to a brighter future at the Edge of the World. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image1.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.jpg https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image13.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.jpg From a design standpoint, Monument is a deep bunker with a quick access sniper nest for positional control and scouting. The glass ceiling brings an interesting component to the vertically layered fights this space offers. It’s a different pace to the familiar collapsed map center and we hope you enjoy it. That being said, we did make one more big change to Fragment…. NEW POI: STACKS In our efforts to balance the map’s landing distributions, the tower of the sweat lords had to go. You know the one, built like a stack of pancakes with two ziplines on either end: Fragment’s infamous Construction Stack. Don’t worry, it’s not gone; we just moved it. Now introducing - Stacks! Our new Point of Interest on the southern edge. Built like a red velvet layer cake, Stacks is a crow’s nest that’s all about verticality with its interconnected rooftops replacing the long-forgotten Lava City. Positioned right next to Rampart’s Big Maude, we plan for the counter play here to be high. Did someone say cat and mouse? LAVA UPDRAFT IS NO MORE In this Season, we have completely removed the “vertical updraft” movement system from World’s Edge. This floaty state above deep Lava Fissures was a remnant of World’s Edge that is no longer needed with our recent map adjustments. To compensate, we have raised the lava floor and it is now walkable. Be careful, it’s hot. HARVESTER UPDATE After removing the lava updraft, it was logical to improve the landing experience at Harvester. Threading the needle through the building’s central tube will now bring players to a safe landing platform. “Safe” but also surrounded by lava. This loot honey pot also provides a new shortcut. You can now catch a zipline across Harvester’s circular arena from below, adding a new approach to fights here. We’ve also created a new vertical connection. An open window that allows players to jump from Harvester’s center room to the platform below. It’s a risky escape route for when your squad is being pinched by predators. NEW VAULT NEAR SKYHOOK We’ve added an additional Vault for balanced Vault distribution. This North vault is nestled in a tunnel leading to Skyhook. Vault key drops have been increased; Vault loot has been relaxed. Loba mains rejoice. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image5.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.jpg SNOW IN SKYHOOK Hammond’s Climatizer technology has made advances cooling the region down. Additional Climate Seeding Towers have been installed near Skyhook to further their efforts. As a result, Skyhook has received a fresh dusting of snow, opening new pathways and injecting some new life to the area. MIRAGE A TROIS This Party POI has left the previous Season’s maps and has now settled in World’s Edge. WEAPON MASTERY Weapon Mastery is our first new long-term progression system outside of account level! As we look to make Apex Legends more approachable for new players, this system incentivizes them to learn about the strengths and character of all our weapons. The goal here was to deepen player engagement across the board regardless of who you main or which mode you prefer. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image18.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.jpg When the feature launches, all players will start with every weapon at level 1 and can start progressing their weapon levels by using them in any game mode. These levels are account wide and do not reset with seasons. Having a weapon in hand, dealing damage, securing kills, and fighting with style will all generate Weapon XP for that weapon. Every 20 levels, a weapon specific trial will unlock for you to test your skill with that weapon and reward you for completion. Get your weapon to level 100 and finish all five trials to fully “master” that weapon and earn the final rewards. Each weapon mastery track will earn players weapon-specific badges, lifetime performance trackers, Legendary weapon mastery banner frames, and a guaranteed Legendary skin for each weapon. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image21.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image9.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.jpg FIRING RANGE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image19.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg This season, we are debuting an all-new Firing Range, re-design from the ground up as your ultimate evolving training platform. Learn, experiment, practice, improve! Familiarize yourself with Apex Legends Warm up before matches Sharpen your shooting and movement skills Experiment with weapons, attachments and gear Develop and hone tactics with your squadmates Practice combat in duels with friends, and against combat dummies that shoot However you'd like to sharpen your skills, the ever-expanding tools and features will have you covered! COMPLETELY OVERHAULED LAYOUT The Firing Range has been completely re-designed with one core idea in mind: flow. We have expanded the space to give you more room to play. From a reorganized Core to a new Agility Course, Duel Pit, and POI sized town, this new space is built from the ground up for skill expression and skill development. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image11.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Core: a reorganized Weapons & Loot layout allows players to find what they’re looking for quickly and efficiently. Simulated death boxes allow you to grab your favorite loot from anywhere in the Range. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image3.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Agility Course: designed for mobility. Slide, zip, jump, climb, and balance to harden your movement skills. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image20.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Duel Pit: designed for you to duke it out with friends and finally settle the debate on who has the fastest Wingman in the Outlands. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image14.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Training Grounds: the rear town allows you to practice fighting in a simulated combat experience. Customizable Dummies Dummies can be configured to spawn, move, and shoot at players in a variety of ways. Change the settings to find the experience that best serves your needs. Turn on Full Combat mode to have the Dummies come to life and aggressively attack you all over the Firing Range! Improved Targets Infinitely shootable targets will light up different colors to give you feedback for where you hit them. Turn on Hit Markers in the Customize Range settings to learn shot patterns for the myriad of available weapons. Improved Dynamic Stats Dynamic Stats that track your performance in real time can now be manually reset so you can use it in any manner you wish. NEW SURVIVAL ITEM: EVAC TOWER Evac Towers provide a new means for Legends to traverse the dangerous Apex Games and gain a positional advantage over their adversaries. Expect to find this new survival item on the floor, inside loot bins, and in care packages. Deploying an Evac Tower will send a rocket skyward, eventually exploding into a balloon high above the action. Once the anchor brings the zipline to ground level, Legends will be able to ride up and initiate a skydive, redeploying to a new location. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image17.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.jpg https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/arsenal-season-game-updates/image6.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.jpg Be careful though – the Evac Tower has a limited duration and will slowly take damage over time. Enemies and allies can also shoot the balloon to accelerate this process, destroying both the Evac Tower and your hopes of escaping. Pay attention to where you deploy because your evac may be hotter than anticipated! SEE YOU ON THE DROPSHIP We’re excited to see how these World’s Edge updates switch up your hot drops and battles, and may the new Firing Range help hone your skills and guide you to victory.

However, you shouldn't expect to rush through this new progression system - even if you play <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> all the time. Why? Well, you might need weeks of game-time to unlock everything on offer. As reported by media outlet <a href=\"https://www.dexerto.com/apex-legends/apex-legends-weapon-mastery-system-explained-rewards-trials-and-more-2124813/\">Dexerto</a>, it looks like it could take Apex Legends players anywhere between 80 hours and 120 hours to complete each set of Weapon Mastery challenges. With it looking like the \"trials\" you'll be met with being \"very skill dependent\", it could take even longer than that. Apex Legends' upcoming Weapon Mastery system is the battle royale's \"first new long-term progresion system\" and aims to \"make Apex Legends more approachable for new players\" - according to this <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/arsenal-season-game-updates\">Apex Legends blog post</a> detailing the new features coming to the battle royale in Season 17. When you consider the fact that Respawn Entertainment has explained that \"the goal here was to deepen player engagement across the board\", it's certainly understandable that the Weapon Mastery system would offer several hours-worth of content. However, we can't help but feel as though it's a little too long - if what Dexerto says is true, anyway.

One of the most interesting changes to come from Respawn's refresher of Ranked is the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>' Ranked mode will be presenting players with an invisible MMR system going forwards - while also dropping Ranked Points (RP) for Ladder Points (LP) - that could result in longer queue times. Oh, joy. As explained online, Apex Legends wants to provide its' players with \"consistently competitive matches\" moving forwards. So, it's \"enabling matchmaking in Ranked based on a hidden Matchmaking Rating (MMR)\". With RP not being a true representation of a player's skill level, Respawn Entertainment is hoping to introduce a hidden MMR system that values match fairness - but, that could also result in \"a small, but noticeable increase in queue times\". However, this is also going to account for party size and should offer Respawn a more accurate assessment of your skill level when matchmaking. This divorce from RP, though, does mean that there's a new points system to contend with: Ladder Points. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-ranked-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-weapon-mastery-time\">Don't expect to rush through Apex Legends' new Weapon Mastery system</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 17 release date, new Legend, more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/match-replay-third-party-tool-pubg\">Apex Legends' battle royale fanatics deserve access to this PUBG tool</a> ",

We know this is a new source, so it should be taken with one or two rather large pinches of salt, but changes to Apex Legends' Ranked Splits is something fans have been calling for and it actually makes quite a lot of sense when you think about the Ranked changes Apex Legends has made prio - in Season 16. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/leaks-season-17-ranked-splits\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-teasers-firing-range\">Apex Legends' Firing Range is in for an upgrade with Season 17</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks, Season 16 ranked split, RP changes, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 17 release date, new Legend, more</a> ",

If that isn't Apex Games' heritage, we don't know what is. However, it also explains why he's back in the fictional battle royale <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> depicts - and it's quite an interesting reason. In the Stories From The Outlands short, which was preceeded on YouTube by an infomercial for a drug that uses Prowler Blood to seemingly fight muscle decay, Respawn Entertainment offered Apex Legends fans a quick background into August \"Ballistic\" Brinkman and where he is nowadays. Interestingly, the leaks weren't completely wrong - Ballistic's son had just qualified for the Apex Games. However, Ballistic is shown to make a deal with Eduardo Silva to keep his son from actually participating - offering himself instead. This isn't a deal done lightly, either. As you can see for yourself, Ballistic lives up to his name and makes it very clear to Silva that this isn't a deal he should refuse. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ballistic-lore-stories-from-the-outlands\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-teasers-firing-range\">Apex Legends' Firing Range is in for an upgrade with Season 17</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks, Season 16 ranked split, RP changes, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 17 release date, new Legend, more</a> ",

In a recently-released animated short featuring Rampart and a \"last minute customer\", eagle-eyed <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> fans have spotted a small detail that seems to suggest the newest face on the roster might not be actually using their father's moniker after all - despite the leaks. If you're wondering what we're talking about, allow us to explain. For a fair few weeks now, it has been rumoured that the next Legend joining the Apex Games would be Ballistic. However, this <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/datamine-ballistic-voice-lines-blisk\">Apex Legends datamine teased a rather interesting detail about the leaked Ballistic</a> - that the character we're going to see introduced in Season 17 is actually the son of the revered combatant. So, this has led to a loose general consensus that the Ballistic we see in-game has - we suppose - inherited their father's name for their appearance in this deadly competition. However, and a big \"however\" at that, Apex Legends fans have spotted the name Caliber in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1646207994835898369\">recently-released animated short</a> - on a sticky note, no less.

When something is introduced that's a little broken, though, it changes the experience. A recent example of this is the Splash Zone Flatline weapon skin; this AR cosmetic was updated to fix it's iron sights, which were allegedly \"smaller than it should be\". If you're not sure why smaller iron sights are an issue, they improve visibility and target acquisition - offering whoever's using it an unfair advantage. However, it's looking like Apex Legends' Splash Zone Flatline skin was always destined to be busted. Now, we know that's a big claim, but there's evidence - of which was shared on the Apex Legends Uncovered subreddit by '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/12b0icn/the_concept_art_of_flatline_beach_skin_has_clear/\">RaizTheOne</a>'.

And, when there isn't a new Apex Legends leak to talk about, there's a new theory about this battle royale's future to discuss - you know, to fill the time. Of course, a lot of this is interesting conversation. However, quite a lot of it can be bogus - to put it politely. Thankfully, though, we have some hard evidence to talk about and it's quite a bit more exciting than finding out that Octane is getting another legendary skin in the next Collection Event (as an example). A new batch of data mined Apex Legends voice lines are teasing some interesting information about Ballistic - a future participant of the Apex Games and quite possibly this battle royale's next new character. As you may already know, if you're someone who keeps on top of the latest Apex Legends leaks, there has been quite a bit of discussion over the last few months of whether this mysterious Ballistic character is Kuben Blisk - the founder of the Apex Games and . The characters do share some resemblence, looking at what limited information we have about them both, and they're both rumoured to be Assault legends. However, beyond that, there hasn't been anything to say that they're not entirely different people - even if we all know that a character's abilities are always subject to change prior to release. Well, that is, until now. As you'll be able to see below, this new Apex Legends voice lines leak seem to suggest that Ballistic is the child of a revered and famous figure in the Apex Legends universe. And, of course, we think that this figure is Kuben Blisk himself. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/datamine-ballistic-voice-lines-blisk\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 17 release date - when does it start?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-17-teaser-rumble-ltm-leak\">Apex Legends' Season 17 teasers double down on Rumble LTM leaks</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list - the top picks for Season 16</a> ",

Guns out in the Sun Squad Collection event featuring a brand new limited-time mode that turns up the heat on Battle Royale, 24 limited-time cosmetics including Legendary skins for Fuse, Mirage, and more, and the debut of Ash’s “Strongest Link” Heirloom. NEW LIMITED-TIME MODE: HEATWAVE HEATWAVE is a new limited-time mode that turns up the heat on the Apex Games. All the usual rules of Trio’s apply, but you’ll want to look out for Heatwaves that periodically happen throughout the match. When the heats on, you’ll need to avoid taking damage from the sun by taking cover indoors or under objects. If you’re caught out in the open, only sliding cools you down if you want to avoid Heatwave damage on the move. Lastly, Heatshields have increased in size and protect you in a large area from the sun for those moments when you’re caught outdoors and need to beat the heat quickly. Take care when using Heatshields though, they will be destroyed quickly when deployed outside the Ring. Keep an eye out for Care Packages. Perhaps there lies another way to mitigate the effects of the sun and look cool while doing it. But you’ll need to jump into the mode on March 28th to find out more. SUN SQUAD COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS Unlock 24 explosive limited-time cosmetics, with Legendary skins for Ash, Mirage, Fuse, and more! All 24 items will be available in exchange for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals and in Sun Squad Collection Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you unlock them all before the event ends, you’ll automatically receive Ash’s “Strongest Link” Heirloom! REWARD TRACKER You can earn up to 1,600 points per day and challenges refresh daily.

However, as exciting as the new Apex Legends event skins are, the upcoming Sun Squad Collection Event is missing a few skins. Thankfully, a talented 3D artist has taken it upon themselves to deliver Sun Squad Collection Event swimsuit skins for Revenant and Pathfinder. Yeah, they're just about as hilarious as you might imagine they are. Taking to the Apex Legends subreddit with the confidence of a 3D artist who has struck gold, '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/11zldjy/couldnt_wait_for_the_new_swimsuit_skins_so_i_made/\">Muradiant</a>' has shared an image of both Revenant and Pathfinder wearing bikinis on a beach. We don't want to call anyone out for being a fool, but if you think wearing a bikini is going to make Revenant look less cool, you're mistaken. He's obviously wearing sunnies. But, as you can see for yourself below, these swimsuit skins are quite-literally just the default appearances for both of Apex Legends characters mentioned with solid-colour bikinis on. As hilarious as we find it, we're not sure Respawn Entertainment would get away with a skin that's so similar to the default appearance - even if that's what the fans seemingly want. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/swimsuit-skin-fan-art-revenant-pathfinder\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/sun-squad-collection-event-start-time\">Apex Legends' Sun Squad Collection Event start time nears for FPS fans</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ash-buff-sun-squad-collection-event\">Apex Legends smuggles vital Ash buff in Sun Squad event update</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/swimsuit-skin-tease-sun-squad-collection-event\">You can stop asking now, an Apex Legends swimsuit skin is coming</a> ",

Say hello to Mixtape: a permanent playlist featuring a rotation of Team Deathmatch, Control, and Gun Run! It’s the perfect way to take a break from Battle Royale and hone your skills in new ways. We're also excited to be adding the Mixtapes modes to Custom Matches on March 7th! We'll also be adjusting the requirements to start a match based on the modes available. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/imperial-collection-event/imperial.png.adapt.1456w.png Players needed to start Battle Royale Mode: 30 Players needed to start Team Deathmatch mode: 12 Players needed to start Control Mode: 6 Players needed to start Gun Run: 6 IMPERIAL GUARD COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS Unlock 24 enchanting limited-time cosmetics, with Legendary skins for Wraith, Gibraltar, Loba, and more! https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/imperial-collection-event/imperial-guard-ce-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg All 24 items will be available in exchange for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals and in Imperial Guard Collection Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. For this collection, we’re keeping our anniversary festivities going by changing the crafting cost of items in this event! All Crafting Metal prices for event items will be reduced by 50% (e.g. Legendaries that would have cost 2,400 will be reduced to 1,200). You will be able to craft all the items in the Collection Event for half the cost of Crafting Metals. This means players can unlock Wraith’s Hope’s Dawn Kunai for half the cost compared to other Collection Events. We will also be adding 2 Collection Event packs and 3 regular Apex Packs to the reward tracker, allowing players to unlock Hope’s Dawn even sooner! You can still earn up to 1,400 points per day and challenges refresh daily. All these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass so you can complete multiple challenges at once. As a refresher, here is the breakdown of Collection Event packs contents: https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/imperial-collection-event/image2.png.adapt.1456w.png If you unlock all 24 Collection Event items before the event ends, you’ll automatically receive Wraith’s “Hope’s Dawn” Heirloom! HOPE’S DAWN Apex Legends is ever-changing. With the recent fourth anniversary of Apex Legends, we brought some major shake-ups to the game. We are continuing our philosophy of taking learnings from the last four years to ensure the game continually feels fresh and new for players across all aspects of the game. Wraith’s Kunai was first added to the game in 2019 with the introduction of Heirlooms. Since then, we have expanded what Heirlooms look and feel like in the game. To bring Wraith’s Heirloom up to a place that’s more in line with our recent Heirloom releases, we’re revitalizing her Kunai and introducing Wraith’s new “Hope’s Dawn” Heirloom! Celebrate the 4th Anniversary with this new version of Wraith’s Kunai Heirloom. Hope’s Dawn comes with a host of new details and changes for our Wraith mains—both old and new. Acquiring the new Hope’s Dawn Kunai set will give you access to new animations, VFX, color variations, a new Mythic emote, and a Mythic Banner. Slay in style as you hot drop into our anniversary season! For those who unlock Hope’s Dawn and already own Wraith’s OG Heirloom, you’ll have the option to equip either of them in your menu. Players with the original Kunai will also automatically get the new animations and VFX made for the release of Hope’s Dawn. Some eagle-eyed Wraith mains might have already noticed we began rolling out the new animations and VFX with the launch of Revelry! During the Imperial Guard Collection Event, players will unlock the Hope’s Dawn Kunai by finishing the Collection Event. After the event ends, players can choose to spend their Heirloom shards on the original Kunai Heirloom or the Hope’s Dawn Kunai via the Mythics store tab in-game.

Despite the fact that this <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/imperial-guard-collection-event\">Apex Legends blog post</a> only confirms the start date of this event, <strong>the Apex Legends Imperial Guard Collection Event start time is 10:00 PST / 13:00 EST / 18:00 GMT on March 7</strong>. This information is based on the start time of previous in-game events; Respawn Entertainment has a schedule and it likes to stick to it.

The ping system felt revolutionary for a battle royale game when Apex Legends launched and it without a doubt helped players organise and share relevant in-game information without voice chat. However, there's a level of complexity to Apex Legends that a ping system can't convey and we think there's a feature that could help new players jumping into Apex Legends' ranked mode (and those of you solo-queueing) stay on top of communicating this information without the need for voice chat - or text chat, if you're a console player. If you're sitting there wondering what this feature could be, this Reddit post from Apex Legends player '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/11ixbug/respawn_please_consider_putting_some_sort_of/\">Shocker_103</a>' offers up a very good example of it - although, we don't really have a name for it. What we think Apex Legends needs is contextual tips - something akin to the Smart Loot system employed in the battle royale, but with suggestions relating to resource allocation and taking advantage of the unique abilities each legend has. As you will be able to see below, an example of a pop-up that suggests a player with a high-rarity Knockdown Shield gives that to the Newcastle player in their squad to \"increase the chance of a successful revival\" is the sort of thing we're talking about. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/smart-tips-feature-ranked\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/mixtape-playlist-ranked-practice\">Apex Legends' new playlist the perfect place to warm up for ranked</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/imperial-guard-collection-event-start-time\">Apex Legends' Imperial Guard Collection Event start time is hours away</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-catalyst-pick-rate-imperialhal\">Apex Legends pick rates trend might mean new meta on horizon for FPS</a> ",

Well, while the most popular legends aren't changing just yet, Apex Legends' defensive conjurer Catalyst has seen a relative boom in popularity at this battle royale's higher ranks. As shown by <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/game-stats/legends-pick-rates/Diamond\">Apex Legends Status</a>, her Platinum rank pick rate is up 72%, her Diamond rank pick rate has shot up around 150%, and her pick rate at Master rank and above has risen almost 250% recently.

It's actually planned to have a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/apex-legends-the-board-game\">Kickstarter campaign</a>, which launches May 17, but with a game as popular as Apex, it's pretty likely to be successfully funded.

While the game's board itself hasn't been shown off yet, or what it will actually be like to play the game, a press release promises a \"fully-immersive, three-dimensional environment taken straight from the screen.\" <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-the-board-game-revealed\">Read more</a> ",

REMASTERED LEGEND CLASSES In Revelry, Legends have been reorganized on the Legends Screen according to their Class. You’ll be able to see their associated Class perk on top of that Legend’s unique abilities. This reorganization will help players identify Legends that play or support the team in a similar manner, and help them understand the new roles easier. There will be 5 Classes: Assault Recon Skirmisher Controller Support CLASS PERKS Every Legend Class also now has an associated gameplay perk that grants the Legends of that class access to new strategic options in the game. At casual levels of play, these new gameplay benefits will be fun new bonuses to engage with and empower decision-making. At higher levels of play, a squad make-up now determines what gameplay elements the team will have access to, and what they’re leaving behind. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/35155b2f132b9acb296a5466c82c40744b909df7.png Read more about how Remastered Legends will work in our developer update here. https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/revelry-season-game-updates TEAM DEATHMATCH, PERMANENT LIMITED-TIME MODE ROTATIONS At the launch of Revelry, we’ll be debuting Team Deathmatch to the Apex Games – a no holds barred brawl between two teams of six – which will be available for the first three weeks of the season. This has been our most requested mode, and we’re excited for players to check in out. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/revelry-patch-notes/apex-legends-revelry-patch-notes-asset-03.png.adapt.1920w.png In Team Deathmatch players will be able to select their Legend and weapon loadouts, similar to Control, with respawns occurring automatically after death. The first team to score 30 kills wins the round, and the first team to win two rounds wins the match. Loadouts will shuffle in between rounds, and you can always swap between them and your selected legend while waiting to respawn after death. Make sure to keep an eye out for periodic airdrops throughout the map which come loaded with Care Package and gold-kitted weapons. MIXTAPE PLAYLIST Following the first three weeks of Team Deathmatch, we’re thrilled to introduce a brand new way to enjoy some of our more highly requested LTMs on a permanent rotation with our Mixtape Playlist. This new mode queue provides players with the opportunity to jump right into frenetic and engaging combat experiences between our quick respawn modes: Control, Team Deathmatch, and Gun Run. These modes give ample opportunity to experiment and practice with weapons and Legends outside of our core BR experience, with little downtime between fights and respawns. NEW WEAPON: NEMESIS https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/revelry-patch-notes/apex-legends-revelry-patch-notes-asset-04.png.adapt.1920w.png It’s been a while since we unleashed a new weapon and the wait will be over when Revelry launches with a new energy weapon: The Nemesis, a new energy class assault rifle that fires four rounds per burst. With a ramping burst delay that decreases the time between bursts and simulates a fully automatic weapon, we’re hoping to see this potentially unseat favorite standbys like the R-301 and Flatline. FIRING RANGE UPDATES https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/revelry-patch-notes/apex-legends-revelry-patch-notes-asset-01.png.adapt.1920w.png Added options to customize your firing range experience Dummies can now strafe left and right! You control how fast they move, whether they should crouch, and their shield level. Dynamic stats appear any time you deal damage, letting you track your performance. Hit indicators help you keep track of spray patterns. Unlimited ammo means no more trips back to the gun racks to reload. This is the first of several rounds of updates to the firing range, so we will keep an eye on how the community uses the new tools. ORIENTATION MATCHES New to the Outlands? Try the new Orientation Match system, meant to create an easy introduction where new players can get their bearings and learn the core mechanics of Apex Legends. To participate in Orientation matches you have to be a brand new player or party up with a new player to take out some bots before joining the regular matchmaking queue.

While this celebration <em>is</em> going to work in the same way as previous collection events, Respawn is being a lot more generous when it comes to Apex Packs in the reward tracker. Starting on February 14, the Apex Legends Anniversary collection event sees a full set of recolours and community-created cosmetics available in the in-game store and select Event Apex Packs. There <em>have </em>been some minor cosmetic changes introduced to these skins - so, they're not completely recycled content - but it's still not quite as fresh as you'd like. Still, completing the collection event will bag you 150 Heirloom Shards - and a set of slick legend skins. So, if you want to get a headstart on that, you'll be pleased to know that the Anniversary collection event reward tracker doesn't just contain <em>five</em> Apex Packs, it contains two Event Apex Packs - something we haven't seen available in a reward track for quite some time. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/free-packs-anniversary-event\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/team-deathmatch-matchmaking-issues-season-16\">Apex Legends Team Deathmatch gets a speedy and vital update</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/classes\">Apex Legends classes explained - each new character class in-depth</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-release-time\">Apex Legends Season 16 release time nears as we gear up for Revelry</a> ",

This makes quite a bit of sense, when you think about what Respawn Entertainment is doing to refresh the legend meta, but it also coincides near-cosmically with the closure of the Apex Legends mobile game. With both Fade and Rhapsody seemingly ready to go, you might agree with the sentiment that <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/rhapsody-fade-mobile-shutdown\">Apex Legends' exclusive mobile characters need the console treatment</a>. However, in a pre-release Season 16 preview event, Apex Legends' game director Steve Ferreira has made it clear that battle royale players shouldn't expect to see mobile exclusive content in Apex Legends anytime soon. Discussing this during a short Q&A session with the media, Ferreira expressed that Respawn Entertainment doesn't plan to introduce any mobile exclusive content to Apex Legends. \"The content we created in Mobile was intended for one type of experience and HD is a different type of experience,\" Ferreira says - with the term \"HD\" referring to the main Apex Legends game you see on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Xbox consoles. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/mobile-exclusive-content-not-coming\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tsm-imperialhal-algs-split-1-playoffs-2023\">TSM's ImperialHal on ALGS victory, NRG, and a Scump-like legacy</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-map-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 16 map changes bring back fan-favourite POI</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-care-package-weapons\">New Apex Legends Season 16 care package weapon getting \"super buffed\"</a> ",

From a brand new Apex Legends class system to a brand new assault rifle, there really is a lot to look forward to. However, the one stand-out addition that we're really excited about is Team Deathmatch. That's right, Apex Legends is finally getting a TDM mode - and it's bringing some familiar fun to this battle royale shooter. Detailing just what fans can expect when they jump into a game of Team Deathmatch on Apex Legends during a press event ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 16 release date</a>, game mode designer Marty Wong has explained that this iteration of the popular game mode \"should be pretty familiar for most people\" - but, that doesn't mean it won't be a lot of fun. Specifically, Apex Legends' Team Deathmatch is going to be a 6v6, fast-respawn mode with loadouts - quite a lot like Control - that is built around a best-of-three round format. What do we mean by this? Well, each team of six will need to earn 30 kills to win a round and, then, win two rounds to win the game. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/team-deathmatch-ltm\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tsm-imperialhal-algs-split-1-playoffs-2023\">TSM's ImperialHal on ALGS victory, NRG, and a Scump-like legacy</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-map-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 16 map changes bring back fan-favourite POI</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-care-package-weapons\">New Apex Legends Season 16 care package weapon getting \"super buffed\"</a> ",

Introduced in Season 9, this round-based three-versus-three mode was a decent alternative to Apex Legends' core battle royale mode; it also made a great place to practise your gunplay against live opponents, rather than taking to the Firing Range. However, whether you're a fan of Arenas or not, Apex Legends isn't just getting rid of it as a game mode; Respawn Entertainment is eventually replacing Arenas with a brand new playlist that fans have been asking for. As explained by Apex Legends' design director Evan Nikolich, Respawn Entertainment is going to replace Arenas with Season 16's new Team Deathmatch LTM - something this battle royale's fans have been waiting quite a while for. Going into Season 16, Respawn Entertainment \"want to create a safe space for players to get in practice\", according to Nikolich. So, they're \"doing that by first introducing TDM at the beginning of the season, and then following up with a new rotating mode called Mixtape\". This new playlist will feature \"some of the community's favourite modes\" - including Control and Gun Run. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-shut-down\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tsm-imperialhal-algs-split-1-playoffs-2023\">TSM's ImperialHal on ALGS victory, NRG, and a Scump-like legacy</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-map-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 16 map changes bring back fan-favourite POI</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-care-package-weapons\">New Apex Legends Season 16 care package weapon getting \"super buffed\"</a> ",

In fact, for the amount of time some people spend grinding out important win streaks in Ranked, the rewards are a little crummy.

However, all hope is not lost for the future. In a similar fashion to Season 15, Season 14, and the season before that, Apex Legends players can look forward to earning a new Season 16 skydive trail (if they reached, Diamond rank, Master rank, or Apex Predator rank), and a Season 16 Apex Predator rank badge (if they made it that far). However, that's pretty much it. Thankfully, this could be something that changes in the future. Speaking to press during a pre-release preview showcasing all the new changes and content coming in this battle royale's Season 16 update, design director Evan Nikolich has confirmed that Respawn Entertainment is \"evaluating the whole system holistically\".

Unlike other battle royale games, though, Apex Legends players can find themselves finding some of the game's best weapons in periodically dropped care packages - or, craft them at any point in the Replicator. This season is changing quite a lot about Apex Legends, but not that - thankfully. So, if you're wondering what the <strong>Apex Legends Season 16 care package weapons</strong> are, and what you'll be able to build in the Replicator, you're in the right place - and one of these weapons is going to hit very hard. Shared with press during a pre-release preview event of Season 16, Apex Legends' lead weapon designer Eric Canavese has confirmed that the Hemlock, a burst-fire assault rifle, is replacing the Rampage - so, expect to see this popular light machine gun back as floor loot. It's our understanding that Apex Legends' RE-45, Bocek Bow, and the ever-popular Kraber will also be available in this battle royale's care packages. We haven't seen the latest set of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes</a> yet, but we're expecting everything to be the same in terms of how these weapons come - meaning the RE-45 should still have Disruptor Rounds. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-care-package-weapons\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tsm-imperialhal-algs-split-1-playoffs-2023\">TSM's ImperialHal on ALGS victory, NRG, and a Scump-like legacy</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-16-map-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 16 map changes bring back fan-favourite POI</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-map-rotation-update\">Apex Legends' Ranked map rotation is expanding in Season 16 update</a> ",

They haven't just recorded a bunch of gameplay clips, though. This test, this somewhat scientific experiment, has been conducted with almost every influencing factor in mind. Not only has Pescodar taken the average readings from a \"timescale\", rather than just noting a character's peak audio output, they have also conducted this experiment on three different in-game surfaces: dirt, stone, and metal. In an effort to reinforce any findings they might have stumbled onto, they also tested two of the characters in live games on World's Edge and two games on Broken Moon.

        "contents": "Join us in celebrating the dawn of a new year in the Celestial Sunrise Collection Event! We’re introducing a new limited-time mode that will put your skills to the test called Hardcore Royale, and our reward track is packed with great cosmetics to unlock including the new Reactive Peacekeeper! HARDCORE ROYALE It’s time to bring your A-Game to the ultimate test of the Apex Games. Hardcore Royale is much like Trios, but with some fun changes that will make information sharing amongst your squad critical. Make sure to count your shots, and always keep the Ring in mind. Let’s break down what to expect when you drop. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/celestial-sunrise-collection/celestial-sunrise-collection-event-1.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Armor is restricted to white armor only, and can’t be upgraded through dealing damage, crafting, or looting. While this makes it easier to take down your enemies, keep in mind you’ll be just as vulnerable. Helmets have also been removed making headshots more lethal/rewarding. Pick your fights carefully, Legend. Or it could all be over in the blink of an eye. Additional gameplay changes for Hardcore Royale are listed below. Hardcore Royale Changes: Limited HUD White Armor Only No Helmets Armor doesn’t spawn in Deathboxes (No Armor Swapping) Ring starts at max Damage Like Ranked, Hardcore Royale will be LIMITED to Accounts Level 20 and above. So be sure to level up your account before it drops to get in on the intense action. Hardcore Royale will not be a takeover, meaning regular trios will still be available during it’s run. Two more Limited Time Modes will be coming to the Apex Games after the Collection event! CELESTIAL SUNRISE COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS Unlock 24 enchanting limited-time cosmetics, with Legendary skins for Octane, Pathfinder, Caustic, Ash and more! All 24 items will be available in exchange for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals and in Celestial Sunrise Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you unlock them all before the event ends, you’ll automatically receive “Jadeite Retribution”, a new Reactive Peacekeeper Skin! REWARD TRACKER You can earn up to 1,600 points per day and challenges refresh daily. All these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass so you can complete multiple challenges at once. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/celestial-sunrise-collection/celestial-sunrise-collection-event-2.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Learn more: https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/celestial-sunrise-collection-event Launch The Game Now Lion Guard Bundle: Jan 24 - Feb 7 Legendary Caustic Skin “Lion Guard” 7x Apex Packs Opalescent Serpent Bundle: Jan 24 - Feb 7 Legendary Ash Skin - “Opalescent Serpent” 3x Apex Packs Cybernetic Payload Bundle: Jan 24 - Jan 27 Legendary Fuse Skin “Cybernetic Payload” Epic 30-30 Repeater Skin “Time Circuit” Galactic Guardian Bundle: Jan 24 - Jan 27 Legendary Horizon Skin “Galactic Guardian” Legendary Alternator Skin “Combined Powers” Void Prowler Bundle: Jan 24 - Jan 27 Legendary Wraith Skin “Void Prowler” Legendary Wingman Skin “Hammer Down” Inflight Entertainment: Jan 24 - Jan 27 Valkyrie Skydive Emote “Inflight Entertainment” Hypnotic Nightmare Unlock Bundle: Jan 24 - Jan 27 Epic Valkyrie Skin “Hypnotic Nightmare” Valkyrie Character Unlock Silver Age Bundle: Jan 27 - Jan 31 Legendary Wattson Skin “Silver Age” Legendary Hemlok Skin “Golden Arrow” Protector of the Void Bonus Bundle: Jan 27 - Jan 31 Legendary Wraith Skin ”Protector of the Void” 2x Wraith Pack Plumed Explorer Bundle: Jan 27 - Jan 31 Legendary Loba Skin “Plumed Explorer” Legendary R-301 Skin “Pieces of Eight” Style And Grace: Jan 27 - Jan 31 Seer Skydive Emote “Style And Grace” Guerilla Ghoul Unlock Bundle: Jan 27 - Jan 31 Epic Revenant Skin “Guerilla Ghoul” Revenant Character Unlock Wise Warrior Bundle: Jan 31 - Feb 3 Legendary Bloodhound Skin “Wise Warrior” Legendary G7 Scout Skin “Regal Spike” Worlds Apart Bundle: Jan 31 - Feb 3 Legendary Lifeline Skin “Worlds Apart” Legendary Havoc Skin “Emerald Abstraction” Ring Leader Bonus Bundle: Jan 31 - Feb 3 Legendary Gibraltar Skin “Ring Leader” Legendary Prowler Skin “Burst of Courage” 3x Gibraltar Stat Trackers Target Practice: Jan 31 - Feb 3 Bangalore Skydive Emote “Target Practice” White Lightning Unlock Bundle: Jan 31 - Feb 3 Rare Octane Skin “White Lightning” Octane Character Unlock Imperial Defender Bundle: Feb 3 - Feb 7 Legendary Gibraltar Skin “Imperial Defender” Legendary Spitfire “Casket Decor” Man Made Man Bundle: Feb 3 - Feb 7 Legendary Mirage Skin “Man Made Man” Legendary Charge Rifle “Hard Coded” My Wave Bonus Bundle: Feb 3 - Feb 7 Legendary Lifeline Skin “My Wave” Legendary R-99 Skin “Sirens Song” Weapon Charm “Luminous Lanyard” 3x Lifeline Stat Trackers Nevermore: Feb 3 - Feb 7 Bloodhound Skydive Emote Festive Decor Unlock Bundle: Feb 3 - Feb 7 Epic Fuse Skin “Festive Decor” Fuse Character Unlock",

When it comes to popular Apex Legends characters, it may come as no surprise to you that Octane has benefitted hugely from Horizon's decline. As per <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/game-stats/legends-pick-rates\">Apex Legends Status</a>, Octane's pick rate is up almost 5% across all ranks. Meanwhile, comparatively, Horizon's is down over 8%. When you look specifically at Platinum-rank players, these numbers are +10.2% and -13.3%. For Diamond-rank players, this swing is even <em>more</em> dramatic with Horizon down over 21% and Octane <em>up</em> 20.3%. If you want to go even higher, you'll see that Octane is up a whopping 27.6%.

However, the highlight of this event is going to be - without a doubt - Apex Legends' Hardcore Royale LTM. If you're a Vantage main - or a deft hand with a Kraber - you're in for a treat.

Players are going to be restricted to White Armor, that doesn't spawn in Deathboxes - so it can't be swapped out. The storm ring is also going to start at maximum damage, making it even more of a threat than usual. Topping things off, players are going to have limited HUD options. While no details have been given here, we can imagine the game's mini-map is going to be one thing missing. Oh, and it's also worth mentioning that no one's going to have a helmet.

For Wraith mains, this was quite exciting news - many of whom also feel as though the legend could do with more inspect animations when it comes to this rare item.

Now, we know that talk of \"algorithms\", \"buckets\", and \"skill ratings\" can get a little confusing - and Duc talks about all that a lot when detailing how the current Apex Legends matchmaking system works and how Respawn Entertainment approaches matchmaking - but, the changes being made are actually quite easy to understand when you think about it. Apex Legends' new SBMM system is going to compensate for the advantage pre-made duos and trios have, measure player skill more accurately, and dynamically fill lobbies with waiting times in mind.

We don't know about you, but we certainly think Horizon herself Elle Newlands would have something to say about this. Several days ago, Respawn Entertainment introduced the Spellbound Collection Event - and a title update with a fresh set of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes</a> - to the battle royale shooter. For the most part, this was a welcome update. In spite of continual criticisms from the community on the BR's monetisation, the Spellbound Collection Event saw the ever-popular Control LTM return alongside Seer's heirloom item and quite a few interesting cosmetics. One thing the aforementioned patch notes failed to mention among the minor weapon balancing changes and bug fixes, however, was a rather secret Horizon nerf. Not only did Respawn Entertainment reduce weapon accuracy while ascending in Horizon's tactical ability Gravity Lift, it also reduced the affect of her Black Hole ultimate ability through walls and obstacles. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-pick-rate-spellbound\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-ranked-split-2-start-time\">Apex Legends' Season 15 Ranked Split 2 start time, next map, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks, Season 15 ranked split, RP changes, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/reactive-weapon-skins-broken\">Apex Legends' reactive weapon skins are being broken by latest update</a> ",

But, we all know that doesn't mean anything when it comes to supposed balancing changes. Respawn Entertainment has made some alterations to Horizon's kit and they're undeniably nerfs. The first - and likely the most impactful - change made was to Horizon's Gravity Lift tactical ability.

Even players trying desperately to climb the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks</a> choose who they're using next game based on arbitray factors like which character's voice lines they like hearing the most, or which character they unlocked a cosmetic for most recently. These factors, while important to each and every one of our personal experiences with a game like Apex Legends, have absolutely no bearing on how good one character is compared to another. Yet, as we have seen with each new season of Apex Legends (thanks to statistics from <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/\">Apex Legends Status</a>), it can influence pick rates. This, in turn, influences which Apex Legends characters people play as - especially if you're just looking online to find out who's the best - and misinforms the meta further. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/meta-pick-rates-pro-players\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-cloud9-releases-roster\">Cloud9 releases its Apex Legends roster a month into new ALGS season</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/prestige-skin-colour-picker-concept\">This Apex Legends update would make Prestige skins worth unlocking</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/wintertide-collection-event-start-time\">Apex Legends Wintertide event start time - when's Winter Express back?</a> ",

Announced through a series of TwitLonger posts by its players <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss6l83\">Paris 'StayNauhgty' Gouzoulis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss6l87\">Zach 'Zach' Mazer</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss6l84\">Aidan 'rocker' Grodin</a>, Cloud9 will be dropping its support for the trio after they mutually agreed to terminate their contracts. All three are now unrestricted free agents. According to Zach and StayNaughty's posts, the current economic situation has seen some of Cloud9's sponsors \"cut back\" on spending and support, which in turn has led to a lack of funding for the Apex Legends division of the organisation. Zach also says that \"I feel 100% confident without org problems we would be sticking together\". This is despite a rocky start to Year 3 of the ALGS performance-wise, which sees the team sitting dangerously close to the Pro League relegation zone in the North America region. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-cloud9-releases-roster\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/prestige-skin-colour-picker-concept\">This Apex Legends update would make Prestige skins worth unlocking</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/wintertide-collection-event-start-time\">Apex Legends Wintertide event start time - when's Winter Express back?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/christmas-event-winter-express-ltm-teaser\">Apex Legends' Christmas event coming with Winter Express LTM teaser</a> ",

One thing that's leaving fans a little disappointed, though, when it comes to these cosmetics is the Prestige skins Respawn Entertainment are starting to pepper into the battle royale's Collection Event rewards - instead of Heirloom items. While these skins are far from bad cosmetics, they cost Apex Legends players a lot to unlock and they're not quite as customisable as they could be, given that this is something of a unique selling point for these items. We know this is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-battle-royale-game\">best battle royale games</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">best competitive FPS games</a> out there, but it's disappointing. So, one Apex Legends content creator has suggested one small - but very effective - change to make it all worthwhile. Apex Legends content creator and leaker '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/z9zs0a/i_made_a_simple_concept_for_prestige_skins_that/\">KralRindo</a>' has taken to the Apex Legends subreddit to share his conceptual colour picker for Apex Legends' Prestige skins. As you'll be able to see for yourself below, KralRindo has introduced a simple colour grid where players can choose the primary, secondary, and emmissive colours for any Prestige skin they unlock. If you're not sure what \"emmissive\" means, in this context it's referring to any sorts of lights on a skin. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/prestige-skin-colour-picker-concept\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/wintertide-collection-event-start-time\">Apex Legends Wintertide event start time - when's Winter Express back?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/christmas-event-winter-express-ltm-teaser\">Apex Legends' Christmas event coming with Winter Express LTM teaser</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ash-buff-arc-snare-silence\">This small Apex Legends Ash buff could make her a top tier legend</a> ",

First featuring in Season 3's Holo-Day Bash Collection Event, this would be the fourth time battle royale players will be able to jump into the high-intensity action on offer. Why do we think Apex Legends' Winter Express LTM is coming back? Well, Respawn Entertainment tweeted an image of the World's Edge train - which serves as the setting for this LTM - with a series of snowflakes. It didn't explicitly say that the Winter Express LTM was coming back, but it seems very likely given what Respawn Entertainment has offered players in the past - and the tweet, which you can see for yourself on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1597658702555000833\">PlayApex social media account</a> here.

So, in an effort to counter these impractical situations that leave Lifeline's healing abilities a little useless, fans of this game believe that Respawn Entertainment should draw on another hero shooter when it comes to bolstering the medics in Apex Legends. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/new-healer-stim-pistol\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ash-buff-arc-snare-silence\">This small Apex Legends Ash buff could make her a top tier legend</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/concept-art-storm-point-maps\">Early Apex Legends concept art shows a very different Storm Point</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-bug-finishing-move-spam\">Apex Legends Horizon bug defies physics with finishing moves</a> ",

How will DarkZero fare in North America after winning the Split 2 Playoffs and Year 2 Championship representing APAC South? Will Pioneers (ex-GMT) remain on top in EMEA? Will Parkha leaving aD for Crazy Racoon shake things up in APAC North? Can APAC South continue to establish itself as one of the dominant regions in the ALGS? After a busy off-season with a flurry of roster changes in South America, can anyone challenge Singularity for the top spot in the region? Tune in this weekend to watch all the action live! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/1aebd84ff0102ef82154054d0d6bf23e77e1102d.jpg https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/compete/news/year3-proleague-begins",

Despite hopes that <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-scan-meta-counter\">Apex Legends' Catalyst would be Seer's worst nightmare</a> - thanks to her scan-blocking Dark Veil ultimate ability - battel royale players are quickly discovering that this giant wall of ferrofluid is actually more of a hinderance than a help when it comes to dealing with an enemy Seer and his squad. Why do we think Catalyst should be bumped down a tier or two on our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a>? Well, while Catalyst's Dark Veil ultimate ability does appear to block Seer's Focus of Attention tactical ability and Bloodhound's Eye of the Allfather tactical ability, it doesn't actually block Seer's Exhibit ultimate ability. You know, the scan ability that everyone <em>wants </em>to have a counter for. If you haven't managed to try using Catalyst to climb the Apex Legends ranks yet and you're not sure why this is actually that much of an issue, a Reddit post from '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/ykzl9i/catalyst_is_more_of_a_liability_against_scan/\">NuggetHighwind</a>' explains why, and the comment section is full of people sharing similar excperiences - and grievances. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-complaints-scan-counter\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-counter-gibraltar-newcastle\">Gibraltar and Newcastle are Catalyst's kryptonite in Apex Legends</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-24-hours-kill-record\">Cracked Apex Legends player racks up 874 Catalyst kills in first day</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapon tier list - the best season 15 guns</a> ",

As a teenager on Boreas, Tressa Crystal Smith and her coven of friends prayed for and by the light of their broken moon. But fate brought her up to it when she ran away at fifteen to join a terraforming crew working to rebuild the moon. She took to the work, feeling a connection between her work with ferrofluid and the rituals of her past. But the unwelcome arrival of the Apex Games brought her peaceful life to an end. Now she joins the Games as Catalyst, a Legend determined to bring change and defend her home. She can use her ferrofluid to reinforce doors, form piercing spikes and obscure the playing field with high ferrofluid walls. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and by the time her opponents make the call? It’ll be far too late. PASSIVE: Barricade Reinforce doors, strengthening them and locking them to enemies' spaces where doors have been destroyed can also be reinforced. TACTICAL: Piercing Spikes Throw out a patch of Ferrofluid which turns into spikes when enemies are near. Catalyst remains immune to enemy spikes. ULTIMATE: Dark Veil Raise a permeable wall of Ferrofluid. Enemies who walk through it will be slowed and partially blinded for a brief time.

Prior to today's announcement, looking at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha_VsTDmoGg&t=63s\">Eclipse launch trailer</a>, we thought <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-launch-trailer-catalyst-valorant-viper\">Catalyst might have abilities like Valorant's Viper</a>. However, now, we know the truth about Catalyst's abilities and they're all pretty incredible. Discussing this ability kit in a pre-season press event, game designer OT Harrison highlighted that Catalyst should work well in both defence-oriented squads and squads built around aggression. \"Catalyst is all about controlling the battlefield.. versatility with her ferrofluid gives her abilities a unique flavour\", Harrison explains. \"She's a great option for mid-to-long range fights\", for players who want to keep enemies at bay, \"or to facilitate safer rotations and healing opportunities\", for players who need a moment to reset. Adding to this, when asked specifically about Catalyst's synergies, Harrison suggested that she \"synergises pretty well with other defensive legends\", going on to say that \"a team of Caustic, Wattson, and Catalyst can really turn any indoor space into their own playground\". <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-gameplay-aggressive-defensive\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-vfx-intensive-dev-comment\">Catalyst is Apex Legends' most \"VFX intensive\" character yet</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks, Season 15 ranked split, RP changes, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-abilities\">All Apex Legends Catalyst abilities</a> ",

Whether it's Bloodhound's Eye of the Allfather tactical or Seer's Exhibit ultimate, Respawn Entertainment hasn't introduced a way for players to actually counter these revealing tactics.

After meeting a younger Catalyst and her lunar coven, we get to hear her talk plainly about her transition during a tender moment with her friend Margo, making her status as a trans woman definitive for all to see. The trailer ends with an eco-terrorism plot against Hammond Robotics, likely leading her to the Apex Games soon after. Honestly, this hits every beat for me on exceptional representation; her goth witch aesthetic, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-launch-trailer-catalyst-valorant-viper\">almost-magical abilities</a>, and amazing voice direction (by an actual trans voice actor, no less) make Catalyst a fantastic addition to a roster already brimming with colourful, standout characters. It's rare for me to see a character - let alone a trans one - that I feel represents me and what I enjoy, but this is partially due to a lack of attempts at all. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-trans-love\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-launch-trailer-catalyst-valorant-viper\">Apex Legends' Catalyst might have abilities like Valorant's Viper</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-map-teaser-revenant-out-of-bounds\">Apex Legends' Revenant can break out of bounds in new map teaser</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fortnite/wolfscent-ability-apex-legends\">Fortnite Wolfscent ability borrows from Apex Legends' Bloodhound</a> ",

Well, while we don't have confirmation just yet that <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-abilities\">Apex Legends' Catalyst leaked abilities</a> are accurate, the Eclipse launch trailer does show the new terraforming legend throwing up a rather large wall of ferrofluid - something that looks strikingly similar to Viper's Toxic Screen signature ability in Valorant. Adding to this, a little earlier in the new cinematic, we see Catalyst launch a puddle of ferrofluid at Maggie and Fuse. This appears to stop them in their tracks, leaving them open to attack from Catalyst and her squad - made up of Bloodhound and Rampart. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-launch-trailer-catalyst-valorant-viper\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-trans-love\">I love that Apex Legends' Catalyst was made with love</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-map-teaser-revenant-out-of-bounds\">Apex Legends' Revenant can break out of bounds in new map teaser</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fortnite/wolfscent-ability-apex-legends\">Fortnite Wolfscent ability borrows from Apex Legends' Bloodhound</a> ",

Well, most of the time, anway. This Fortnightmares, though, Epic Games is borrowing a little something from Respawn Entertainment in the form of the Fortnite Wolfscent ability. This unique feature attributed to the Howler Claws, which are only available in-game during the Fortnightmares event, bear a striking resemblance to parts of Bloodhound's kit, a tracker from Apex Legends. Allow us to explain. When you have Fortnite's Howler Claws equipped, you can activate something called Wolfscent. Available for a limited time before a cooldown period, this ability will give you tracking vision and repeatedly mark enemies in a nearby area. Does this sound at all familiar? Well, if you play Apex Legends, it might. This sounds like a strange amalgamation of Bloodhound's Eye of the Allfather tactical and Beast of the Hunt ultimate. Interestingly, to balance this ability, <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-v22-20-party-hard-during-fortnitemares-2022\">Epic Games</a> has introduced something of a Dead By Daylight-esque heartbeat that will start when you're being tracked by someone else using the Wolfscent ability's tracking vision and grow louder the closer they get. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fortnite/wolfscent-ability-apex-legends\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-launch-trailer-catalyst-valorant-viper\">Apex Legends' Catalyst might have abilities like Valorant's Viper</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-map-teaser-revenant-out-of-bounds\">Apex Legends' Revenant can break out of bounds in new map teaser</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-voice-actor-one-piece-smite-borderlands\">Apex Legends Catalyst voice actor has starred in Smite and One Piece</a> ",

Described as an \"experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer\" by <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/eclipse\">Respawn Entertainment</a> here, Catalyst was a hero long before she found herself with the ability to \"manipulate the battlefield\" with ferrofluid.

In the latest Stories from the Outlands short, titled Last Hope, we see Catalyst trying to find out what happened to the aforementioned friend in a conversation with Rampart. While it is a wonderfully emotive way to introduce the character to Apex Legends' rich universe, we still don't know what exactly she's capable of in-game. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-stories-from-the-outlands-reveal\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-voice-actor-one-piece-smite-borderlands\">Apex Legends Catalyst voice actor has starred in Smite and One Piece</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/catalyst-abilities\">Apex Legends Catalyst leaked abilities</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 15 release date, new Legend, and more</a> ",

Then, it's going to swap out for Control - which is far from a bad thing. But, if you're more interested in the meat and drink of this battle royale game - the battle royale modes - then you'll be intrigued to know that <strong>Horizon's pick rate is through the roof</strong>. At the moment, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-pick-rate-season-14\">over a quarter of Apex Legends' top players are now using Horizon</a>; and, she's quite popular with players in Platinum and above, too. Looking at <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/game-stats/legends-pick-rates/Masterpred\">Apex Legends Status</a>, you'll be able to see that she's the most popular legend in Platinum, the most popular legend in Diamond, and boasts a whopping 27% pick rate in Master and Apex Predator.

We know we have touched upon a <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-crypto-rework\">fan-made Apex Legends Crypto rework</a> before, but this time we're talking about everyone's favourite murder-robot Revenant. Redditor '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/y20l31/what_if_death_totem_transformed_you_into_a_shadow/\">Kvetanista</a>' thinks Revenant needs to embrace his darkness a little more and lean on Shadow Royale's shadows with his Death Totem ultimate ability - and, we're inclined to agree. In their Reddit post, Kvetanista simply suggests that Revenant and anyone else using Revenant's Death Totem should actually be transformed into a \"Shadow Royale type of shadow\" - rather than just getting the benefits of Death Protection for a limited time. This suggestion, as you might be able to imagine, has sparked something of a debate online - and we're not opposed to the idea of Respawn Entertainment shaking up Revenant's kit a little. Looking at the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pick-rates\">Apex Legends Season 14 pick rates</a>, he could be in a healthier place. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/revenant-buff-fans-death-totem-shadow\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/week-news-horizon-pick-rate-golden-ticket-season-15-teaser\">This Week in Apex Legends news: Horizon, Gun Run, and Golden Tickets</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/golden-ticket-season-15-teaser\">Apex Legends' Golden Ticket is your key to a new Season 15 teaser</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gun-run-ltm-fight-or-fright-event\">Here's when Apex Legends' Gun Run returns in Fight or Fright event</a> ",

If you're wondering why are we saying that this time around, it's because of the rather unusual Apex Legends' Golden Ticket item players are starting to see pop up in their Replicator menu.

Oh, and it's a pretty great way to get your hands on a golden gun in-game - because the Replicator throws one of them out at you as well. How do we know this is a teaser for Season 15, though?

Even if the core BR experience is excellent, these LTMs are almost always a delight. That's why we're so stoked to let you know that Apex Legends' Shadow Royale LTM is being replaced by the game's Gun Run LTM for week two of the spooky Fight Or Fright Halloween event. Yeah, you're reading that right. Apex Legends is swapping out the Fright of Shadow Royale for the Fight of Gun Run and players will be able to jump into this game mode for a whole week starting on October 11. If you're sitting there looking for some specifics, Respawn Entertainment hasn't confirmed the exact time the swap is being made. However, we're under the impression that it will be at the same time as every other Apex Legends update.

With a tragically dark backstory, fantastic jokes told by the talented Elle Newlands, and a kit that quite literally defies gravity, it's easy to see why. However, it seems that she's only growing more popular with each update - and each new face. Right now, just shy of two years since she was added to Respawn Entertainment's battle royale, Horizon is enjoying her highest pick rate in a long time - maybe even ever. Looking at <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/game-stats/legends-pick-rates\">Apex Legends Status</a>, across all ranks and modes, Horizon is currently enjoying a 7.7% pick rate, which is down somewhat from a high of over 8.5% in September 2022. However, this 7.7% pick rate is still much higher than her average pick rate for the entirety of Season 13 and before. To make matters even more interesting, Horizon is actually the most popular legend for players trying to climb <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends' ranks</a> in Platinum and above - by quite some margin, in some cases. For players in Gold and below, she's one of the top five most popular legends - interestingly joined by Octane, Wraith, Bloodhound, and Pathfinder. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-pick-rate-season-14\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gun-run-ltm-fight-or-fright-event\">Here's when Apex Legends' Gun Run returns in Fight or Fright event</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - RP, Season 14 ranked splits, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/week-news-rocket-launcher-titanfall-maps-ranked\">This Week in Apex Legends news: rockets, roller coasters, and ranked</a> ",

First things first, as it's finally Spooktober, we need to talk about the <strong>Apex Legends Fight or Fright event</strong> that kicked off on October 4. For this event, <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/fight-or-fright-event\">Respawn Entertainment is bringing back Shadow Royale</a> with a brand new map - Olympus After Dark - and a selection of terrifying Halloween-themed skins for players to spend their Apex Coins on. Interestingly, rather than introduce a two-week Reward Track for this event, Apex Legends players can look forward to four weeks of rotating LTM playlists throughout the month. Starting with the spooky Shadow Royale, players will be able to dive back into the popular Gun Run LTM from October 11 on Estates After Dark, Skulltown, and Fragment East. Then, from October 18, Control returns on Lava Siphon, Barometer, and Labs After Dark. At the end of the month, from October 25, players will be able to jump back into Shadow Royale on Olympus After Dark one more time. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/week-news-rocket-launcher-titanfall-maps-ranked\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gun-run-ltm-fight-or-fright-event\">Here's when Apex Legends' Gun Run returns in Fight or Fright event</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-pick-rate-season-14\">Over a quarter of Apex Legends' top players are now using Horizon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/leak-archer-rocket-launcher-model-titanfall\">Apex Legends might be getting a heavy rocket launcher in the future</a> ",

This time around, they have stumbled upon an unreleased weapon model - which was added to the game's files during the Beast of Prey collection event update. While we don't know too much about this new weapon, we do know that it's a heavy rocket launcher - something we haven't seen in-game before. In a short YouTube video, which you will be able to see for yourself below, KralRindo can be seen showing off the unreleased rocket launcher - named Archer - in-game with Lifeline. Its militaristic design is almost outdated compared to other IMC weapons we see in-game, suggesting it's older technology than other armaments available right now. Interestingly, it also features a flip-out built-in holographic sight, which might suggest that this is a weapon without any attachment slots. If you're a Titanfall veteran, you'll know this gun very well - it's one of best Anti-Titan weapons available. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/leak-archer-rocket-launcher-model-titanfall\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/planet-coaster-theme-park-18-months\">This Apex Legends Planet Coaster park took over 18 months to create</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pick-rates\">Apex Legends pick rates - the most popular characters in Season 14</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fight-or-fright-control-ltm\">Apex Legends Fight or Fright event resurrects Control LTM</a> ",

But, what if we took this incredibly popular <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">competitive FPS game</a> and translated it into a theme park? Well, one Planet Coaster expert has done just that - virtually, anyway. Talented theme park constructor and die-hard Apex Legends fan '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af0fEZQRG4s\">DoxNotch</a>' has created Amber Rock Station, an Apex Legends-themed theme park set in a former IMC frontier outpost, in Frontier Development's Planet Coaster and it deserves so much more praise. Not only is that incredible in itself, but it also took DoxNotch a whopping year and a half to put together. In DoxNotch's incredible Amber Rock Station theme park, players are able to explore and experience 13 attractions based on characters from Respawn Entertainment's free-to-play battle royale shooter - and each one has a little bit of a story to it, too. For example, take Wattson's Tesla Coiler - one of the first rides you come across when you enter Amber Rock Station. Visually, this ride is themed around Wattson's experimentations, electricity, and tesla coils - as you might already expect. However, DoxNotch explains that the concept behind this virtual experience is that the people riding the Tesla Coiler are actually there to weigh down the ride's spinning cars to help Wattson charge her latest inventions. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/planet-coaster-theme-park-18-months\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/leak-archer-rocket-launcher-model-titanfall\">Apex Legends might be getting a heavy rocket launcher in the future</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pick-rates\">Apex Legends pick rates - the most popular characters in Season 14</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fight-or-fright-control-ltm\">Apex Legends Fight or Fright event resurrects Control LTM</a> ",

Whether you play a lot of Apex Legends or not, it's clear that this is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-battle-royale-game\">best battle royale games</a> out there right now - and this is one reason why. We know it hasn't been confirmed that they will be free just yet, but established Apex Legends leaker '<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kralrindo/status/1574654820266303489\">KralRindo</a>' has revealed that there are two new ground emotes in the game's files - one for Bangalore, and one for Newcastle. Sharing this information, KralRindo details that the Bangalore emote is listed as 'bangalore_ground_emote_drinkingbros' and the Newcastle emote is listed as 'newcastle_ground_emote_chillaxingdrink'. With the two legends canonically siblings, and Apex Legends' pre-established history of introducing specific animations and voice lines to reflect the sibling relationship between the two characters, it seems somewhat likely that these two emotes will be linked in some way - and most-probably show an interaction between the two when used side by side. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/leaks-free-emote-bangalore-newcastle\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/yellow-symbol-mystery\">Apex Legends community stumped by mysterious yellow symbol</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/no-titanfall-weapons-dev-ama\">Here's why Apex Legends doesn't have more Titanfall weapons</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list - the best legends for Season 14</a> ",

Apex Legends may have fewer guns than Warzone and Fortnite, but they're balanced fairly well and offer a variety of gameplay opportunities to players. While there are a lot of players happy with the weapons in Apex Legends, there are quite a few who want to see more.

In his explanation, using Titanfall's Softball Anti-Armor Grenade Launcher as an example, Canavese details that the weapons in Titanfall are designed \"specifically for Titan combat\" and that Apex Legends' combat often just \"doesn't have those sorts of challenges\" for players to overcome. Discussing the Softball explicitly, he goes on to say that Respawn Entertainment would need to look at creating a new weapon category altogether for a grenade launcher - or develop it \"specifically as a care package weapon\". However, as he discusses in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/xjowz5/comment/ipd5e65/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">another Reddit comment</a>, the resources required to develop and introduce a new weapon to Apex Legends outweigh the impact it has on the game when it is limited to care package drops. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/no-titanfall-weapons-dev-ama\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/leaks-free-emote-bangalore-newcastle\">Apex Legends leaks hint at more secret free emotes for battle royale</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list - the best legends for Season 14</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/throwing-knife-aim-assist\">Apex Legends fans work out why they're whiffing throwing knives</a> ",

We know aim assist is a hot topic of contention for Apex Legends players, and the wider gaming community, but it's something that is ever present in the battle royale and shouldn't be ignored. If you're wondering why it's relevant to the topic of throwing knives in Apex Legends, though, allow us to explain. When you reach the final weapon in the Gun Run LTM, you're given a throwing knife to get the final kill with - and win the game, provided you don't get melee demoted.

However, Respawn has since addressed the criticism, providing an update on said skin and more. \"Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends,\" wrote Respawn in a <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/iron-sight-update\">blog post</a>. \"As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn't be a factor in the sights functionality as well. During Season 4, we released the Heat Sink reactive skin for the VK-47 Flatline rifle and we heard feedback from some players that the Aim Down Sights (ADS) felt superior to any other skin available. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/respawn-is-changing-those-supposed-pay-to-win-apex-legends-skins\">Read more</a> ",

Apex Legends' new Beast of Prey Collection Event is switching up crafter weapons, adding a limited-time event reward tracker, and introducing a new LTM to the game. While the mode itself does sound quite exciting, the real interesting thing about Apex Legends' Gun Run LTM is that it's going to be a testing ground for a brand new weapon: throwing knives. That's right, Apex Legends could very well be getting a new throwable in the future - and it's something Call of Duty fans will know very well, as it's commonplace in all the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/call-of-duty-warzone/best-loadout\">best Warzone loadouts</a>. Apex Legends' Gun Run LTM is actually a lot like Call of Duty's Gun Game, a free-for-all party mode where players need to kill one another to progress through a gauntlet of random weapons before using a throwing knife - or a tomahawk - to get one final kill and win the game. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gun-run-ltm-throwing-knife\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-crypto-rework\">Fan-made Apex Legends Crypto rework could solve his dismal pick rate</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-year-3-details\">Apex Legends Global Series Year 3 shakes up the ALGS Pro League</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-husaria-files-datamine\">Apex Legends' shelved Husaria might be playable character after all</a> ",

Despite being a legend that offers players quite a lot of utility, he just doesn't quite sit right with players - and that's why he's always on the tail end of our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a>. Thankfully, a handful of Apex Legends fans have detailed the Crypto rework this free-to-play battle royale needs and we're inclined to agree with the decisions they have made. The top-line talking point when it comes to this Crypto rework posted on Reddit by '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/xeh1z7/the_definitive_crypto_rework_oc/\">AstronomerSenior4236</a>' is the fact that Apex Legends' fans think that he should be able to use his tactical ability and passive ability independent of his drone - which still features heavily - and makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Discussing Crypto's passive ability first, it looks like Apex Legends fans want to see something somewhat similar to Vantage's Spotter's Lens passive. Proximity Firewall, which is what the fans have named this ability, would allow Crypto to detect the number of squads in a certain radius when aiming down sights while unarmed. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-crypto-rework\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-year-3-details\">Apex Legends Global Series Year 3 shakes up the ALGS Pro League</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-husaria-files-datamine\">Apex Legends' shelved Husaria might be playable character after all</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 15 release date - when does the next update drop?</a> ",

For Year 3, the overall structure ALGS will look similar to last year. There is still the top tier of the Pro League, and an amateur Challenger Circuit that feeds into that, for each major region. There is still the intention to host three LAN events throughout the season (although due to COVID, only two of the proposed three went ahead as in-person events in Year 2). And the overall prize pot for the season remains at a healthy $5 million. However, ALGS Year 3 will not be without some significant tweaks. For a start, the Pro League in each region will be shrinking from 40 teams (20 invited teams and 20 pre-season qualifier teams) to 30 (22 invited, eight pre-season qualifier teams). While this does mean fewer amateur teams will be able to qualify for the top tier of Apex Legends esports, ALGS commissioner John Nelson tells The Loadout why the decision has been made to narrow the field. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-year-3-details\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-crypto-rework\">Fan-made Apex Legends Crypto rework could solve his dismal pick rate</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-husaria-files-datamine\">Apex Legends' shelved Husaria might be playable character after all</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 15 release date - when does the next update drop?</a> ",

Following the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/maggie-legend-development\">Apex Legends' Maggie stole abilities designed for another legend</a> way back in February 2022, it looks like the lost legend known as Husaria is back - well, it looks like they could be back. Apex Legends fan and data miner '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/xc2t4k/new_legend_in_steam_files_husaria/\">ABAxStorm</a>' has highlighted a new folder in the battle royale shooter's game files related to Husaria - a long-lost leaked legend that, as we mentioned above, seems to have been adapted into Season 13's Maggie. However, this folder interestingly does suggest that Husaria may actually be their own Apex Legends character in the future - as this file folder is found among other files and folders for all the other already-established legends, maggie included. Of course, it's worth taking this with a grain of salt.

Quite a few Apex Legends fans think that Fuse and Crypto should be able to open Explosive Holds without the need for a grenade. Now, we know what you're thinking. These changes aren't going to make much of an impact on where these characters sit on our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a>, sure. However, the argument that Fuse's Knuckle Cluster tactical ability should be able to blow open an Explosive Hold is quite logical considering. In addition to this, when you consider the fact that Crypto is quite adept at hacking, it would also make logical sense for him to be able to hack open an explosive hold. Despite this being quite a minor addition, albeit a change that could be considered a buff, the argument then is that this same logic could apply to almost every legend on Apex Legends' roster. Bangalore and Gibraltar both have explosive-based abilities, so they should be able to blow up some Explosive Hold doors with them. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-fuse-crypto-explosive-holds\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-15-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 15 release date - when does the next update drop?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/prime-gaming-september-rewards\">Apex Legends' Amazon Prime Gaming September rewards leaked</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-gold-ultimate-accelerant\">Apex Legends fans add gold Ultimate Accelerant to their wishlist</a> ",

We know it, the devs know it, and the fans know it. What people don't necessarily know, or agree on, is where this improvement should come from. However, the Apex Legends community always has a handful of decent ideas and a few fans have been debating whether the game needs a gold variant of the Ultimate Accelerant item. While there's no telling whether this will ever come to fruition, we do think they are onto something with this wild idea. Apex Legends player and Horizon main '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/wwtsse/thoughts_on_a_gold_tier_ultimate_accelerant/\">HashBandicoot</a>' has taken to the Apex Legends subreddit to ask the community whether a gold-tier Ultimate Accelerant is a good idea or not. To them, this version of the unique regeneration-based equipment would fully charge a player's ultimate ability and offer them several unique perks - based on which legend they're playing as. It would take 14 seconds to use though - which is quite a long time in the thick of the fight. On the whole, despite some debate, the community seems quite onboard with the idea - and the suggestion that a gold variant Ultimate Accelerant should be added has led to some debate around when a legends' tactical ability should be recharged, too. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-gold-ultimate-accelerant\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/vantage-snipers-mark-hidden-buff\">Apex Legends' Vantage makes you a better sniper in more than one way</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-endorsement-honour-system\">Apex Legends fans want a League of Legends feature in battle royale</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-anyas-armor-skin\">Apex Legends actress reveals new Horizon skin is tribute to her cat</a> ",

Of course, the balanced nature of the game comes to mind - among other things - but, what if we told you that it wasn't quite as fair as it seems? Well... It isn't, really. Apex Legends fans are starting to clock onto a rather forgiving buff hidden within new-face Vantage's ultimate ability: Sniper's Mark. It turns out that her custom Sentinel sniper rifle must use bigger rounds than most, because the projectile hitbox for these shots is actually a lot larger than it is for other sniper rifles in-game. We know Vantage has found a decent spot in our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a> already, but we might have to bump her up. The sensation of landing a sniper shot you weren't expecting to in a firefight really is second-to-none, of course, and something you may have experienced yourself in the heat of battle. However, it looks like Vantage mains in Apex Legends are experiencing this a little more frequently than they expected - and there's a good reason for that. Quite a few Apex Legends players dedicated to uncovering the truth of these suspiciously successful shots have taken to the battle royale's training arena to test standard sniper rifle shots against Vantage's custom-built Sentinel - and the results are quite clear. As Redditor '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/wuphyv/bro_i_didnt_even_hit_the_horizon_but_it_still/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">Signal_Soup1170</a>' has expressed, Vantage's bullets are \"too damn thicc\". <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/vantage-snipers-mark-hidden-buff\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fans-endorsement-honour-system\">Apex Legends fans want a League of Legends feature in battle royale</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-anyas-armor-skin\">Apex Legends actress reveals new Horizon skin is tribute to her cat</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list - the best legends for Season 14</a> ",

There are a lot of ways to communicate with your squad in Respawn Entertainment's shooter, but apparently, it seems as though the Apex Legends community doesn't think there's enough. If you're someone who thinks there should be a way to praise and reward other players based on their in-game performance, you're not alone. Apex Legends fans want Respawn Entertainment to introduce an endorsement system to the battle royale - something like the endorsement system in Overwatch or League of Legends' honor system The conversation, sparked by Revenant main '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/wu77kw/could_we_get_a_way_to_thank_team_mates_who/\">Wiggles357</a>' on the Apex Legends subreddit, is all about finding a way for players in-game to effectively communicate their gratitude with other Apex Legends players for things like: getting knocked and not quitting, having good comms in-game, and \"just all around good sportsmanship\". Of course, as you might already know, Apex Legends does prompt players to say thank you to their squadmates when they're revived - and when they pick up an item pinged by another.

LEVEL CAP INCREASE Players can now level past account level 500 through 3 additional tiers of 500 levels bringing the effective level maximum to Level 500 Tier 3. This increase adds 345 additional Apex Packs earnable via account leveling, and ensures that everyone can earn an heirloom just by playing the game. The total number of Apex Packs earnable via account leveling is now 544. BATTLE PASS Certain Battle Pass challenges can now be completed in either Battle Royale or non-Battle Royale modes, giving you the flexibility to complete the Battle Pass your way.

However, we've got some bad news for you, as the pain isn't going to end there. A few hours after the release of the patch notes, Respawn put out a follow-up tweet with a rather glaring omission regarding Horizon's ultimate nerfs. On top of those outlined in the original notes, there is also a third (and for more significant) nerf to her Black Hole that has certainly got Horizon mains talking. \"One more change that didn't quite make it into the patch notes: Horizon's Black Hole is now susceptible to friendly fire/damage,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1556791163008389121?s=20&t=LX05b8l9Xh_YyOiZRJZ7pA\">Respawn tweets</a>. Couple this with the fact that the NEWT at the centre of the Black Hole is now easier to take out by enemies after being made weaker, and you've got an ult that can now quite easily be wiped out by both the opposition and even your own squad. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-horizon-nerfs\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list - the best guns in Season 14</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-kings-canyon-ranked-reaction\">Apex Legends' Kings Canyon rework already being slammed by pro players</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - RP, Season 14 ranked splits, and more</a> ",

While we already knew a little bit about what to expect from this <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> update, one thing that hasn't been revealed until now are the exact buffs and nerfs being dished out to the game's legends.

While many will focus on the huge and much-needed nerfs to Valk (and the surprising lack of nerfs to Seer, who grew massively in popularity throughout last season), there's one very interesting change to Mad Maggie that could be quite significant in Season 14. To combat her pretty awful pick rate, Respawn has buffed Maggie's Wrecking Ball ultimate - and it's about to piss off everyone it comes up against. Not only has Wrecking Ball's duration been doubled and can travel twice as far as it used to, it will now deal damage (thus potentially destroy) loads of legend utility, such as Loba's Black Market, Newcastle's Castle Walls, and Caustic's gas traps. The biggest shock of them all? It can now take out a Gibby dome. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/maggie-buffs-season-14\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-kings-canyon-ranked-reaction\">Apex Legends' Kings Canyon rework already being slammed by pro players</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - RP, Season 14 ranked splits, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list - the best guns in season 14</a> ",

In Season 14, we won't see quite as many massive shakeups to ranked as we did last season, but we will have a newly-reworked map to play on. In an interview with Respawn developers ahead of Season 14, The Loadout learned from lead level designer Jeff Shaw that for the first ranked split of Apex Legends Season 14, players will be dropping into the revamped Kings Canyon. Throwing the reworked map - which in the past has been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/kings-canyon-reforged-season-14-algs-rework\">not being as viable for high-level competitive play</a> as the other three maps in the battle royale game - straight into ranked rotation is a bold statement. However, Shaw is confident that the changes that have been made across Kings Canyon will make it \"more of a competitive map\" this time around. Various changes to the \"map health\" of Kings Canyon have been made, including better distribution of loot, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-skull-town-changes-relic\">a new POI in Relic</a>, and attempts to make existing POIs like Cage and Relay less campy and enclosed.

Alongside the new Apex Legends character and Kings Canyon map changes, Respawn Entertainment is introducing a new, increased level cap to Apex Legends on all platforms. Interestingly, this new level cap isn't going to be as simple as Apex Legends players going from level 500 to level 600, 700, and beyond. No, this level cap increase is actually a Call of Duty-like prestige system in disguise. Speaking to content creators and press during a pre-release Season 14 virtual panel, Apex Legends' experience design director Aaron Rutledge took a moment to explain what players can expect to see from the increased and expanded level progression coming to this battle royale with the Hunted update. \"In Season 14, we're going to expand the max level cap by looping through level one to 500 three additional times,\" Rutledge revealed. \" essentially raising the level cap to 2,000.\" As you might imagine, going forward players can expect to see a different badge design for their banner every 500 levels. Respawn Entertainment may not admit it, but it's clearly a levelling system somewhat similar to the prestige levelling system we've seen in Call of Duty titles for years. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-level-cap-increase\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-season-14-maps\">Apex Legends ranked Season 14 will kick off with new Kings Canyon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-skull-town-changes-relic\">Apex Legends' Skull Town POI back with a twist in Season 14 update</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-weapon-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 14 weapon changes switch up \"easy to use\" Wingman</a> ",

What are these huge weapon changes? Well, during a pre-season press event, senior game designer Eric Canavese confirmed that both of these weapons are going to be using different ammo types moving forward. If you want to use the Wingman in Season 14, you're going to need to use Sniper Ammo and Sniper Magazines. If you want to use the Spitfire, you're going to need to stock up on Light Ammo and keep your eyes peeled for a Light Magazine. If you're worried about these changes, you shouldn't be.

One of the most important ones, which could slip under the radar when you look at the latest <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes</a>, is this: Apex Legends' development team is finally removing Self Revive from the game. Yes, that's right - Self Revive is outta here and we couldn't be happier. In a pre-release press event, senior game designer Eric Canavese revealed that there would be two important changes made to gold-rarity equipment perks in the coming title update. Firstly, a Gold Backpack is no-longer going to offer players the Guardian Angel perk. Instead, it will feature a brand new gameplay perk: Deep Pockets. With this rare piece of equipment equipped, using Deep Pockets, players will be able to carry more large healing items in-game. This means that, moving forward, you will be able to three-stack both the Med Kit and Shield Battery in your inventory. In addition to this, you will be able to stack two Phoenix Kit items. This, of course, is going to help players individually - but, it could also introduce a new level of coordination between squad mates and encourage resource sharing in-game. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-self-revive-perk-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-season-14-maps\">Apex Legends ranked Season 14 will kick off with new Kings Canyon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-level-cap-increase\">Apex Legends' new level cap draws from classic Call of Duty feature</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-skull-town-changes-relic\">Apex Legends' Skull Town POI back with a twist in Season 14 update</a> ",

Alongside multiple reveals regarding Season 14 and significant changes to Kings Canyon, we’ve learnt more about Respawn’s long term goals via a Q&A – including info on cross progression, ranked changes, and in-game gifting. These further out additions haven’t got any date attributed to them yet, instead being tinkered with in the background. According to senior game designer Eric Canavese: &ldquo;We are actively working on gifting to other players right now, but we want to make sure it’s something people enjoy, something that doesn’t feel grindy&rdquo;. On Cross Progression, Evan stated: &ldquo;We’re actively working on cross progression, but there’s no release date on it. The game wasn’t built with it in mind, which makes it complicated. But I hear you, and I want cross progression too. It’s something we’re definitely working on – we want it sooner than later.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-gifting-cross-progression-control-pve-season-14\">Read more</a> ",

Interestingly, Respawn Entertainment doesn't think that the EVA-8 Auto shotgun is quite up to scratch. So, in an effort to once-again upset the established meta at the start of a new season, the developer of the free-to-play battle royale has opted to introduce an important EVA-8 buff to Apex Legends in the Season 14 update. While we don't know all the specifics of the weapon changes coming in Season 14 just yet (those will be in the next set of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes</a>), senior game designer Eric Canavese has confirmed a handful of the details during a pre-release press event. Following the Season 14 update, Apex Legends' EVA-8 is going to have an increased base fire rate and the boosted fire rate Shotgun Bolt attachments offer will also be more pronounced. Adding to this improvement, Canavese appeared to confirm that shotguns would be able to equip Stock attachments going forwards. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-eva-8-buff\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-season-14-maps\">Apex Legends ranked Season 14 will kick off with new Kings Canyon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-level-cap-increase\">Apex Legends' new level cap draws from classic Call of Duty feature</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-skull-town-changes-relic\">Apex Legends' Skull Town POI back with a twist in Season 14 update</a> ",

Canonically, despite a brief appearance as an Arenas map during the Genesis Collection Event in Season 9, Skull Town was destroyed in Season 5. Now, though, after all these long months, it's finally back. Skull Town has returned to Kings Canyon in Apex Legends' Season 14 update - but, there's one huge twist. What is this huge twist we're talking about? Well, the Skull Town POI we all know and love from Apex Legends' earlier seasons isn't returning exactly as it left. In fact, it's going to be different enough that Respawn Entertainment has decided to give it a brand new name: Relic. Now, we know what you're thinking... Is this new Relic POI really the same as Kings Canyon's Skull Town POI if they have completely changed the name of it? Well... No, of course it's not the same. Loba blew up the original Skull Town way back when. However, according to lead level designer Jeff Shaw, this is going to bring back the classic Kings Canyon gameplay we all know and love. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-skull-town-changes-relic\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-season-14-maps\">Apex Legends ranked Season 14 will kick off with new Kings Canyon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-level-cap-increase\">Apex Legends' new level cap draws from classic Call of Duty feature</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-14-weapon-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 14 weapon changes switch up \"easy to use\" Wingman</a> ",

Packing a custom sniper rifle and their pet bat, we see a bit of backstory teased as well as some hints towards what their ability kit could look like in game. As with all character launch trailers, we get a lot of time with Vantage allowing us to further understand the backstory established in the Stories from the Outlands trailer released earlier this week. Cutting between a firefight and a one-to-one with their mum in prison, the trailer (embedded below) gives a nice overview of what the deal with Vantage is. While initially not great in a fight, we see some pretty nifty sniping skills shown off in the trailer too, which give ample room for speculation in regard to her move set. For one, we see her pull down a visor over her right eye, identifying incoming enemies which fits in well with her scout / sniper archetype. We also see her send out her bat mid-combat - here’s hoping they play a bigger part in-game than a cute sidekick! <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-vantage-character-trailer-hutned\">Read more</a> ",

If seeing Post Malone getting dubs wasn't enough of a reward, he's also necked a shoey during his live stream to celebrate hitting a major fundraising goal. In a later stream on July 24, Post Malone has been raising thousands of dollars for The Trevor Project - one of the world's largest suicide prevention and mental health support charities for LGBTQ+ youth - and he decided the best way to celebrate a fundraising milestone was to drink some booze from a white converse. Of course, this is going to sound like a disgusting thing to do (and you'd be somewhat right), but doing a shoey is actually quite a popular thing to do in Australia - and, as Post Malone proves, around the world.

While the likes of Valk, Seer, and Gibraltar dominated the meta, we did see <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-championships-pick-rate-year-2\">a wide range of legends played</a> throughout the entire event. One surprise was Fnatic's Japanese roster seemingly picking Lifeline in a Grand Finals match, which was the only time in the entire tournament when the healer was picked. This soon transpired to be a misclick from Fnatic's Takamasa 'Meltstera' Kawai. That infamous Lifeline match (in which Fnatic actually placed well and scored points) has been lapped up by the Japanese Apex community, and now us English speakers can enjoy it too, thanks to one ALGS fan who has translated Fnatic's comms, revealing some hilarious moments from the team. Early on in the translated video by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sOzZxcnOdo&t=103s\">'k00k' on YouTube</a>, Fnatic's Yuga 'YukaF' Horie can be seen bursting into laughter and leaning back in his chair in disbelief as the team talks about rotations. \"Like... we have a Lifeline on our team,\" he says, to which teammate Keita 'MatsuTasu' Matsura replies with: \"The absolute worst character in the game.\" <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/lifeline-fnatic-algs-comms\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-year-2-lan-learnings\">Apex Legends esports must learn from its ALGS Championships mistakes</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gaiden-armed-dangerous-ltm\">Apex Legends Gaiden event brings back Armed and Dangerous LTM</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/valkyrie-pick-rate-algs-championship\">Valkyrie soars to top of Apex Legends pick rate charts after ALGS</a> ",

Culminating in the ALGS Championships Finals, we finally got to see Apex esports completely unshackled, with a big-money, high-stakes LAN event played in front of a live audience to crown the first ALGS world champion. Apex Legends esports has quickly become a personal favourite of mine to watch, especially at a time where my interest in a few other FPS esports has faded. EA has built the ALGS up gradually throughout the COVID era, and has a genuinely amazing product on its hands that really shone on that final day of the Championships. However, there was one major blip that cannot be ignored, and that's the unacceptable amount of qualified players and coaches that missed some or all of the tournament due to positive COVID tests or visa issues. According to <a href=\"https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/Apex_Legends_Global_Series/2022/Championship\">Liquipedia</a>, 15 qualified players or coaches were unable to attend the Championships in Raleigh, North Carolina this year due to visa issues. This includes the entirety of Team Empire's Russian roster, which was eventually replaced by AYM Esports, and two players from a further three teams. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-year-2-lan-learnings\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gaiden-armed-dangerous-ltm\">Apex Legends Gaiden event brings back Armed and Dangerous LTM</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/valkyrie-pick-rate-algs-championship\">Valkyrie soars to top of Apex Legends pick rate charts after ALGS</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-championships-pick-rate-year-2\">Every Apex Legends character got picked at ALGS Champs, except one</a> ",

The platform with the most exploiters by over 100 bans is PlayStation, followed by PC, Xbox, then the Nintendo Switch with only 20 bans.

Sure, it might not be <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/when-is-control-coming-back\">Apex Legends' Control</a> mode, but it's a fun spin on Apex Legends' traditional battle royale gameplay. In the Armed and Dangerous LTM, players are thrown into an otherwise standard battle royale match with one key difference: the only weapons in the loot pool are shotguns and snipers. Oh, and loot in general is going to be a lot harder to come by than usual. Armed and Dangerous is an LTM where a Legend Abilities matter a lot more than usual and players are going to have to think much more strategically about pushing enemy squads if they want to win.

Well, every legend except for one. Yep, throughout the four-day event, which saw 40 teams slog it out in dozens of matches on both World's Edge and Storm Point, all bar one legend saw some ALGS Championships action at some point, according to a Twitter post from caster Jon 'Falloutt' Kefaloukos. Even those with horrifically low pick rates in the upper echelons of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks</a> like Revenant, Rampart, and Lifeline got some love.

Of these 14, eight of them are already available in the console and PC version of Apex Legends - including Wattson, Horizon, Valkyrie, and Rampart. However, there are six that the leakers believe to be mobile-exclusive legends. Ahead of any official announcements, these six are known as: DJ (aka, Rhapsody), Spider, Amphere, Monkey King, Botanist, and Seeker.

However, they're not the only cosmetic item on offer - Respawn Entertainment is consistently introducing new weapon skins to the battle royale shooter, too. Ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/awakening-collection-event-start-date\">Awakening Collection release date</a>, lead hard surface MTX artist Oscar Aguirre has shared a detailed look at some of the new legendary weapon skins that will be available during the Awakening Collection Event - and, they look awesome. On June 16, following the official reveal of the upcoming Collection Event, Aguirre shared six images on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Oscreat\">personal Twitter account</a> showcasing upcoming legendary weapon skins for the Hemlock assault rifle, the Mastiff shotgun, the CAR submachine gun, the Bocek Bow, the Havoc assault rifle, and the Longbow marksman rifle. In a similar fashion to previous Collection Event cosmetics collections, each weapon skin shared by Aguirre has what you could describe as a 'matching' legend skin. This means that both the weapon skin and the legend skin share design cures and an overall theme - so, you can match them up if you're lucky enough to get your hands on both. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/awakening-collection-event-weapon-skins\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/awakening-event-release-time\">Apex Legends Awakening Collection Event release time countdown</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-returns-awakening-collection-event\">Apex Legends' Control mode returns soon with some new improvements</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/lifeline-buff-drone-infinite-health\">Apex Legends Lifeline buff gives her healing drone infinite HP</a> ",

When <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> Season 13 started, the battle royale's players were treated to an overhaul of the game's ranking system. The update, which has been dubbed Ranked Reloaded, saw changes to the assist timer duration and behaviour, kill RP values, entry costs, and ranked tier demotions. While quite a few players have seen this as a positive change, it has ultimately proven divisive, with claims that it's harder to maintain your rank - let alone climb the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks</a>. Thankfully, it looks like that's going to be a little easier. Recent Apex Legends leaks suggest that more changes are coming to Season 13's Ranked Reloaded update soon. These leaks have now been confirmed. As reported initially by <a href=\"https://www.dexerto.com/apex-legends/apex-legends-leak-reveals-ranked-changes-coming-with-lower-entry-costs-1849074/\">Dexerto</a>, \"reliable leaker\" '<a href=\"https://twitter.com/autismgaming420\">AG420</a>' has revealed that Apex Legends' development team are planning to release another update to the battle royale's ranked system alongside the next Collection Event - you can find out about the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/awakening-collection-event-start-date\">Awakening Collection Event release date</a> right here. The changes being made have now been confirmed to be primarily focused on the ranked mode's entry costs - with each division and tier now having an entry cost that's been lowered by 10 RP. There's also going to be improved RP for higher elimination counts to look forward to, as well. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-entry-cost-changes-season-13\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/awakening-collection-event-weapon-skins\">Apex Legends Awakening Collection Event weapon skins shown off by dev</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-returns-awakening-collection-event\">Apex Legends' Control mode returns soon with some new improvements</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/lifeline-buff-drone-infinite-health\">Apex Legends Lifeline buff gives her healing drone infinite HP</a> ",

What's really exciting about this Apex Legends Lifeline buff is the fact that it actually gives Lifeline's healing drone, D.O.C., infinite health. Yes, you read that correctly. D.O.C. is going to be indestructable from now on. It still lasts 20 seconds, but you no-longer have to worry about it being blown to smithereens in the heat of battle - D.O.C. is tough as nails now. If you're worried that that's it, fear not. There's so much more to this Lifeline buff than that - even if it doesn't look that way when you check out the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/awakening-collection-event\">Apex Legends blog</a>.

In fact, for a long time, there was only one option: Lifeline. This all changed at the start of Season 13, though, when Newcastle was introduced. His addition to the roster shook up the meta, along with our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a>, and he instantly became the number one support legend. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/newcastle-lifeline-pick-rate\">Newcastle's popularity saw Lifeline's pick rate tumble</a> dramatically - there was a new number one support legend in town. Now though, it appears that the natural order is being restored; Lifeline's pick rate has climbed above Newcastle's for the first time since his introduction. Days after Newcastle was introduced to the Apex Legends roster, Lifeline's pick rate hit an all-time low. Looking at the data gathered by <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/game-stats/legends-pick-rates\">Apex Legends Status</a> - a site that tracks pick-rates, average ranks, and more - it can be seen that Lifeline was only picked by roughly 3.8% of players. To put this into perspective, Lifeline's average pick rate has been declining for some time - however, she was sitting at an average of around 5% prior to Newcastle's introduction in Season 13. When she was at her lowest, Newcastle was at his highest - boasting a pick rate of over 10%. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/lifeline-newcastle-pick-rate\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapon-stickers-leak\">Apex Legends might be getting weapon stickers like Warzone</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bleed-effect-frame-rate-drop\">Apex Legends' bleed effect bug tanking battle royale frame rates</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/dev-comments-public-test-servers\">Apex Legends dev thinks battle royale would benefit from test servers</a> ",

While there are quite a few cosmetics in the battle royale shooter, there could always be more - and it seems as though Respawn Entertainment think that, too. Why? Well, a recent datamine has revealed information that suggests Apex Legends is getting weapon stickers in the future - a little like what you'd see in Call of Duty Warzone. Apex Legends YouTuber '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcPw0e2dGYI\">HyperMyst</a>' recently uploaded a video offering a short glimpse of datamined weapon stickers in Apex Legends - both the raw image files and the stickers plastered all over in-game weapons. Of course, it's hard to tell if these are legitimate or not - but they look it (and we think weapon stickers are a fantastic idea). The Apex Legends weapon stickers HyperMyst has offered us a look at showcase cartoonish chibi designs of Apex Legends' roster of characters. Those represented include Bloodhound, Wraith, Mirage, Octane, Wattson, and Horizon - among other designs. If Apex Legends' past with cosmetics is anything to go by, we could see a healthy selection of weapon stickers introduced through each in-game event and update - just like weapon charms and holo-sprays. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapon-stickers-leak\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/lifeline-newcastle-pick-rate\">Apex Legends' Lifeline pick rate more than Newcastle's for first time</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bleed-effect-frame-rate-drop\">Apex Legends' bleed effect bug tanking battle royale frame rates</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/dev-comments-public-test-servers\">Apex Legends dev thinks battle royale would benefit from test servers</a> ",

        "contents": "It's safe to say that there are quite a few reasons why <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> is one of the most popular battle royale games out there right now. One of those reasons is the fact that there's just so much going on in Respawn Entertainment's battle royale shooter. If you're someone who suffers frame rate drops in-game in the thick of a fight, we might know why that is. One player has identified that the Apex Legends bleed effect (which appears on-screen when you take damage) is actually the cause of the issues - at least for them. Taking to Reddit to ask for help, '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/uv8548/bug_low_health_overlay_significant_fps_drop/\">Reasonable-Law-9737</a>' has shared a number of screenshots showing a frame rate drop of 10fps or more when the \"low health overlay\" (which we're calling the bleed effect) appears on-screen. The initial numbers they offer up are from a standing position in Apex Legends' firing range. However, they report higher frame rate drops when this effect occurs while sprinting and \"even bigger numbers\" while in-game, as you can imagine. The Reddit user rightfully states that this is essentially punishing players who take damage in a fight while playing on lower-spec hardware - as they can't fight back as effectively. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bleed-effect-frame-rate-drop\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapon-stickers-leak\">Apex Legends might be getting weapon stickers like Warzone</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/dev-comments-public-test-servers\">Apex Legends dev thinks battle royale would benefit from test servers</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/newcastle-lifeline-pick-rate\">Apex Legends' Newcastle popularity sees Lifeline pick rate tumble</a> ",

Prior to his release, fans were concerned that his ability kit would overlap with Lifeline's and ultimately drown her out - and it looks like those concerns were somewhat justified. It's only been a week, but Newcastle is already being picked over twice as much as Lifeline in-game. Looking at <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/game-stats/legends-pick-rates\">Apex Legends Status</a>, we can see that at the time of writing Newcastle is being picked roughly 8% of the time. Meanwhile Lifeline is sitting at 3.9%. This equates to roughly a 5% change in popularity for Lifeline - a major drop. These numbers might seem small, but when you consider Apex Legends' huge player count, it's actually quite a large number of players. Of course, this could just be a temporary swing in popularity that reflects the fact that Newcastle is the newest legend in the game.

This point of interest is a beloved hotspot for early game drops, meaning a large chunk of the match population will be dropping there as their very first stop. But why is that? Well, for one, it’s massive. Even with a large number of squads dropping there, you’ll likely be able to find a decent amount of loot for you and your buddies to pick up and use against other squads. Secondly, due to its position being somewhat close to the centre of the map, it’s a great spot to rotate out from when the first or second circle starts drifting away. When the circle remains over Fragment, you can be certain that fresh squads will continue funnelling in from all directions, so it’s also one of the best places to hold up if you’ve got a taste for action. It’s a good thing people who like hot dropping - intentionally starting in heavily contested locations - are typically starving for high-intensity games. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-worlds-edge-fragment\">Read more</a> ",

While it is slightly trivial to look at rank distribution this early in a split, the post in question does show that the majority of players have failed to move past the first three ranks of Rookie (newly added for Season 13), Bronze 4, and Bronze 3. With the climb up the ranks clearly getting tougher, and the emphasis on placements and teamwork becoming a talking point for solo players, a lot of casual players have been quick to find fault with the new system.

Now to fulfill that mission and continue defending his home, he’ll have to prove himself a hero among Legends. In the Apex Games, Newcastle can use his Knockdown Shield to protect his squadmate as he revives them, and even drag them out of harm’s way. He can charge into the fray with a Mobile Shield, blocking weapon damage and deflecting grenades, while his Ultimate erects a fortified Castle Wall. PASSIVE: RETRIEVE THE WOUNDED Drag allies as you revive and protect them with your Revive Shield. TACTICAL: MOBILE SHIELD Throw a controllable drone that creates a moving energy shield.

We added a brand-new POI; a washed-up sea creature known as the Downed Beast—which is a unique combat experience for Apex Legends—an organic combat zone, and a refreshing change from man-made architecture. On top of that, we added a brand new PvE feature, IMC Armories, at four strategic locations around the map which can dynamically change the championship outcome. Be wary here, you will encounter waves of Spectres but if you survive you can earn sweet loot tailored to your loadout. Check out all the details in our Storm Point Update Blog by Senior Level Designer, Keith Jensen. MAP ROTATION The map rotation for the season for Saviors will be Storm Point, Olympus, and World’s Edge. We’re also removing the longer 2-hour rotation block. We felt that could be too long considering it could span the whole play session for some people. RANKED RELOADED Apex Legends: Saviors’ upgraded Ranked system adds tier demotions, entry cost adjustments,, and a rework of Ranked Points to promote teamplay. The current Ranked goals revolve around Teamplay for Victory, and Accurate Skill & Better Competition. We are making a large number of changes that focus on these two core pillars, with the outcome that players will focus on playing as a team and playing for the win, and RP will be a more accurate representation of your overall game skill.

So, let's start with those weapon changes shall we? Nine weapons are getting their base stats tweaked in Apex Legends Season 13, most of which are nerfs. The headline changes are the nerfs coming to all four of the battle royale's light machine guns (the Spitfire, L-STAR, Rampage, and Devotion) and to the game's god-like Kraber sniper rifle. The Kraber has had its headshot multiplier slashed, and when coupled with a headshot protection buff to blue and purple helmets, your one-shot Kraber kills are gonna get a whole lot harder. Shotguns are also getting tinkered in Season 13, with the Peacekeeper and Mozambique getting small buffs, while the Mastiff (which is this season's crate weapon) also getting some balance changes.

Ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 13 release date</a>, we have a good idea of what to expect when it comes to Newcastle's kit, but did you know that he also has a secret second passive ability? Speaking to The Loadout, senior game designer Devan McGuire was kind enough to reveal that Newcastle actually has something of a second passive ability - something that makes him even more effective at protecting his team... and himself. When we asked McGuire about Newcastle's passive ability and its relation to his Knockdown Shield, he revealed that \"Newcastle has a secret passive that allows him to revive - or recharge - his Knockdown Shields\" while out of combat. Why is this a big deal? Well, at the moment, a Knockdown Shield is only recharged when the player using it is no longer down - whether that is them being revived, or them being killed. However, Newcastle is going to be the only legend who actively uses his Knockdown Shield while alive - through his Retrieve the Wounded passive. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-newcastle-second-passive\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-map-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 13 map changes add loot hotspot to Storm Point</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 13 release date - when does Saviors come out?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - Ranked Reloaded, splits, and Season 13 explained</a> ",

The one feature that excites us, though, is Storm Point's new IMC Armories. Home to <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/smart-supply-bins\">Apex Legends' Smart Supply Bins</a>, these locations are going to be an important part in getting the best loot while playing on Storm Point. However, getting your hands on this loot isn't going to be as easy as fighting a few waves of Spectres. Speaking to The Loadout, senior game designer Samantha Kalman has revealed that IMC Armories are \"one use per game\". Yes, you're reading that right - and we heard it right, too. Apex Legends players will only be able to activate and use Storm Point's new IMC Armories once per game - and with there only being four of these dotted around the map at launch, it's not going to be easy to jump in and reap the rewards unbothered. Explaining Respawn Entertainment's decision to limit the use of an IMC Armory to once per game, Kalman expressed that the development team had to consider \"what if the ring closes near \" and how they would affect the latter stages of a game. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-map-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 13 map changes add loot hotspot to Storm Point</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 13 release date - when does Saviors come out?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - Ranked Reloaded, splits, and Season 13 explained</a> ",

Fans want to know what-exactly drew the monstrous sea creature to shore and what implications this has for the future. So, ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 13 release date</a>, we asked Respawn Entertainment what exactly drew the Downed Beast to Storm Point - and the answer wasn't what we expected. In the opening moments of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOFuEQEvC3E&t=50s\">Apex Legends Saviors Gameplay Trailer</a>, the narrator expresses that \"we may never have the answers\" to burning questions like \"where did the creature come from\" and \"why did it attack\". However, speaking to The Loadout, gameplay director Steve Ferreira has revealed that the giant sea monster was drawn to Storm Point by its stomach and the hunt for \"tasty leviathans\". We know that sounds hard to believe, but that's the answer we got - and it makes sense when you look at the teasers Respawn Entertainment released in the build-up to the reveal of Apex Legends' Saviors update. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/downed-beast-storm-point\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-newcastle-second-passive\">Apex Legends Season 13's Newcastle has a secret second passive</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - Ranked Reloaded, splits, and Season 13 explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Apex Legends' Season 13 Storm Point IMC Armories are one-use per game</a> ",

One thing that seems to be missing from Respawn Entertainment's plans, though, is limited-time modes (also known as LTMs). Fear not, though, Apex Legends players - speaking to The Loadout, game director Steve Ferreira has revealed that LTMs are still very-much the focus for the developer - and a fan-favourite LTM is going to return in the second half of the Saviors season! When asked about Respawn's plans for Apex Legends LTMs in Season 13 and beyond, Ferreira explained that \"something are going to see is the continued addition of LTMs\" and \"remixes of past LTMs\". Elaborating further on this point, he expressed that one \"focus of the team right now\" is \"trying out and experimenting a few different things and ways to play\" through past Apex Legends' LTMs. So, while we might not be getting anything drastically new in the future, players can still expect new experiences from Apex Legends going forward. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ltm-remix-control\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - Ranked Reloaded, splits, and Season 13 explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Apex Legends' Season 13 Storm Point IMC Armories are one-use per game</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/downed-beast-storm-point\">Apex Legends devs reveal what drew the Downed Beast to Storm Point</a> ",

There's nothing worse than being on the cusp of victory to find yourself being shot in the back by an unseen assailant. Apex Legends does give you ways to combat this - Gibby's dome shield is a particularly useful tool to have - but it's largely a fact of life that, at some point, you're going to be third-partied. Well, until now. Speaking to press, Samantha Kalman, senior game designer at Respawn Entertainment, has revealed that Storm Point's IMC Armory locations are actually going to be third-party proof. We know that this is hard to believe, but it's true. When you head into one of Storm Point's four IMC Armory locations to loot, \"you're protected from being third-partied\", according to Kalman. However, this comes at a cost - as you might expect. Players looking to loot these locations are going to have to lock themselves in and weather an intense minute-long storm of close-quarters combat with waves of deadly Spectres - automated infantry robots you may recognise from Titanfall. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/imc-armory-third-party\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Apex Legends' Season 13 Storm Point IMC Armories are one-use per game</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/downed-beast-storm-point\">Apex Legends devs reveal what drew the Downed Beast to Storm Point</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ltm-remix-control\">Apex Legends looking to \"remix\" LTMs like Control for future seasons</a> ",

Right on the workbench you can see that bracelet that popped up in the trailer, seemingly an item of value to Newcastle.

The new season, titled <strong>Saviors</strong>, seems to be coming with monstrous changes to Storm Point as that’s where the events of the trailer takes place. However, while an altered map is in the background, <strong>Newcastle</strong> takes centre stage as the star of the video and the 21st character to join the Apex Legends roster. While we don’t know exactly what the character can do in game at this point, certain info can be ascertained from the trailer which we’ve embedded below. We’ll start by focusing on what we can see Newcastle doing combat-wise, rather than the narrative info revealed. Newcastle seems to be able to throw out a front-facing barrier in front of him, which provides additional cover for his teammates. In fact, much of what they do in this trailer revolves around blocking attacks, be it shots from nearby robots or giant laser beams. It’s hard to differentiate cinematic flavour from actual abilities, but it’s clear that they’ll be a defensive Legend. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-saviors-newcastle-cinematic-trailer\">Read more</a> ",

Yes, Newcastle - who's whole kit was leaked several weeks ago in one of the largest Apex Legends leaks we've seen so far - is indeed the next character to jump into the fight on Storm Point and beyond. On April 25, Respawn Entertainment released the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cheYIVEtVQ4\">Saviors Launch Trailer</a> - the official name of Season 13 - and offered fans an exciting first look at Newcastle in action.

This mode isn't easy, replacing all healing items with several healing zones at fixed points across the map. If you're struggling with the lack of healing on offer, we suggest switching out to Revenant for a while. Why? One Reddit user has discovered an Apex Legends Revenant glitch that allows him to heal, while being invulnerable, in Flashpoint. '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/u7vq5y/revenant_can_heal_while_in_death_protection_in/\">RossBobSquirrel</a>', a Redditor known for uncovering exploits and Easter eggs in Apex Legends, has shared a clip confirming that Revenant can heal in a Flashpoint Zone during a match of Flashpoint while benefiting from the Death Protection bonus you get from using his Death Totem ultimate ability. Why is this a big deal? Well, usually, players with this Death Protection buff active can't use any healing items and, when they die, they are returned to the Death Totem with a maximum of 50 health. With the constant healing of a Flashpoint Zone, it's clear to see why this would make winning a fight with a Revenant and his squad with Death Protection near-impossible. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/revenant-glitch-flashpoint\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-ranked-changes\">Apex Legends \"reworked ranked system\" coming in Season 13</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-character-reveal\">Apex Legends' Season 13 character confirmed in latest cinematic</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-teasers\">Apex Legends Season 13 teasers hint at arrival of huge sea monster</a> ",

This all happened within the course of 24 hours, and stands to make reaching events far more realistic for some of the worlds best players. Previously, only the top five teams from APAC North, NA, and EMEA had their costs covered by the publishers of Apex Legends, as well as just the top 2 teams from APAC South and SA. This, as you can imagine, put additional financial stress on certain teams who until this change in policy were going to have to fund the trip to Stockholm Sweden for the April 29 Split 2 playoffs. For teams based whole continents away, being expected to pay for their entire team plus coaching staff would have burnt a significant hole in their pocket. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-pro-player-travel-costs\">Read more</a> ",

However, fans are certain that Newcastle (the most visually finished legend in the leaks) is going to be the next new face we see in the Apex Games. <a href=\"https://charlieintel.com/huge-apex-legends-leak-reveals-unreleased-newcastle-legend-gameplay-more/167778/\">Charlie Intel</a>, the outlet that first spotted the leaks online, doubles down on the idea citing Newcastle's \"fleshed out\" animations and textures as evidence that he's next. Looking at his leaked abilities, he can't come soon enough. Newcastle could be the next support legend that Apex desperately needs. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/newcastle-character-leaks\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/drop-off-arena-map\">Apex Legends' Warriors collection event drops off brand new Arena map</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/character-leaks\">Apex Legends character leaks - here's who could join the Apex Games</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/interview-steve-ferreira-evan-nikolich\">Respawn discusses Apex Legends' past, present, and future</a> ",

To commemorate its achievements, look at its shortcomings, and also gaze ahead to the future of Apex Legends, The Loadout picked the brains of two people with plenty of insight on the game and its journey ahead: game director Steve Ferreira, and design director, Evan Nikolich. In this lengthy interview, Ferreira and Nikolich discuss reaching that coveted 100 million players milestone, bringing Apex to mobile and next-gen consoles, high-profile departures at Respawn, and the future of the Titanfall universe and Apex Legends' role within it. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/interview-steve-ferreira-evan-nikolich\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/titanfall-universe\">Apex Legends team \"passionate\" about Titanfall experiences</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-upgrade-dualsense\">Apex Legends PS5 DualSense capabilities a \"core feature\" for next-gen</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/100-million-players\">Apex Legends hitting 100 million players was a \"memorable moment\"</a> ",

This includes whether those on the PS5 will be able to use the DualSense controller's features while playing Apex Legends. However, in a wide-ranging interview with The Loadout discussing the past, present, and future of Apex Legends, game director Steve Ferreira suggests that such DualSense features will be arriving in the battle royale at some stage. \"Like I've mentioned in previous interviews, we plan to continually add new features to our next-gen platforms,\" Ferreira says. \"While I can't confirm today when we will see DualSense features come to Apex, I can say that yes, it's one of the core features that really adds to the feel of the game and is something very core to all Respawn games.

Reversing the flow of gravity, this ability lifts players 30 metres off the ground and throws them out into the air - which can be useful in both offensive and defensive situations. In its current form, Gravity Lift only pushes players up - however, that wasn't always the case. Apex Legends' lead software engineer, Chris Winder, has revealed that Respawn previously attempted to have Gravity Lift work in every direction. In a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/t87cm5/name_your_main_and_i_will_reply_with_a_buffnerf/hznlait/?context=1000\">Reddit post</a> discussing legend buffs and nerfs, 'mufasakong' suggests a Horizon buff that would allow players to \"attach to any surface\", which would push players in the direction the tactical is facing. Responding to this, 'RV-GameplayChris' - who we identified as Winder - reveals that Respawn actually tried this while developing Horizon and her kit. \"We tried this! It was crazy! And unpredictable\", Winder says. However, it was simply \"not that fun\" when you take into account just how varied the terrain is in Apex Legends' maps. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-gravity-lift-scrapped-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/steam-player-count-february-2022\">Apex Legends Steam player count skyrockets to all-time high</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked - ranks, splits, and Season 12 scoring explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list - the best guns in the battle royale game</a> ",

Let’s check it out. REWARD TRACKER This year we’re featuring a reward track filled with 12 community-created cosmetics and more, totaling 24 event-limited skins that players can earn during the event. Check out some of the cosmetics you can earn below including some Legendary Squad Skins created based off fan favorites from the past. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/0c627b2f16f40a31c99216b981853930907b0724.jpg Special thanks to the following creators who contributed to the tracker: Akka_0510, BadgerBitten, Bamwoozle, Cryophase, FrAgMenTIx, Hunnypuzzle, iiTzTimmy, Iwamoto_05, LilakeyLK, Lululuvely, Lumenzampel, MacksArts, PreetiSketch, Ryonello, ShibuyaHal, StylishNoob4, The Gaming Merchant, Wisethug.

Upon unlocking tier 1 of a Prestige Skin, a player will be able to complete challenges to unlock Tier 2 and Tier 3 at no additional cost. Players will have an unlimited amount of time to complete these challenges once available. Once a Prestige Skin Tier’s challenge is completed a player will unlock that respective tier’s version of the Legend skin which can then be equipped. Players have the ability to equip any unlocked tier of a Prestige Skin once owned. Example: A player unlocks Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin. In order to unlock Tier 2 Bloodhound Prestige Skin, a player must complete the following challenge: Deal 30,000 damage with Bloodhound. The challenge begins the moment Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin is unlocked. Once a player unlocks Tier 2 Bloodhound Prestige Skin, they will then be eligible to start the challenge for Tier 3 Bloodhound Prestige Skin: Deal 70,000 additional damage with Bloodhound. Once Tier 3 Bloodhound Prestige Skin challenge is completed the player will unlock Tier 3 Bloodhound Prestige Skin, which not only looks great but also comes with a special finisher called, “Piercing Plasma”. After the 3rd Anniversary Collection Event ends, the Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin will become available in the Mythics Shop for 150 Heirloom shards. SQUAD SKINS {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/67e9f1c1da1c3da3dcc74008baccdca6ee78115e.png Also during the event, you’ll be able to purchase Legendary Squad Skins that are themed based on some fan favorites from the past. For example, during the event we’ll have Squad Skins inspired by Crypto’s “Hypebeast”, Caustic’s “Blackheart”, skins, and more! All 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Anniversary Collection Event Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you’ll unlock the Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin (Apex Hunter).

        "contents": "<strong>February 23, 2022</strong> Respawn has issued a fix for the Bloodhound prestige skin challenge reset. The headline and copy has been updated to reflect this. Apex Legends' Anniversary collection event kicked off earlier this week, but it's not all happy celebrations for Bloodhound players - despite the fact that they have a new mythic-rarity skin to unlock. The skin's high value of around $160 is dividing fans on its own, but there are also reports that the skin's challenge tracking is broken. Thankfully, this issue has been quickly addressed by Respawn Entertainment. Bloodhound's new Apex Hunter skin has three tiers of challenges for players to unlock, each offering a different take on the skin's core design. Tier 1 can be unlocked by completing the Anniversary collection event - the same way you would be able to unlock an heirloom item. Tier 2 and Tier 3, however, are unlocked through in-game challenges. This skin's challenges are all about dealing damage while playing as Bloodhound. This sounds straightforward, but a lot of players are struggling to actually complete the challenge. There are multiple reports of the challenge tracking being broken. Cloud9's Paris <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StayNaughtyy/status/1493735035232526339\">'StayNaughty'</a> Gouzoulis tweeted their challenge tracker being stuck at \"-1/-1\" - a clear issue. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bloodhound-prestige-skin-broken\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/post-malone-iitztimmy-duos\">Post Malone and Apex Legends streamer iiTzTimmy to team up on Twitch</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/abilities-destroy-wraith-portals\">Apex Legends players discover more ways to destroy Wraith portals</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/shroud\">Shroud is \"over\" the Apex Legends battle pass</a> ",

BRAND NEW LIMITED-TIME MODE: CONTROL Defiance kicks off with Control, a brand-new limited-time mode that delivers an adrenaline-fueled 9v9 experience where two teams fight to capture and control points on the map. Featuring the largest team sizes in Apex Legends to date, players will pre-select their loadouts, drop in, and for the first time ever have the opportunity to experience the rush of having the same Legends fighting side by side, creating thrilling moments that can only happen in Control. In this mode, death is not the end, as throughout the match players will be able to respawn and carry on the fight until one team earns enough points to be declared the winner. So get ready to experience the spectacle of 9v9 Legend combat when Control kicks off on February 8th. GET REWARDS TO KICKOFF THE SEASON To celebrate the 3rd Anniversary and the amazing community of Apex Legends, we’re giving away rewards to all players who log in during the first three weeks of Defiance.* From February 8 to February 15, all players will unlock three Octane thematic packs just for logging in; if players don’t already have him, he’ll automatically be unlocked.

The lengthy patch notes go over most of the already-revealed changes and additions in detail - such as balancing <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-legend-changes\">tweaks to Caustic and Crypto</a>, a new hop up, and <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/defiance-map-changes\">Olympus' map changes</a> - but there are also some new bits of information too. One of the most eye-catching changes involves the latest map to be added to Apex Legends, Storm Point. While most players have been relatively happy with the map, its experimental PvE wildlife mechanic has had its critics - particularly regarding the Prowlers that stalk the map. In Season 12, the Prowlers are getting a general nerf that will make them less frustrating to come up against, and will also become more lucrative to defeat if you choose to do so. You will now get 150 Crafting Material by completing standard Prowler nests, 250 for clearing the larger nest in the centre of the map, and high-tier loot will drop slightly more often from all wildlife in Season 12. Players will also be happy to learn that they cannot be completely swarmed by Prowlers any more - only three can lock on to an individual player at a time. They'll also no longer engage you when you're outside of the ring and scrambling for safety - that is unless you engage them first. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-prowler-nerfs-storm-point\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bad-player-data-error-fix\">Apex Legends bad player data error - how to fix this issue</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-rating\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S ratings have surfaced</a> ",

This tidbit came alongside a slew of information regarding the game following a Q&A section for the Defiance update. In this preview event, aspects of Mad Maggie’s character, the team's journey from the initial launch of Apex Legends to this latest season three years later, and the revelation of next gen versions being in the works were all discussed. On the topic of Mad Maggie, it was revealed that her abilities were originally planned for a polish Legend called Hasaria, a SWAT-style legend that didn’t quite make the cut for the current game. The actual character of Mad Maggie has been in the works for some time as a foil to Fuse, someone able to outshoot the Aussie legend in a rivalry very much built on the foundation created with Loba and Revenant. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-next-gen-version\">Read more</a> ",

During a media event, game engineer Chris Winder reveals that elements of Maggie's kit were originally made for a legend that would resemble a \"Polish winged hussar\" - horse-mounted soldiers defined by large plumages of feathers on their armour - called Husaria. Describing her as a \"one-woman SWAT team\", Husaria was originally designed to be a \"breacher\" - someone who can take defensive legends to task and push fortified squads. It's clear that Maggie's kit is preserving the essence of this character, but Wilder reveals that there were quite a few iterations of this \"breacher\" before Maggie's kit was settled on. Respawn was aware that creating a balanced character was important - Apex Legends has a lot of \"open ground\" in-between its buildings - and this led to the design team testing a number of abilities. Winder reveals a \"riot shield, a flashbang, and even at one point, a shotgun attached to her leg\" were considered. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/maggie-legend-development\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-rating\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S ratings have surfaced</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in Season 12</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-prowler-nerfs-storm-point\">Apex Legends Season 12 will nerf Storm Point's pesky Prowlers</a> ",

In Control, the nine-legend squads are essentially made up of three traditional Apex trios - and yes, that means you can't nine-stack. In the mode, players can freely swap which legend they play as after death while waiting to be respawned, so you aren't tied down to just one character per match. In trailer footage for Control, we saw a few instances where two of the same legend were competing on the same team, confirming you do not need nine unique legends on a team. However, Respawn hasn't explicitly stated just how many of the same legend each team can have. Could we in theory see nine Pathfinders versus nine Caustics? Is two the maximum, as we saw in trailers? Or, as many have assumed so far, might we be able to have three of the same legend, with each trio being allowed to have one each? <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-teams\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-rating\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S ratings have surfaced</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in Season 12</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-prowler-nerfs-storm-point\">Apex Legends Season 12 will nerf Storm Point's pesky Prowlers</a> ",

With two new POIs, Phase Driver and Terminal, and an expanded playable area on the south side of the map, Olympus is going to be bigger and better than ever before. Terminal is being introduced to offer a new route into Hammond Labs from Bonsai Plaza and several minor changes have been made throughout the map to help with rotation into - and more importantly out of - choke points.

Well, for two of the battle royale's most frustrating legends, their time under the microscope is now. During a media event, balance designer John Larson reveals that the two legends getting tweaked for Apex Legends Season 12 are Caustic and Crypto. Caustic is receiving a nerf that will make his Nox Gas Traps a bit less formidable, while Crypto mains will receive a new way to use his surveillance drones. So, let's take a look at Caustic first. In previous seasons, the legend's notoriously annoying gas traps could only be destroyed before they detonated. However, players can now destroy them after they've been triggered, which means no matter how sneakily you conceal your gas trap, it can still be removed and the onslaught of gas can be halted. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-legend-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/maggie-legend-development\">Apex Legends' Maggie stole abilities designed for another legend</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-version-news\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S update news coming \"very, very soon\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-teams\">Apex Legends Control teams can have up to three of the same legend</a> ",

This information comes from a developer Q&A where game designer David Sweiczko filled us in on many of the details. Here are the basics. Control is a 9v9 mode, where teams fight to control three locations on the map. As time progresses these locations controlled by teams provide points.

But that’s not all we’re bringing for the Holidays, how about the return of one of our favorite limited-time modes, Winter Express! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/113ff434f3716adf6fa09df57f829282d65575a0.png CHOO CHOO! ALL ABOARD THE WINTER EXPRESS! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/b67858872c5b1adfd4b16bedece25c75ab237a88.png That’s right: Winter Express returns! This beloved game mode offers three squads the opportunity to board and capture the World’s Edge train. For the first time, Legends will be able to pick their loadout before boarding the train; play around and find the best loadout for you! RAIDERS COLLECTION EVENT {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/5e4afaa4cfd83a095ee3d2c1eb08f6179874c56b.jpg Each Legendary skin has a complementary weapon, either in the collection or the prize track. You can earn 1,600 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/61f36c821a268d7ff3572d14142befa4a800311d.jpg All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete several at once. And of course, the Raiders Collection Event also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, limited-time cosmetics. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/0a29783499e04d4afef6746f42c27db4935c6ffb.gif WATTSON HEIRLOOM Once you unlock all 24 collectibles, you’ll receive Wattson’s electric Heirloom, the “Energy Reader”! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/8ef78834f171a21a13cde397379f07552d4a04eb.gif PATCH NOTES LEGENDS Wattson: Fixed the issue with fences “sticking” when trying to place a node near a fence. Wattson: Fixed bug for cases where Wattson’s Fence nodes ignored player collision. Wattson: Fixed bug with the blueprint line not showing up to signify where the fence will be created. Wattson: Fixed issue where Caustic’s Ultimate isn’t zapped by the Interception Pylon. Wattson: Fixed bug where Arc Stars could stick to and damage the Interception Pylon Ash: Based on feedback we’ve increased the audio presence of Ash’s Ultimate. Ash will no longer “bleed” when shot and now displays sparks . Ash: fixed cases where a grid pattern would show on some rare and common skins. Valkyrie / Revenant: Fixed a bug where using a Skydive with Death Totem at a specific time caused Valkyrie’s skydive to enter a bugged state. Valkyrie: Fix for Birthright Skin where Valk’s jetpack control clips into her hands in first person. ARENAS Arenas: Fixed bug where Seer could continuously charge his tactical after it’s reached zero uses. Arenas: Reduced reconnect times since the matches are shorter than a Battle Royale match. Arenas: Fix for missing ammo UI on the common, rare, or epic, CAR. Arenas: Fix for missing horizontal black bars while spectating. Arenas: Fix for cases where the Death Tab is missing from the shop window. ADDITIONAL BUG FIXES Fixed issue with a spot on Storm Point where players could camp in unintended areas near Command Center. We also addressed multiple minor bugs around the map ranging from misplaced kill triggers and holes in geo. Bocek Compound Fracture Legendary skin bug: Fixed an issue where players would still see iron sights when aiming even if another sight is equipped. R-301 Dynastic Cycle Legendary skin bug: Fixed an issue with the gun using a mix of two different skins. Fixed bug for cases where the Loba Edition displays “No Price Found” when viewed in the store tab. Based on feedback we’ve reduced the SFX on reactive skins for the Volt. Fixed bug where players were unable to scroll downwards when looting a death box or black market. Fixed bug that was preventing players from getting Rampart’s Heirloom even after buying all 24 event packs. Fixed bug where players could skydive faster after spamming Ping. Fixed issue with players seeing the 888 Elite Mode Badge constantly unlocking. BALANCE CHANGES Seer Decreased Focus of Attention detonation delay from 1.6s to 1.4s Dev Note: Seer was dialed back to a healthier spot with the balance hotfix soon after his release. However, after four months of evaluating his use in the live game, the detonation delay seems a little too sluggish. We want to improve its feel while continuing to evaluate the reveal meta as a whole. Arc Star Sticks Base stick damage lowered from 30 -> 10 Shield Damage Multiplier increased from x3 -> x4 (stick on shielded enemy will now max out at 40 instead of 90) Sticking an enemy now applies a slow debuff (reverting Legacy update change) Non-Sticks Slow duration is now driven by distance to the center of Arc Star detonation Dev Note: Arc stars excel in a lot of areas. They have high damage potential coupled with a punishing slow, and can be thrown more accurately than other ordnance types. Removing the stick slow created some degenerate play patterns and often made it hard to tell when you got stuck in the heat of battle. We’re bringing that back with a tradeoff of lower damage potential and a proximity based slow falloff in non-stick cases. These changes make stick scenarios more consistent across shield types and make arc stars less effective at area denial. Splatter Rounds Removed increased magazine capacity Dev Note: Big Maude has been an awesome drop location and a reliable source of early power for teams that win the hotdrop. However, the paintball weapons are proving to be a little too strong so we’re going to remove the increased mag size but keep the handling improvements. Crafting Shotgun ammo, sniper ammo, and arrow crafting output reduced to a single stack PRIVATE MATCH Observer Mode - UI and Scoring Improvements for in-game stats menu. Observer Mode - Reduced opacity on Loba’s Back Market for map & mini-map. Observer Mode - Added toggle option to show next ring location. Added Eliminated text in kill feed for Private Match Anonymous mode. Admins now have the ability to end matches in either Observer or Player positions. Fixed issue for real time API delay after running consecutive games. New real time API events including: Shots fired Kill awarded Line by line formatting Unique player IDs QUALITY OF LIFE New Custom Reticle Color System Custom Reticles are here! The new UI can be opened under Gameplay Settings by selecting the Customize option under Reticle. Once in the new Custom Reticle UI you’ll be able to: Select a color from some of our recommended favorites Use the color and brightness sliders to find that perfect color Manually enter an RGB color Toggle between 4 different hand picked environments to preview your reticle {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/a50480bd76ac44b37f9504b04239e06560cbbab2.png Dev Note: You’ll be able to pick from a lot of colors in the new system, but darker colors won’t be selectable because of how some of our reticles react to the world (additive effect) which would make them invisible. If a manually entered RGB value is in that range, we will do our best to keep that hue but will bring that value closer to a safe color. From all of us on the Apex Legends team we wish you all a safe and wonderful Holiday! Thank you for the support this year.",

Adult movie star, plumber, doctor, construction worker, and master of numerous other trades <strong>Johnny Sins</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/qw8x1j/johnny_sins_is_banned_from_apex/\">had his name censored</a> in Apex Legends. This harrowing news was uncovered by <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/kap3\">streamer Kap3</a> and posted on Reddit, it seems like typing out the actors name with proper spacing and punctuation results in both words being blocked out. Now, chat censors are important in hugely-popular multiplayer games for obvious reasons. You can’t have words that are super offensive - such as slurs - usable in a game like Apex Legends, unless you want it to become a cesspit of toxicity. However, this specific situation is a bit of a head scratcher, since while Mr. Sins is a man enveloped in subject matter that is inherently NSFW, he’s not some Voldemort-esque figure nor a person whose name or work is particularly offensive. It seems as though he’s just been shafted. This funnily enough isn’t the first time Johnny Sins and Apex Legends have collided. Back in Season Seven, players paid the actor on Cameo (a service that allows people to pay for personalized video messages from a wide range of celebrities) to send a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp80KIqjINw\">message</a> to Respawn Entertainment urging them to add and change certain aspects of the game. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-johnny-sins-banned-name-censored-season-11\">Read more</a> ",

        "contents": "NEW CONTENT NEW LEGEND: ASH A new Legend with a familiar face, Ash has overseen the Arenas from the shadows and held a tight grip on Pathfinder’s heart. A simulacrum made from the woman who once was Dr. Ashleigh Reid, Ash is determined to eliminate every trace of weakness that held her back as a human.. Detecting death wherever she goes, spearing enemies with electric snares that lock them in place, tearing through space to take more lives-- it would be easy to think that there was nothing human left within that cold steel. But a trace of the human doctor remains, and she poses a greater threat to Ash than any Legend in the ring. Passive: Marked for Death Ash's map shows the location of recent deathboxes. She gets a special prompt on a deathbox, use it to mark surviving attackers (once per box). Tactical: Arc Snare Throw a spinning snare that damages and tethers the first enemy that gets too close. Ultimate: Phase Breach Tear open a one-way portal to a targeted location. This portal stays open for a short time, during which anyone can use it. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/52d63908ec2fed4de2a15082cbec42705e8bb097.png NEW MAP: STORM POINT This beautiful oasis was once an energy colony for the IMC, and the ruins remain. Many have tried to make a home here: all have failed. A survey of the area revealed the remains of three unique settlements built across the centuries, but no survivors. The colony lay abandoned, only visited by the occasional pirate or castaway. Now the Mercenary Syndicate has plans of their own for Storm Point. It looks so enticing, but the pristine beaches and crystal waters are just the eye of the hurricane. All around, dangers swirl: wild prowlers, venomous spiders, and the gathering storms only add to the tension in the air. Now the Legends are here to make this place their own. So it looks like Storm Point is only going to get more dangerous. Check out our blog with all the details here. BATTLE ROYALE MAP ROTATION For the Escape update the map rotation will be back down to 2 maps; Storm Point and World’s Edge. With Storm Point being a whole new map, we want to make sure players have plenty of time to master the new arena. ARENAS MAP ROTATION With the introduction of Encore, the Arenas map rotation will now include only the custom made Arenas maps. We will not be using BR locations for Arenas in the Escape update. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/51e7d2a69451c9e9b662830de769a2cd7d8dc575.png NEW WEAPON: C.A.R.

The Combat Advanced Round submachine gun is a fully automatic weapon that takes adaptability to the next level by accepting either Light or Heavy mags. The C.A.R. hits hard but handles light, this hybrid weapon’s the best of both worlds for when you’re ready to take a stand and become the most dangerous thing on the island. RANKED UPDATES Hello, Legends! Let’s take a quick look at how Ranked in Emergence shaped up and review the changes coming in Escape. Ranked continues to attract a large portion of players (around 40% of all playtime!), but this doesn’t mean we can’t look to make improvements. Note: We fixed an issue where expired skydrive trails remained accessible for longer than they should have. These trails will now expire on the intended seasonal cadence, as mentioned originally in the Ranked Series 3 post (trails from Series 1 & 2 are still grandfathered in). RANKED BATTLE ROYALE - ESCAPE “Skill” in Apex can be evaluated in all sorts of ways. It’s the amalgamation of gun skill, movement, positioning, awareness, legend mastery, and prevailing over everyone else as Champion that separates the lowly Bronze from Apex Predators. With that in mind, we want to provide more flexibility and nuance to how players can express skill when RP gains are at stake. Before Escape, measurements have been simple and straightforward. We grant RP based on kill points and a placement multiplier. Now, we’re easing back on some RP restrictions to offer other routes to max out kill-related RP in a match. TL;DR: Just give me the summary... Kill RP values now take differences between killer/victim Ranked tiers into account. The kill RP cap (as we have traditionally thought about it up to this point) is effectively being raised from six to seven. However, this kill-related RP cap can be reached in different ways, depending on tier differences and placement. Placement is still paramount, and you still must place first to have a chance at max total RP. To expand on the first point, tier differences between the killer and victim will be taken into account when calculating baseline kill point value. For example, if a Plat player kills a Diamond player, that kill counts as 12 instead of 10 RP. The maximum kill point RP is 175. Any kill-related RP that exceeds that after placement and tier modifiers are added doesn’t affect total RP. The final step is to add a flat placement bonus. Enough with the math, let’s explain these changes with an example: As a Platinum player, you party up with your Diamond friend and matchmake into a lobby with similarly skilled players. You snag second place, with 6 kills (and/or assists) against Diamond players, and 3 on Plat players. Each kill on those Diamond players is worth 12 points instead of the typical 10, because they are one rank tier higher than you. That leaves us with (12 × 6) + (10 × 3) = 102 RP. Now let’s take placement into account. In second, the per kill bonus is 10, so our 9 kills (including assists) × 10 = 90 RP. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/36b7d67bb5b8560749d3cfb651abc58f20e66aee.png We’re curious to see how these changes affect the ranked grind. Jump into Storm Point this first split and let us know how they feel. Stay tuned; this is only the start of what we have in store for Ranked improvements. RANKED ARENAS - ESCAPE We learned a lot from the first season of Ranked arenas and are eager to bring you some improvements: Arenas Ranked now has 2 splits, similar to Ranked Battle Royale Along with each new season and split, there is a soft MMR reset and new placement matches. New seasons require the usual 10 placement matches while a new split only requires 5 placement matches. Improvements have been made to matchmaking for finding similarly skilled teammates. Reduced the AP amount gained or lost from MMR differences between teams. DEV NOTE: The final calculated AP amount for a match is a factor of your current AP and MMR. It’s also influenced by the MMR differences between teams. In practice, this difference was factoring in more than we wanted. I.e. Losing a match you were slightly favored to win was giving a bigger AP loss than desired. PATCH NOTES BALANCE CHANGES: LEGENDS WATTSON Move aside Ash, this is Wattson’s season. We’re ecstatic to finally share some long-anticipated Wattson improvements! Her win rate and encounter win rate have always been above average. This could be for a multitude of reasons; her defensive playstyle correlates to higher average placements, Wattson mains are diehard loyalists, and her hitbox has been the smallest in the game ever since Lifeline’s adjustment. Regardless, much of the high-level data that we’ve shared doesn’t match perception. Play a few games as Wattson and you’ll often find yourself wanting more out of her kit. The goal of these changes is to redistribute her invisible power into the parts of her kit that shape the battlefield in a unique way. We wanted to see what changes could spark more consistency and efficacy in her kit, and ideally ground some of the difficulties surrounding the way her abilities work. We want to enable more active gameplay from Wattson players by smoothing out the rough edges in placing fences. Responsiveness tweaks, longer range, and faster cooldowns means that Wattson can much more quickly and reliably set up a defensive position, or even use her fences and pylon in the midst of open combat in a pinch. General Improved the reliability and responsiveness of placing Wattson's Tactical and Ultimate in-world objects. Wattson can place her Tactical and Ultimate objects on valid surfaces above Wattson's eye level (to a reasonable extent). General hitbox size increase, to compensate for the removal of low profile in the Legacy update. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/3df2ed217822f9268734cfe6dc3a0614dba96824.png Tactical - Perimeter Defense Increased damage on crossing a Fence by 33%. (15 to 20) Increased debuff duration on crossing a Fence by 100%. (1.5 to 3 seconds) Increased the time allowance to be hit again by a subsequent Fence effect by 100%. (0.5 to 1 second). Decreased recharge time by 50% (30 to 15 seconds). Increased placement range by 50%. Decreased the delay between Fences shutting off and reactivating after an ally passes through them by 60%. (1.0 -> 0.4 seconds) Wattson now moves at Unarmed-speed while readying/placing Fence nodes. Fence nodes can now be placed as soon as the weapon is readied, instead of waiting for the animation to finish. Ultimate - Interception Pylon The Pylon output has been significantly reworked: Reduced the number of active Pylons Wattson can place from 3 to 1. The Pylon now lasts forever (instead of timing out after 90 seconds). The Pylon now has a pool of 250 Shields that can be distributed to nearby players, instead of effectively infinite Shields. Increased the Pylon shield recharge rate by 150%, and smoothed regen rate. (2/second -> 5/second, or more accurately: 1/0.5 seconds -> 1/0.2 seconds) When a Pylon is out of Shields, it no longer recharges players' Shields, but can still zap incoming ordnance. Taking damage while regenerating Shields via the Pylon delays continued regeneration by 1 second. The UI on the ground and HUD elements now displays the amount of Shields that remain in the Pylon. Pinging a friendly Pylon will now display the percentage of Shields remaining in the Pylon. Pylon ordnance-zapping has been moderately reworked. Ordnance is now zapped when the Pylon detects that it would hit any surface within range and line of sight of the Pylon, instead of being zapped as soon as it comes within range. As a part of the changes, current issues where the Pylon doesn't reliably zap ordnance (particularly concerning airstrike abilities, and ordnance that bounced off surfaces near the Pylon) should now be addressed. BALANCE CHANGES: WEAPONS / GEAR SUPPLY DROP ROTATION This season the Triple-Take returns to floor loot and taking its place is the G7 Scout. The Scout enters the Supply Drop with its old friend the Double-Tap Trigger equipped. Triple Take - now an energy-consuming marksman * Charge time from 0.8 -> 1.1 (pre-crate value) Mag increase at all tiers (Base: 18, White: 21, Blue: 24, Purple: 27) Ammo consumed per shot increased to 3 Ammo required per shot increased to 3 HOP UPS Dual Shell - Each round loaded into the Mastiff or the 30-30 Repeater is doubled. FULLY KITTED ROTATION Added: Mastiff 30-30 Repeater, R-301, CAR, Longbow Removed: Peacekeeper, Rampage, RE-45, Flatline, and Charge Rifle EVA-8 Fire rate reduced from 2.1 to 2.0 DEV NOTE: With the reduced bolt scaling we’ve done in previous passes the EVA-8 is still performing ahead of the shotgun pack. Hitting the base fire rate should help balance out our shotgun roster. PEACEKEEPER Slightly increased pellet size Choke up time reduced from 1.5s to 1.25s Choked up shots remain tight for slightly longer when exiting ADS DEV NOTE: When the PK came out of the crate we gave it a big sweep of nerfs to make sure the floor PK wasn’t the crate monster we had all grown to know. In this pass, we swung a little hard so we’re giving it a QOL and usability pass this season. LONGBOW Damage reduced from 60 to 55 DEV NOTE: We’re walking back a recent buff to the Longbow that proved unnecessary. We wanted to give it some love due to all the recent Marksman updates but it seems the Longbow was just fine. L-STAR Reduced barrel effectiveness at all rarity tiers Significantly reduced projectile collision size Damage reduced from 18 to 17 DEV NOTE: The L-STAR has been a force to be reckoned with this season so we’re taking a big swing and hitting its projectile size and damage in an effort to bring it down a notch. G7 SCOUT Damage increased from 34 to 36 Double Tap added to Supply Drop G7 Scout DEV NOTE: With the G7 Scout entering the supply drop we’re giving it a bump to damage and adding back on the retired Double Tap to give it some extra spice. SUPPLY DROP WEAPON RATES Early game crate weapon rate increased from 25% to 50% Mid game crate weapon rate increased from 50% to 75% Late game crate weapon rate increased from 75% to 100% DEV NOTE: Pushing a supply drop in the end game and whiffing on a weapon feels pretty rough. We want to improve the reliability of getting crate weapons out of supply drops throughout all phases of the game. Don’t worry, we’re adjusting Kraber spawn rates accordingly to keep them in line. HOT ZONE GOLD LOOT RATES Increased amount of gold loot that spawns in hot zones DEV NOTE: Hot Zones can sometimes feel a bit lackluster so we’re injecting more high-tier loot into these dynamic zones to make them more enticing drop spots. CRAFTING Increased ammo from crafting: Light Ammo 20 → 60 Heavy Ammo 20 → 60 Energy Ammo 20 → 60 Shotgun Ammo 8 → 24 Arrows 16 → 48 Sniper 12 → 36 Crafting Ammo price increased from 5 to 10 per weapon Evo Armor Points from crafting increased from 100 to 150 Evo Armor Points cost increased from 45 to 50 Replaced a sniper bundle with a shotgun bundle featuring the Dual Shell ENEMY NPC UPDATES Prowler health across the game has gone up from 90 to 114 (Storm Point and World’s Edge) Prowlers on World’s Edge and Flyers on Kings Canyon now reward EVO points (25%) ... all damage done to AI now rewards progress to your EVO armor ARENAS Supply Drop Supply drop will now land outside the first ring, if possible, and land 10 seconds earlier. Purple weapons now spawn more in earlier rounds Round 1 - 3x blue -> 1x purple + 2x blue Round 2 - 1x purple + 2x blue -> 2x purple 1x blue Round 3 - 2x purple 1x blue -> 3x purple Supply drop no longer spawns blue Havoc or Devotion or gold RE-45 Weapon Price Updates Moz Blue 125 → 150 Purple 200 → 250 P2020 Blue 75 → 50 Purple 150 → 125 RE45 Base 200 → 150 White 150 → 100 Blue 250 → 200 Prowler Base 500 → 400 Blue 300 → 350 Purple 400 → 350 R99 Base 500 → 450 Blue 250 → 300 Purple 300 → 350 Hemlok Base 500 → 450 QUALITY OF LIFE UI - teammates will now show that they are self-reviving on their in-world game tags. Added VO for players to communicate they are out of ammo. Updated the Arena Map Rotation Images to show up to five maps. Updated Social Awareness Badges to unlock as default for all accounts. BUG FIXES UI/UX / Steam Only: Fixed issue where your online friends playing Apex didn’t count towards total online friends while in matches. Fixed bug for Placing a Caustic trap over a Seer Ultimate, that could result in the Ultimate being protected from taking damage. Updated Volt skin's charm placement to be moved up so that charms become more visible. Fixed bug with players losing extra Boosted Loader extra ammo if the player reloads before getting to base ammo amount. Steam: Fixed issue where if a player has a forward slash in their name, a backslash will be added right before it automatically. Legends- Retail - Hitting an enemy with Valk tactical missiles, can result in health damage even with shields equipped Fixed issue where players do not see Legend Select when starting a game in Trios and immediately advance to drop ship phase. Audio fix for cases where music starts playing in the middle of a BR match. Fixed UI error that showed that the Legendary Prowler had the \"Shotgun\" tag in the in-game info screen. Audio fix for cases where VO for map changes doubles up (plays both variants at the same time). Audio fix for Rampart Town Takeover where vending machines had no soundFX. Fixed bug where Non-Crossplay Steam friends playing Apex would show up with debug text. Removed the random rock floating in midair in World's Edge. Bug fix for cases where a player could stand up and jump in a knocked-down state after an enemy starts finisher and cancels it. Fixed bug where player names would be missing from Legend select. Reduced hitbox size for Crafting Material Canisters to better fit its shape. Legends Rampart Fix for cases where Rampart's \"No Mercy\" finisher causes her to clip through geometry. Wattson Fixed issue where her Ultimate doesn't always destroy frag grenades when thrown inside the Pylon radius. Pathfinder Fixed issue with players being able to create ziplines much farther than intended. Fuse Fixed bug with his Ultimate cooldown being the same with or without a gold helmet. Seer Removed ability for players to be able to bunny hop at full speed while using Passive. Octane Improvements to Jump Pad sound effects ",

However, with Storm Point, Apex's fourth map that drops with Season 11: Escape, Respawn is confident they have a competitively viable battleground on its hands. For a start, Storm Point has been designed by Rodney Reece, who created the competitive scene's current map of choice, World's Edge. While Storm Point is pushing boundaries in terms of its size and introduces a new loot mechanic in the form of wildlife, all of its innovations appear to have been made with considerations of the competitive scene in mind. Speaking to The Loadout, Reece lifts the lid on how some members of the competitive Apex community helped shape the most striking aspect of Storm Point - its verticality. \"From a competitive perspective, we knew this could be problematic,\" Reece admits. \"There were a lot of things to solve. So immediately, we did internal play tests, where we bring competitive players in. The main thing that we were looking at at the time were the negative aspects that the competitive community didn't like about it. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/storm-point-competitive\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/crossplay\">Apex Legends crossplay: how to play with friends across platforms</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked: ranks, splits, and Season 11 scoring explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 11</a> ",

As well as allowing players to dive straight into new map Storm Point in the first split of the season, players will have a revised ranked battle royale scoring system to get their heads around too. While the base principle remains the same - kills, placement bonuses, and placement scores all combine to give you an end RP score - the maths is changing somewhat for ranked Season 11. While placement points will all stay the same, Respawn is relaxing the rules on RP earned through kills and assists. Say goodbye to the six-kill cut off for RP, and say hello to a more dynamic scoring system. So how does it work? Well, for a start, the amount of RP you earn for each kill or assist will now scale depending on the rank of the opponent. If you're a Platinum-ranked player and kill a Diamond player, you will receive 12 RP, rather than the standard 10 RP.

Storm Point is the biggest and tallest map in the game - it's 15% larger than previous record holder World's Edge, and at its peak, it rises higher than the plane in Kings Canyon. But was this always the goal from the start of Storm Point's development, or did the geographical extremities occur naturally throughout the two-year development process? Rodney Reece, the lead level designer for Storm Point (and the brain behind World's Edge too) says that from the outset he wanted the fourth map to push boundaries. Speaking to The Loadout, Reece explains that he pushed for so much verticality because he knew at the start of development that the game would eventually have legends with movement-specific abilities.

Shadow lives are infinite, and your squad’s not eliminated until the last living Legend falls. Three other related bundles are returning to the Store: the Loba Banshee Bundle with her Epic “Banshee Queen” skin and matching Epic “Ready to Pounce” Prowler, the Darkside for Gibraltar, with the “Darkside” Legendary skin and “Moonlight Bash” for the EVA-8, and Bangalore’s Soldado de la Muerte bundle with Legendary “La Catrina\" and “Soldado de la Muerte” skins and the Legendary Mastiff “Boomstick”.

This update all comes with a new battle pass for players to work through as its release marks the start of a new season to the popular battle royale. Storm Point looks to be a largely distinct addition to the pre-existing map pool present in Apex Legends. As an island it of course has lovely coastal beaches around its perimeter, alongside large rocky outcroppings that cover the majority of the island. These large natural formations surround small man-made buildings and small outposts, and also appear to house dangerous local wildlife that’ll attack players when they get close. Then there’s Ash, a character who has been featured heavily in the arena game mode since season 9 and an antagonist from the previous first person shooter from Respawn Entertainment: Titanfall 2. She’s be poised as an antagonistic figure for a while now, and judging by her ominous voice-over on the new gameplay trailer it's clear she’s not done causing trouble yet. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-escape-gameplay-trailer-storm-point-ash\">Read more</a> ",

Our resident modder is showing those plonkers who’s in charge with the Rampart Town Takeover, Big Maude. Check out her mobile shop, parked between Lava City and the Geyser. It’s sure to be a popular POI for the rest of Emergence. Check out the full blog below for all the details in the update. Rampart Town Takeover - Big Maude {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/b360f6f147f2f47f7ff13fde329cca9903e1b6b4.png After a few rough starts to her previous shops, Rampart is pulling out the big guns with the mod shop of her dreams. Finally, she'll be able to show the Outlands—and Big Sister—what she's always been capable of creating. Enter Big Maude, Rampart’s custom shop (also a giant tank, what else would you expect?) located near Lava City in World’s Edge. This POI is big enough to accommodate a few teams fighting over the shop itself, and she’s also built a wonderful paintball course out front that acts as a spill off location if the drop just looks too spicy. Inside the shop, you can use collected materials to purchase Rampart’s Custom Modded Paintball Weapons from the new Vend-it Machines. These guns cost a bit, but they come fully kitted at different tiers. This should give players a reason to rotate here mid-game if their weapons just aren’t as upgraded as they’d like. As usual, be on the lookout for extra lore sprinkled around. Rampart’s shop is back open for business! Rampart Arenas Takeover {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/83890eba1f11575c2a29e2a64746659e42bdff36.png Rampart has slipped into the Arenas where she’ll be offering modded weapons at special discounts! These marked-down modded weapons replace their base version for the match, making lower tiers of that weapon unavailable. Her special deals update frequently, so be sure to check what’s available in your match and plan accordingly. Rampart’s Heirloom: Problem Solver {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/314545cc6eac066c059afb42fba94404913b2b6f.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/b948d2b296e590d23545c1f514fee0a603f0be56.jpg While the brick-and-mortar location might be in Battle Royale, Rampart’s bringing her entrepreneurship into the Arenas too in “Rampart’s Arenas Extravaganza,” with special discounts meant to inspire players to change up their usual loadouts. For all of her hard work, Rampart’s getting a “Problem Solver:” a brand-new Heirloom pipe wrench, complete with a gumball dispenser. Who could ask for anything more? Oh, well - how about an upgrade to Sheila? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/6f6dc3ec4c430bd0fc1a4650088ab1eff901d9fb.jpg Finally, unlock event-limited cosmetics for Wraith, Octane, Pathfinder, Fuse, Bangalore, Rampart, and Lifeline that give a glimpse into what our Legends could become with time and technology on their side. BALANCE CHANGES Rampart Sheila has gone mobile! Rampart will now be able to run around with Sheila out, and shoot while walking. The spin up is longer, and she only gets 1 magazine in this mode. Once Sheila is out, you can put it away and pull it back out until you run out of ammo (or hit the cooldown time). At any point, you can still place Sheila down for your teammates to use. Once placed, it has infinite reloads and acts just like the previous version. You cannot pick it back up. Dev Note: A legend based solely on a defensive position is hard to get right in Apex Legends. We think Rampart has a place as the ultimate defensive Legend, but we wanted to give her a little more ability to be reactive and push with her team. As usual, we’ll be watching to see how this plays out and will adjust accordingly! Revenant VFX (similar to the pulse on Loba ult placement) added to increase visibility for when a totem is placed nearby. Octane Reduced jump pad horizontal distance by 10% - 15%. Reduced the rate of Octane’s Stim regen from 1.5 to 1.0 hp/sec. Bloodhound When Bloodhound pings a clue from their passive, it will now show their teammates in quickchat how long ago the event took place Bocek Compound Bow Draw speed slightly reduced from 0.56 to 0.54 Arrows per brick increased from 14 to 16 Arrows per inventory stack increased from 28 to 32 Hemlok Reduced hipfire spread Hipfire resets slightly faster Dev Notes: The Hemlok’s hipfire effectiveness was reduced a few seasons ago and since then the weapon has seen a steady decline in use. Bringing back some of that hipfire strength (but not all) should help the weapon feel more consistent in close quarters without being dominant or affecting its medium-range excellence. Shatter Caps - Bocek Compound Bow Damage per pellet increased across all draw strengths Short draw damage: 4 to 6 Medium draw: 7 to 9 Full draw: 11 to 12 Shatter Caps - 30-30 Repeater ADS Strafe speed increased to shotgun strafe speed while Shatter Caps are enabled Charged pellet damage multiplier increased from 35% to 50% Dev Notes: When Shatter Caps work they feel amazing, but currently it can still feel a little punishing to swap into the mode. Increasing the damage potential and improving the CQC flow of the 30-30 should help Shatters feel a little more accessible and rewarding. L-STAR Cool-off time slightly increased Overheat lens replacement time slightly increased Rounds before overheat reduced at base and all Energy Magazine tiers - Base: 22 to 20 - White: 24 to 22 - Blue: 26 to 24 - Purple/Gold: 28 to 26 Arenas price adjustments: - Base: 500 to 600 - Blue: 300 to 250 - Purple: 400 to 350 Dev Notes: We’re nudging down the L-STAR’s core stats a bit to smooth out the power progression in what we think is a slightly more healthy top-end. We’ll keep a close eye on the L-STAR and it’s recoil as we enter the second half of Emergence. In Arenas, we’re well aware of it’s prevalence in high-level lobbies and are pricing it out of the first round. These changes essentially increase the blue cost by 50 and keep the purple price the same. If its pick rate remains unchanged, we will hotfix further adjustments. Shotguns EVA-8 and Mozambique headshot damage multiplier reduced from 1.5 to 1.25 bringing it in line with the Peacekeeper and Mastiff. Dev Notes: The EVA-8 holds a lot of power in its speed and leniency compared to its counterparts, the PK and Mastiff. It’s got the edge with fire rate and consistency so we’re shaving off some of its spike damage to even the playing field. We’re normalizing the Mozambique as well for consistency within the shotgun class and to give the P2020 some space as the more precise early game weapon. Triple Take ADS charge time decreased from 1.0 to 0.8 QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES Shortened the out-of-bounds timer from 30 seconds to 15. - Your timer should be reset after being respawned. Swapping from Red to a Gold Shield with more health no longer requires a long press. Evo Shields in deathboxes now show their health. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/70cb7bce408fc112b9bb2e71b554de162401813a.png Early Leaver Warning has been improved to help people from accidentally leaving before their party is dead. - You now need to hold the confirm button down for a small amount of time - The highlighting is different colored than other prompts to catch your attention - Red text warning showing your leaving penalty added {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c0199c58d0420e1dec8915d0537fe9fedba2f1c0.jpg Added character portraits to \"detected\" widget for recon characters. BUG FIXES UI Fixed a bug where Streamer mode wouldn’t anonymize the names on the scoreboard in Arenas mode Fixed issue for when players would randomly get un-readied while matchmaking in Ranked. Fix for Ranked Arenas: longest win streak number was incorrect for some players when viewed in the Stats screen.

Seer Increased the hitbox for Exhibit Ultimate to better match the model. Loba Loba can no longer glitch into Skyhook when using her tactical. Fix cases for when Loba’s ultimate visualfx do not appear while aiming down sites. Rampart Fixed bug that could get players stuck under the map after dismounting from Ramparts Turret on a Trident. Bangalore Fix for the times when pinging a Prowler would trigger a voice line that mentions a removed hop-up. Gibraltar Fix for cases where it appeared that Gibraltar's Ultimate caused dropped audio. Wattson Fixed a bug where Wattson would start matches with 30 fences. Valkyrie Fixed an exploit where players could get continuous missiles after exploiting Valkyrie's passive/tactical as well as use the Vtol jets infinitely. Sentinel Fix for when players would still see \"Amped\" or \"Revved up\" from Sentinel or Rampage after swapping weapons. Wingman Fix for reactive skins, “Precision Calibur” and “Attention to Detail” where part of the skins appeared stuck in place when shooting. World’s Edge Various fixes on World’s Edge cleaning up some bad collisions, exploitable hiding spots, and areas where players could get stuck. Firing Range Fix for the mysterious fire show that could appear in Firing Range and cause a crash. MISC Fix for cases where players were able to reach farther than intended when punching an enemy player. Private Match Fix - Observers should no longer get stuck on the intro screen for the duration of the match. Fix for Audio fluttering that could happen when killing someone during self-revive. Various fixes to improve overall game stability. (PC only) You’ll no longer be able to bind forward movement to the Mouse wheel on PC. This previously enabled an exaggerated movement tech known as \"Tap Strafing. See the dev note below for more context. Dev Note: Tap-Strafing and Mobility Tech Written by John “JayBiebs” Larson __ 9/13/21 UPDATE: The planned changes to tap-strafing have been delayed to a later patch. via @respawn Twitter The @playapex team has recently discovered some unexpected side effects of our planned changes to tap-strafing. It is still our intention to address some of the most egregious use-cases of tap-strafing, but for now we are delaying our planned change to a later patch. Movement is sacred in Apex. We weigh every change to these systems carefully and value feedback. After further testing, we've concluded we need to take more time to get this right to make sure related movement mechanics aren't caught in the cross-fire. __ Earlier this week, we announced our intention to “remove tap-strafing,” a decision that was met with surprise by many movement enthusiasts. Tap-strafing is a term associated with different sorts of movement, depending on who you ask. Internally, we generally use it to describe what many associate with scroll-wheel strafing. To be more explicit, this change targets multiple rapid directional commands after jumping. Movement should feel unchanged for controllers and for M&K (mouse-and-keyboard) players who hadn’t heard of the term “tap-strafe” until this week. Thanks to the work of a couple of our engineers, this is now easily tunable on the fly, and we have the ability to iterate on or even revert it completely without a client update. Our goal is to remove some of the sharpness in momentum conservation around 90°+ angles. That’s what I’m thinking of when I use the term “tap-strafe” throughout this post. Things like wall-bounce redirects back onto that same wall should feel unchanged, but movement afforded by scroll-wheel strafing will be removed. Since tap-strafing is a unique M&K mechanic, many platforms have asked about our approach to controller-specific systems like aim assist. As Apex and its players evolve, it’s only prudent for us to continue to evaluate whether or not aim assist needs adjustment. When top-level controller players say they would be alright with nerfing aim assist, we definitely take note. Players should not feel forced to use a specific input type to stay competitive When people say, “Gee dang it, Respawn’s balancing decisions cater to controller players,” the best answer I have is: “When it comes to accessibility, we often must consider controller players given the constraints compared to M&K. But, accessibility isn’t the same as balance design, and it’s a strawman argument to treat it as such.” This is why we believe tap-strafing exists solely as a design problem. Even in a M&K-only Apex world, or a scenario where controller and M&K could tap-strafe just the same, we don’t believe it would be a healthy change with the freedom it currently allows, for three main reasons: The first issue: it’s highly inaccessible. By “inaccessible,” we mean that it’s an opaque technique that’s practically impossible to learn organically (and the most egregious examples require a strange keybind). Secondly, tap-strafes have terrible readability and limited counter play. Path grapples and Octane pads aside, I’ve seen clips of players breaking ankles with victims (including high-skill players) who are at a loss for what to do. While it’s not terribly prevalent, I’m concerned about how this could continue to evolve as more players adapt and further develop their tap-strafe mechanics. The third point, and the most problematic, is how tap-strafing is exacerbated by movement abilities. I can buy that a tap-strafe at normal velocity in a gunfight occurs infrequently and is relatively mild enough to not immediately kill with fire. But Path grappling past and tap-strafing back into your face with a Mastiff, or Octane cranking 90s while maintaining ridiculous speed both bring up greater gameplay concerns. Mobility creep is something to be very mindful of in this game. While many love the freedom that Apex’s movement system affords, constraints are just as important. It’s not surprising that mobility legends are highly popular. Why don’t we just do more of that? Well, over time (and I’d say we are already seeing it) mobility creep can open up a Pandora's box of new problems to solve. How is third partying affected by mobility? Within a fight, how are frontlines defined? How quickly can I close the gap on an enemy? As a game, Apex is designed to work well with a finite number of movement possibilities. I feel it’s important to note that limitations don’t always equate to lowering skill-gaps; there are skill-gaps in working within constraints. One could argue that bunny-hop healing lowered the skill-ceiling—players could make up for misplays with less constraints on their ability to safely heal. Different types of skill expression are changed when we touch something like perfect air control, for better or for worse. Hopefully this provided some context, and as always, we’re happy to hear your thoughts. ",

The movement mechanic, which allowed PC players to make sharp and immediate turns mid-air to bamboozle opponents, has been at the centre of a debate after Respawn announced that it would be patching out the mechanic in an imminent update. While the dust has settled on the tap-strafing debate, Respawn has today announced that it will not be removing tap-strafing as soon as it had hoped. The developer says it has encountered \"unexpected side effects\" when testing its fix for tap-strafing, and says it is \"delaying its planned change to a later patch\". It appears that in trying to remove tap-strafing, other existing balanced and legitimate movement mechanics were being impacted. With Respawn describing movement as \"sacred\" in Apex Legends, it doesn't want to cause any collateral damage with this tap-strafing patch. \"After further testing, we've concluded we need to take more time to get this right to make sure related movement mechanics aren't caught in the cross-fire,\" Respawn explains. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tap-strafing-patch-delayed\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/server-issues\">Apex Legends players tell EA \"fix your damn servers\" as issues persist</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/halloween-event-2021-skins-start-date-game-mode\">Apex Legends Halloween event 2021: start date, skins, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/rampart-pick-rate-season-10\">Rampart's pick rate now higher than Seer's in Apex Legends Season 10</a> ",

Well, an Apex Legends player has found a new glitch that can give you much longer ziplines once again. While it's nowhere near as broken as the original Pathfinder bug, Apex Legends player 'RossBobSquirrel' has found a new method to making extra long ziplines. Pathfinder ziplines are limited to a maximum length of 100 metres, however this RossBobSquirrel claims that this trick can more than double that. In his video below, he manages to create a 230 metre zipline that spans from Fragment East to Fragment West on World's Edge. So how do you do it? Well, first you have to pop your ultimate and hover the placement indicator over an eligible spot (i.e. within the 100 metre limit). Then, cancel your ultimate, and begin running further away from that point in a straight line. Be sure that you can still see the spot where you had your placement indicator and that there isn't anything obstructing your line. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pathfinder-zipline-bug-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tap-strafing-patch-delayed\">Apex Legends tap-strafing removal pushed back for further testing</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in Season 10</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/apex-legends-global-series/commissioner-year-2-launch\">Apex Legends Global Series prepares to kick off for Year 2</a> ",

The biggest tweaks come to Fuse and Caustic to help make their kits more useful, plus it's time to say goodbye to the Spitfire LMG as it swaps places with the Prowler SMG in the game's supply drops. Finally, my favourite gun will be available on the floor again and… oh no, they've nerfed the Prowler and done away with the Select Fire hop up. Respawn, why? <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-fuse-gets-a-tracker-like-buff-next-season\">Read more</a> ",

        "contents": "APEX LEGENDS: EMERGENCE DEVSTREAM Join some of the designers behind the Emergence update as we break down the new Legend, Weapon, Map Updates, Ranked Arenas, and more! NEW CONTENT NEW LEGEND - SEER With microdrones and an artist's eye, Seer spots opportunities that other Legends might miss and seizes them in the most beautiful way he can. Check out his kit in action below. Passive - Heart Seeker Visualize and hear the heartbeats of nearby enemies when aiming down sights to get a clue to their location. Seer is able to “ADS” even while not holding a weapon. Tactical - Focus of Attention Summon microdrones to emit a focused, delayed blast that goes through walls, revealing enemies (and their health bars!), plus interrupting their actions. Ultimate - Exhibit Create a sphere of microdrones that reveal the footsteps of enemies moving quickly or firing their weapons within. Class Passive: Recon Scanning survey beacons reveals the next circle’s location. MAP UPDATE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/653b97a4f0f27593ca34a69c6c8e39c970c6a41f.jpg After months of aggressive mining by the Harvester on World's Edge, the land is overmined, overburdened, and pushed to its limit. The earth has fractured and erupted as nature is reclaiming what’s hers. Hammond is scrambling to contain the damage they’ve caused using weather-controlling machines: the Climatizer rapidly cools the surrounding area to subzero temperatures, and a Lava Siphon stabilizes the caldera. Fight for control of the always-moving gondolas in Climatizer and Lava Siphon, traverse the bubbling hot lava with caution, and show everyone what Legends are made of! Read more on the map changes in this blog post. NEW WEAPON - RAMPAGE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/88a3e281c9d673892e16af66110c11c03d152984.jpg Rampart’s latest creation, the Rampage LMG, blasts onto the scene and has absolutely no chill. This high-powered heavy ammo LMG takes its time but packs one hell of a punch. The Rampage excels at mid-range combat but struggles up close with a slower fire rate. Not one for just accepting weakness, Rampart managed to modify the Rampage’s internal combustion mechanism with, what else? Thermite! Loading a thermite grenade into the Rampage’s special chamber overclocks the fire rate and lets Legends go on a, well... rampage! RANKED ARENAS {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/e86250fddd77b85b8151c30eb33d6eeae2f953ab.jpg With the launch of the Emergence update, we’re introducing Ranked Arenas! You begin your journey through Ranked Arenas in 10 placement matches where your performance will determine your initial Match Marking Rank (MMR) and your starting rank. MMR variance is wider initially, so your first 10 matches might be stomp-or-get-stomped until your MMR defines your placement. Arenas is a head-to-head fight between two teams of three, so awarding Ranked Arenas Points is more cut-and-dry than in the 20 team Battle Royale. This means there is no entry cost and no AP for kills. Everything comes down to getting the win. That’s just the high level of how ranked arenas work. To learn more details on how Ranked Arenas will work check out our blog here. QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES Added a new badge: Win Streak. Can you get 2, 3, 4, or 5 wins in a row? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/ef0449ad8dbf8807395bf42981716505027adbac.jpg Added a “Hold On” response to enemy pings. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/88a708e58eaddc1b8135bb9a333d9a971fa89c8f.jpg Added distinct sound effects to the Gold Backpack’s revive. VFX were added in the Chaos Theory update. This gives additional feedback when players are close to but not in line-of-sight of revives. Updated the Heirloom store to give players a better view of all the items related to that item. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/62c77bfc49d29605efc8e31e92b045a8c6b0b368.png Updated Open Pack Button to show how many packs of each type are available to open. Highlighting the button shows a complete breakdown. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d11daccfdcd3486c22f024889640d10d4aa1c831.png Private Match Added Admin Toggle Option for Aim Assist Mode Added lite Red Zone Filter for Observers in Freecam Added custom ending variants to map/mode selection Added more arenas maps to map/mode selection Fixed Observer script error encountered in Arenas Fixed multiple script errors for Observes and Players for BR Fixed more real-time API event reporting. LEGEND META FUSE Enemies caught inside the ring of fire from Fuse's Motherlode ultimate are now revealed to Fuse's team. Knuckle Cluster Tactical explosion duration increased by 100%. Grenadier Passive can be toggled on and off to throw ordnance normally. Dev Note: Fuse continues to struggle. We identified two opportunities to help him that weren't just \"give him more damage.” We believe Apex is a gun game first and foremost and therefore want to make sure we don't put too much damage into character abilities. The first opportunity we identified was his tactical. While meant as a persistent area denial tool, it currently does not last long enough to seriously inconvenience an enemy. We doubled the duration so you can now place one at a door and be reasonably sure no one's coming through that door for a little while. While we doubled the duration, the damage per second remains the same. Please don’t stand in the fire. Secondly, his ultimate often didn't give his team an advantage; sure, you may catch enemies within it, but the flames made it impossible for you to step inside, and you couldn't see the enemies you trapped either because the flames were in the way. We explored a few ways to deal with this but ended up going for the most straight-forward answer: you get enemy outlines as long as they stay inside the ring of fire. HORIZON Reduced the slow after the initial Black Hole pull. Bumped Horizon gravity lift-up speed to a happy medium between 9.1 and Legacy update launch values. Dev note: There’s no doubt the nerfs Horizon received with Legacy were necessary, but given the benefit of time and hindsight we decided we probably hit the speed of her tactical too hard. Instead of completely reverting that part of the nerf, we found a happy medium between how fast her gravity lift operated at release and how slow it was after the nerf. This one's hard to communicate with numbers, so just give her a try and tell us what you think. REVENANT There’s now a visual and audio cue when Death Totem protection is about to end which can be seen/heard by other players. Added a brief slow after being recalled to Death Totem. CAUSTIC Gas damage starts at 5, increases by 1 every other tick indefinitely. Cooldown on Tactical has been reduced 25s -> 20s. Ultimate cooldown has been reduced 3.5m -> 3m. Duration reduced from 20s -> 15s. Dev note: Caustic is a dangerous character to buff. Push him a little too far, and he quickly takes over the meta. Constantly fighting through gas is no fun, so we definitely want to avoid him becoming dominant once more. That said, we're now convinced the nerf that dropped his gas damage to a flat 5 damage went too far. When you can sit in gas and take a syringe or two and be fine, gas is not a scary enough deterrent. So we switched back to a scaling model. This time we decided to let the damage scale a little more slowly. Instead of going up by one every tick, we're increasing it by one every other tick. Damage is uncapped at the top here, but really that's very theoretical. Enemies will generally be dead around the time the gas reaches 11 damage per tick (unless you've been healing). The desired effect here is to make enemies feel a great urgency to leave the gas as soon as possible. At the same time, we wanted to be mindful specifically of Caustic's impact in late game circles at the highest level. Even with Ring 6 now slowly closing over 100 seconds, we were worried about the effect that a single Caustic ult could have in the late game. We reduced its duration by 5 seconds. The ult represents Caustic's highest moment of power; his enemies have no way of countering it. 15 seconds is still a meaningful amount of time (and with the damage changes, 15s is long enough to kill someone) but it should hopefully make fighting a Caustic in the end game slightly less frustrating. WEAPON META SUPPLY DROP ROTATION {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d3f271ceb73c67ff00fd1c508b9c0ce826a90a8f.jpg This season the Prowler returns to floor loot and taking its place is the M600 Spitfire. In addition to the Spitfire this season another weapon will be joining the supply drop: the Alternator SMG. See how each weapon changes down below. HOP UPS Boosted Loader - Reloading near empty (but not at 0) increases reload speed and overloads the next magazine with extra rounds. This hop up will be equipable to the Hemlok Burst AR and the Wingman. To make room, the Anvil Receiver and Quickdraw Holster are being vaulted for now. FULLY KITTED ROTATION {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/23a73181f7815b46568d996cb32e4404041c02ca.jpg Added: Peacekeeper, Rampage, RE-45, Flatline, and Charge Rifle Removed: Wingman, Bocek, R99, Hemlock, and Sentinel MAGAZINE ATTACHMENTS Reload speed increase associated with magazines has been moved to the equivalent stock rarity tier. Dev Note Magazines are the most potent source of lootable power for most weapons and that largely comes in the form of ammo capacity. In addition to capacity, they were also offering increased reload speed. We’ve moved the reload speed buff to stocks to help increase the value of stocks and spread out our meaningful modifiers across our attachments. STOCK ATTACHMENTS All stocks now offer increased reload speed (instead of magazines) Marksman Weapons (30-30 Repeater, G7 Scout, Triple-Take) now take Sniper Stocks instead of Tactical Stocks Sniper Stocks on Marksman weapons will offer increased stability and sway reduction with slightly reduced handling bonuses (from tactical stocks) Dev Note Sniper stocks are an often lonely attachment left sitting on the floor waiting for a crackshot legend to come along and give them some love. Instead of reducing the spawn rates to try and clean up the loot pool we’re putting them on Marksman Rifles to make them more desirable. L-STAR Now takes Energy Magazines—Mags on the L-STAR work differently than other weapons because of its unique interaction with ammo. Instead they will allow the L-STAR to fire more shots before it overheats and allow it to cool-off its heat build up slightly faster. Now take Barrels for recoil reduction Projectile VFX scale reduced by roughly half First-Person on-hit impact effect intensity reduced Hipfire spread increased Dev Note The L-STAR has undergone a few changes in Emergence. We’ve attempted to improve the looting experience and extend the L-STAR’s power into the later phases of the game. In addition to these attachment additions the L-STAR is also seeing some VFX changes for combat readability. LIGHT MACHINE GUNS Reduced the headshot multiplier for all LMGs from 2.0 to 1.75 Increased the limbshot multiplier for all LMGs from 0.75 to 0.85 Dev Note LMG spray-and-pray was feeling a little too oppressive when random headshots chunked with a 2.0 damage modifier. We’re shaving off some of that headshot firepower but adding a little back in by bringing up their limb damage. Unloading massive LMG mags to suppress your enemies should still be a valid tactic, we’re just reigning in the peaks and valleys to make it feel a bit more consistent. PISTOLS Reduced handling time for all pistols by ~10% Raise, Holster, Zoom In/Out time Dev Note With the removal of the Quickdraw Holster and reload speed moving from mags to stocks Pistols took a bit of a hit. We’re increasing their base handling but will keep an eye on their performance as we get into Emergence. PROWLER BURST PDW Time Between Burst increased from 0.2 to .24 Dev Note The Prowler returns to the floor without its trusty side-kick the Select Fire hop up. But don’t sleep on it, it's still a beast. M600 SPITFIRE Damage increased from 18 to 19 Hip Fire Spread back to season 8 pre-nerf values Purple Mag Size increased from 50 to 55 Dev Note We’ve all woken up with a cold sweat in the middle of the night from a nightmare where Rampart with two gold mag spittys chases you on the World’s Edge train tracks laughing maniacally as she shoots for eternity, right? … right? Well for those of us that have, we’ll be able to sleep soundly for a while. The Spitfire takes its rightful place as a Supply Drop weapon this season. We’ve hit it a few times in recent patches and we still want it to be a desirable Supply Drop weapon so we’re walking back those nerfs while making it much harder to access. ALTERNATOR Reintroducing the Disruptor Rounds which come equipped on a Supply Drop Alternator Disruptor Rounds - Increase shield damage by 40% Disruptor Rounds can ONLY be found on Alternators from the Supply Drop Dev Note The Alternator joins the Spitfire in the Supply Drop with its old friend the Disruptor Rounds. The shield damage has come down since we last saw Disruptors in Season 2, but it’s still a shield shredding monster. Pack an extra bat. 30-30 REPEATER Reload speed from stocks is increased. Dev Note The 30-30 can slap, but when it's not slapping it’s probably reloading. We’re buffing the 30-30’s bonus to reload speed from stocks to help alleviate one of the sharper pain points when running this heavy rifle. EVA-8 Significantly reduced bolt fire-rate scaling for each rarity tier Base fire-rate remains unchanged Dev Note The EVA-8’s speed makes it a forgiving and formidable shotgun to run. It’s pulled ahead of the pack and has been seen as the clear choice for many leaving the Peacekeeper, Mastiff, and Mozambique in the dust. This change should help even the playing field between the shotguns. ARENAS WEAPON UPDATES Care package changes apply to arenas: the Prowler and Rampage replace the Alternator and Spitfire in the Arenas shop. Prowler Base: 450 Lvl 1: 200 Lvl 2: 300 Lvl 3: 400 Rampage Base: 500 Lvl 1: 200 Lvl 2: 300 Lvl 3: 350 ARENAS PRICE ADJUSTMENTS L-STAR Lvl 1: 100 -> 150 Lvl 2: 200 -> 250 Lvl 3: 300 -> 350 30-30 Repeater Lvl 1: 200 -> 150 Bocek Bow Base: 600 -> 500 Charge Rifle Base: 700 -> 600 Lvl 1: 250 -> 200 Lvl 2: 300 -> 200 Lvl 3: 400 -> 450 EVA-8 Base: 300 -> 350 Mastiff Base: 400 -> 350 Peacekeeper Base: 500 -> 350 Fuse Knuckle Cluster: 75 -> 100 ARENAS ABILITY ADJUSTMENTS Horizon's Gravity Lift starting charges reduced from 2 to 1 Mirage's Psyche Out starting charges reduced from 3 to 2 Bloodhound's free scans while in Beast of the Hunt reduced from 3 to 2 BUG FIXES Bloodhound Fixed an issue where Bloodhound's tactical failed to highlight the enemy for the Bloodhound player while they used an emote. Trident and Dropship audio should no longer be significantly dampened when Bloodhound is using their Ultimate. Gibraltar Corrected an audio issue with Gibraltars Dome Shield failing to make sound. Lifeline Fixed cases where Lifeline’s VO still says \"I've got you. Shields up\" even when she no longer has a shield. Pathfinder Pathfinder's Grapple no longer stays connected when he’s killed while under Revenant’s Death Protection. Updated Pathfinder \"Copper Core\" legs so they now match in first-person view. Fixed an issue where Pathfinder’s Grapple cooldown audio cue replayed rapidly after deploying tactical in gameplay. Wraith Wraith can no longer use her ultimate while attached to Valkyrie’s ultimate. Fixed a rare bug which allowed downed players to jump/bunny-hop after entering a Wraith Portal that was placed by a crouching Wraith. Bangalore Fixed an issue causing Bangalore's Smoke Launcher to disappear when moving away from other players with certain Legendary skins equipped. Caustic Fixed a bug that allowed Caustic Barrels to be pushed into players, crushing them. Fuse’s Ultimate \"Motherlode\" is no longer destroyed if it interacts with Caustic gas. Wattson’s ult will no longer shoot down friendly Caustic barrels and ults. Mirage Addressed an issue where Mirage's invisible revive wouldn’t fully cloak teammates when certain skins were being worn. Octane Fixed an exploit that allowed players to wedge an Octane jump pad between a supply bin to make the Trident faster. Fixed a visual bug where Octane's goggles moved independently after using his tactical. Wattson Removed the beam of light that shoots into the sky every time Wattson places down her fence. Crypto Arenas: Fixed a bug where Crypto’s Drone could be deployed and recalled infinite times when the user had only one charge available. Switch Only: Fixed a visual bug where Crypto's position indicator while in his drone flickered near the top and left edge of the screen. Switch Only: The UI for Crypto’s tactical charges should no longer overlap with the recharging UI when his drone is destroyed in Arenas. Fixed a bug that prevented the Drone from being able to detect enemies using Trident. Revenant Fixed a visual bug when the Heirloom appears to be floating in third-person when looking up and down inside the Gravity Lift. Placing a Death Totem too close to the edge of the map should no longer teleport players off the map when returning to the totem. Emote fix: Added the missing Silence Orb to Revenant's \"Suffering Silence\" emote. Fixed some exploitable hiding spots reachable in Rift using Revenant. Fixed some cases when Revenant didn’t have horizontal movement animations when holding the heirloom. Loba Lots of fixes across all maps to address issues with exploits, hiding spots, and inconsistencies with using Loba’s tactical. UI Fix: The ammo Count in Loba's Black Market should now display correctly. Rampart Fixed an issue that allowed Rampart's turret to be placed on Geyser. Fixed a bug that caused players to run faster after stowing a fully charged, chargeable weapon—this bug also caused the charged indicator in the UI to go away. Fixed an issue where Rampart’s wall would get stuck in an animation loop when hit by Caustic gas. Horizon Fixed an issue where a player’s weapon appears horizontally on the back while using a survey beacon. Fixed some cases causing Horizon Ultimate ability to be cancelled out when placed near a supply bin if the bin was opened during gameplay. Fuse Fixed a visual bug that caused part of Fuse’s body to pop up on the screen when toggling throw power after swapping grenades. General The audio triggered by players' landing impacts should be louder when they're coming in from a jump pad ",

Instead, it will increase in damage every other second: for instance, causing 5,5,6,6,7,7 points of damage, with no limit on how much it can increase. Balancing this out, however, the gas cloud created by Caustic's Nox Gas Grenade will disappear five seconds faster. Fuse is getting some even more significant (and much-needed) improvements, with his Knuckle Cluster lasting twice as long, and his Motherlode ability now highlighting enemies. Any enemy caught in the blast will be highlighted, even if they are hidden behind a building or wall. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-27-apex-legends-caustic-and-fuse-are-getting-buffs-in-emergence-patch\">Read more</a> ",

Arguably the most exciting part of the announcement, however, was the plan to return to LAN events. With players and fans alike being starved of offline Apex action for almost two years now due to the effects of the pandemic, the news that international LANs could be making a comeback \"should conditions allow\" was well-received. For the competition's commissioner, John Nelson, the return to LAN is also the thing he is looking most forward to - especially as it presents the opportunity to turn Year 1's regional storylines into global ones. \"It's been really fun to see so many different countries represented by players and competing against each other, and that obviously goes up a notch when you go to a global event,\" Nelson tells The Loadout. \"A lot of us in the community look back at the Preseason Invitational in September 2019 and think about all those teams that were on Match Point, going into the final game; teams from so many different places of the world.

Oh, and there's a snazzy new video for the new season. During this evening's EA Play event, game director Chad Grenier discussed Seer's abilities, describing him as similar to Bloodhound and \"all about tracking enemies\". Aiming down the sights will bring up a heartbeat sensor that will hint at an enemy's location. His tactical, meanwhile, sends drones out of his chest to reveal and track an enemy's location. Seer's ultimate also makes use of his microdrones, using them to create a sphere that senses enemies who move through it. For those who are concerned Seer may be a little bit too similar to Bloodhound, Grenier assured players that the new legend is more about stealth, and is able to gather \"precise and lingering information\". <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-22-new-apex-legend-seer-is-all-about-tracking-enemies\">Read more</a> ",

Year 2 of the ALGS will also boast a significantly bigger prize pool - a total of $5 million for the entire season, with $2 million of that allocated for the Championship.

Arenas launched without a competitive ladder at the start of Season 9, but Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier confirmed during an EA Future of FPS livestream that Season 10 will introduce a dedicated ranked mode. Arenas was the first permanent Apex Legends mode that was not a battle royale, and mashed its gameplay with smaller maps and a CS:GO or Valorant-style economy system where weapons and consumables could be bought at the start of each round. Now that it has had some time to settle, Respawn is keen to cater to the competitive crowd with an <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-ranks\">Arenas ranked</a> mode. While there were next to no other details given about it, including whether it will work similarly to the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks</a> for battle royale, the promise of a ranked mode will be music to the ears of Arenas players who have had little to grind for in Season 9. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-ranked-mode-season-10\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/seer-release-date-abilities\">Apex Legends Seer - release date, abilities, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-ranks\">Apex Legends Arenas ranks: ranking system explained and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-year-2\">Apex Legends Global Series will attempt to return to LAN in 2022</a> ",

The Thrillseekers Event kicks off July 13, 2021 and runs until August 3, 2021. Read on for details. NEW ARENAS MAP: OVERFLOW https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/thrillseekers-event-blog/overflow-05.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg The floor is lava! Well, some of it, anyway. Overflow differs from other Arena maps by being lane focused; where each location is separated by tall, lava-filled structures. With this separation, players cannot easily spot early decisions made by the other team and will need to stay vigilant before committing to a side or risk being flanked. While there are opportunities for long-range engagements, combat tends to favor short-to-medium ranges along either POI: Overlook or Slope. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/thrillseekers-event-blog/overflow-01.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Overlook is a long, open area with a central interior that gives a height advantage over this POI. While this area is perfect for snipers or DMRs, players may want to hold the interior to control not only this area but their flank as well. Slope, as the name implies, offers both a high ground and a unique area where players can slide down to a remote part of the map. This area can be used for sneaky flanks or defensive setups where players may not expect it. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/thrillseekers-event-blog/overflow-02.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Overflow feels pretty different from our other maps, and our hope is that it will feel rewarding for both defensive and aggressive players alike. Let us know what you think! https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/thrillseekers-event-blog/thrillseekers-rewards-track-v1.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Let’s talk about the good stuff: unlockables. For the three weeks of the event, we’re running back-to-back rewards tracks: Week one gives you a chance to unlock the Rampart Wastelander Set, which includes a matching gun charm, weapon skin, and a Legendary Rampart skin. Week two grants Battle Pass boosters, crafting metals, and Apex packs. Week three includes the Lethal Enforcer Bangalore Skin, along with other goodies! https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/thrillseekers-event-blog/apex-legends-screenshot-s9-thrillseekersevent-skin-01-rampart-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg You can earn over 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once. There will also be three specific badges you can unlock—one each week—for reaching certain milestones in Arenas: Week 1 Badge: Play 20 Arena Games Total Week 2 Badge: Get 100 Knockdowns Total in Arenas Week 3 Badge: Deal 12,000 Damage Total in Arenas THRILLSEEKERS COSMETICS AND SUMMER SPLASH SALE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/thrillseekers-event-blog/thrillseekers-splashsale.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Also kicking off on 7/13 is The Summer Splash Sale. For a couple of weeks, we’re bringing back fan-favorite skins—including Youngblood and Voidwalker!—and running some enticing sales on Apex packs. Check out the store once the event begins and check back daily to see what we’ve got. The Summer Splash Sale runs until 7/27. All these cosmetics are Event Limited.

There's always something to be updated, something to be iterated upon, and something new to be fashioned in order to keep millions of players around the world entertained, week after week. So how do developers find their fun amid this cycle of development for games that are constantly being updated? Well, in Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment's team of animators get their kicks from developing rare animations that'll only trigger for a small percentage of the player base at any one given time. These rare animations range from Octane twirling his syringe, to a weapon reloading in an unorthodox fashion. They might be a small part of the game - but it's where the animators of Apex Legends find their fun. Apex Legends animation lead Shawn Wilson, tells The Loadout that \"a lot of these animations come about when we have small pockets of free time.\" Wilson says that the rare animations hidden away in Apex Legends, like the magazine popping out of the top of the G7 Scout rifle, are one way that the development team relaxes and takes a load off at the end of a prolonged development period. It's a way for the development team to have some fun, knowing that they've got the \"core combat\" loop and metrics down and perfected. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/rarest-animations\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/apex-legends-seer-teaser\">Apex Legends teases potential new legend Seer in story trailer</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-ranked-mode-season-10\">Apex Legends Arenas will get a ranked mode in Season 10</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-ranks\">Apex Legends Arenas ranks: ranking system explained and more</a> ",

STORE OFFERS https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/genesis-collection-event/apex-legends-genesis-blog-calendar-v2.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Some limited-time bundles will be available throughout the event. See the image above for the rundown. LEGEND BALANCE UPDATES Octane Launch Pad cooldown increased from 60 seconds to 90 seconds. Dev Note: Octane remains the most popular legend by a large margin even after the stim nerf. Turns out jump pads are fun, but with the added utility from the two launch options, it’s only fair to bump up the cooldown. Revenant Slightly slimmed down hitbox (specifically his midsection, arms, and upper legs). https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/genesis-collection-event/apex-legends-hitbox-revenant.png.adapt.1920w.png Stalker climb height significantly increased. It's not literally unlimited now, but... that boy can really climb. Silence duration decreased from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. Reduced the duration of death protection by 5 seconds while using the Death Totem. Dev Note: Revenant’s large frame places him at a significant disadvantage in gunfights, particularly against smaller legends who no longer have Low Profile. We’re shrinking some of his hitboxes to counteract this disadvantage, while also improving his ability to climb up walls and attack from unexpected angles. (We know this can be frustrating given how silent he is, so we'll continue to monitor and add sound if necessary.) That said, we’re taking this opportunity to reduce some of the frustration that comes when playing against his tactical and ultimate. Lifeline Increased hit box size, mostly in the legs and waist. Dev Note: Unlike Revenant, Lifeline excels in gunfights given her small hitbox. Even with the res shield gone, it’s no surprise the smallest character in the game saw an uptick in performance with the removal of Low Profile. She remains small, but these hitbox changes bring her closer to the medium sized legends. Bloodhound Eye of the Allfather scan revealed time decreased from 4 seconds to 3 seconds. Beast of the Hunt duration decreased from 35 seconds to 30 seconds. Time can still be added by downing enemies. Dev Note: Bloodhound has remained a popular and powerful pick for multiple seasons now, mostly because of the sheer amount of information that can be gained with one tap of their tactical. Shortening the scan duration still provides a snapshot of information for Bloodhound’s team without stifling all enemies caught anywhere in the large range for a full 4 seconds. Wattson Major Buff: Wattson can now place more than one Nessie on the map at a time with her Epic emote. Dev Note: There can now be up to 20 Nessies active at once on any given map. Until that cap is reached, any Wattson can place as many as she likes. When the cap is hit, the oldest Nessie belonging to the Wattson who currently owns the most Nessies is removed. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/genesis-collection-event/apex-legends-screenshot-s9-genesiscollectionevent-03-skin-pathfinder-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg WEAPONS BALANCE UPDATES P2020 Increased Fire Rate from 6.25 -> 7.0 Increased Base Ammo from 12 -> 14 Increased Lvl 1 Mag from 14 -> 16 Increased Lvl 2 Mag from 16 -> 18 Increased Lvl 3 and Lvl 4 Mag from 18 -> 21 Spitfire Increased Hip Fire spread Dev Note: The Spitfire has continued to over perform so we're hitting it's close range hip fire accuracy which should help bring it in line. 30-30 Repeater Slightly increased projectile speed Reduced charge time from 0.5s -> 0.35s Longbow Damage increased from 55 -> 60 ARENAS UPDATES https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/genesis-collection-event/apex-legends-screenshot-s9-legacy-genesiscollectionevent-06-env-arena-skulltown-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg ARENAS PRICE ADJUSTMENTS The figures below represent changes to the cost in materials to unlock or upgrade weapons, utilities, and Legend abilities in Arenas matches.

Pathfinder’s Zipline round cooldown increased from every round to every other round. Rampart’s Sheila round cooldown reduced from every 3 rounds to every other round. Wattson’s Interception Pylon round cooldown increased from every round to every other round. Octane’s Launch Pad cooldown increased from every round to every other round. Octane’s Stim starting charges reduced to 2 charges from 3. Other Added a scoreboard to the map screen. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/genesis-collection-event/apex-legends-genesis-blog-mapscoreboard.png.adapt.1920w.png You can now report players by pressing in the map screen https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/genesis-collection-event/apex-legends-genesis-blog-reportscreen.png.adapt.1920w.png From Round 3 and onward, you’ll now start with a shield battery in addition to 2 syringes and 2 shield cells. Care packages will also land 5s earlier to make the contained weapons a more viable option before the round closes out. 6x scope moved from base sniper weapons to Lvl 1 upgrade. ARENAS MAP ADJUSTMENTS Party Crasher Adjusted circle logic to favor downtown a bit more. Simplified the minimap’s visual language. Phase Runner Raised cover height on certain props throughout the map to prevent unfair advantages to large rig Legends. Added a few trees to reduce the ease of spawn sniping (looking at you, Reptar…). ARENAS BUG FIXES The UI for Purple devotion now shows the attached turbocharger. Players will no longer be chosen as Jump Masters during the legend select screen. Updated the sniper stock to show an empty slot when needed. Can no longer get stuck in the crouch position after dying while reviving a teammate during a round in Arenas. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Valkyrie Updated fuel gauge UI to better indicate when you’re using fuel and when you’re running low. Rampart Will now have custom animations for LMG reload. These have no impact on her current reload times. MISC Added VO for when your Ultimate is ready, or not ready. When your Ultimate gets to 100%, you’ll be prompted to tell your team with new VO for each Legend. At any point in time, you can ping your Ultimate icon (in your inventory) to show your teammate what percentage you’re at (in quickchat). Added VO for when you enter a Replicator, so your teammates know you are crafting and won’t leave you behind! Probably. Added VO for pinging a friendly Trident, in addition to the neutral and enemy states that already existed. You can now turn off FOV scaling when certain abilities are used. Look in the options. Reduced the frequency of Ring endings near out-of-bounds areas (like canyon walls or map edges). Healing items will now play the entire healing sound when used by other players, instead of just the beginning and ending. Muting players will now also mute text to speech. BUG FIXES Bloodhound Passive tracker icons will no longer be shown in the end-of-game screen. Caustic Fixed an issue with enemies not getting highlighted when in Caustic’s Nox Gas. Fuse Players can now see the number of grenades in the grenades stack when viewed on floor. Fixed the 1P arm color on “Board to Death” to match the 3P view. Fuse will no longer produce a third arm when ADS’ing and using the tactical at the same time. Gibraltar Being struck by a direct hit of Fuse’s Knucklecluster will no longer cause Gibraltar’s Gun shield to take unnecessary damage. Gibby’s Ultimate will no longer damage a friendly’s Horizon’s Ult. Gun Shield will no longer take additional bleed through damage. Horizon Horizon’s tactical will no longer ascend Caustic’s gas traps or Octane's Jump pads to the heavens. Fixed an issue with the appearance of Horizon's teeth when using the \"Golden Boson\" skin. Lifeline Lifeline will no longer use Wraith’s animations while in the boxing ring. Enemy Care packages will now have loot if the enemy Lifeline leaves the game before it lands. Fixed an issue that was preventing Lifeline's tactical from functioning properly while in Caustic gas. Loba Completed another pass to prevent Loba from getting into unallowed areas. Fixed an issue causing Loba's tactical to improperly fail on the Phase Runner map in Arenas. Fixed an issue that caused Loba's tactical to be improperly disrupted by Horizon's gravity lift. Mirage Corrected an issue with Mirage flickering while in the Lobby. Octane Fixed obstructed ADSing while using the Compound bow and the 3x sight. Pathfinder Can no longer swap weapons faster if the holster animation is canceled. Did a Zipline pass on Arena Maps to prevent Pathfinder getting into unfair positions. Rampart Fixed a logic error when using Wraith’s Portal and Sheila at the same time. Did a pass to allow more places to place Amped Walls on Olympus. Fixed an audio issue with Rampart’s Tactical when in close quarters. Fixed an issue with Sheila disappearing off of Rampart’s back if shot during an emote. Players no longer fall under the ground when using Shelia on certain slopes. Revenant Death Totem can now be damaged in Firing Range. Valkyrie Did an environment pass to prevent Valk from entering areas not meant to be entered. Amped cover will no longer push players into geo if Skyward Dive is initiated near it. Valkyrie’s Ult UI no longer remains on screen if observer switches to another POV. First person view no longer obstructed when using a shield battery. Fixed an issue with players not being able to cancel being hooked up to Valks Ult. Wattson Wattson no longer uses Wraith’s animation in the boxing ring. The Nessie that Watton leaves behind with her Epic emote should no longer fall over dead when using a Legendary skin. Wraith Addressed a bug that sometimes caused Wraith's portal to improperly appear as open after a player entered it just before it closed. Other Fixed a bug where players have to play one Ranked game after a Season or Split reset for the reset to fully take effect. Note that players who have not played a Ranked game recently before this update will still have to play one more game of Ranked with their RP changing before this bug is completely fixed. Matchmaking will be canceled if the party leader changes the playlist to a mode that a party member is not eligible for. Fixed an issue preventing Switch users from scrolling through all their emotes while in handheld mode. Resolved an issue that was sometimes slowing down controller players' turn speeds when running at high FPS. Addressed some audio issues with Phoenix Kits. Entering the Fight Night ring on Olympus should no longer cause you to experience glitches with gunfire audio. Solved a performance problem caused by having large numbers of friends via Steam and/or Origin. Knocked legends can now open the inner door inside Explosive Holds as normal. Your scope sight should no longer flicker when ADSing using the Bocek Bow while riding a Trident. Similarly to the above, ADSing with the Bocek Bow while riding a zipline should no longer cause flickering. Resolved an issue that was preventing ping VO from playing when at a distance from teammates. Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented players from joining a friend's lobby when using the \"join\" button from the Friends tab. Solved an issue that was preventing Respawn beacon audio from triggering properly. Fixed some buttons with weird \"hitboxes\" in the Clubs tab.

Oh, and everyone's favourite murder site, Skull Town, is being introduced as an Arenas map. The Genesis Collection Event kicks off on 29th June and lasts until 13th July, offering a bunch of new paid cosmetics (and what looks like an extremely cool Revenant scythe heirloom). As usual, you can acquire these by purchasing event packs or buying them directly with Apex Coins or Crafting Materials.

Over the past 18 months, Apex Legends esports has gone from practically a non-entity - with only a couple of show matches and one-off tournaments - to hosting a worldwide tournament with a $2.5 million prize pool. With BLAST and Dreamhack also looking to get in on the Apex Legends esports action, things are looking positive for the battle royale's high-level scene. However, the journey hasn't been easy. The first major Apex Legends events, the EXP Invitational at X Games Minneapolis and the Preseason Invitational hosted in Kraków, Poland, were held in August and September 2019 respectively. Since then, fans haven't been able to attend a single tournament in-person, and players have been forced to play online for reasons beyond their control. The effects of the global pandemic on the esports industry are clear, but the Apex Legends Global Series was set to launch just as lockdowns began and events shut down. As such, ALGS commissioner John Nelson had to scrap his roadmap of a year of in-person tournaments and adapt to an era of online competition. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-2021-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/save-titanfall-hack\">Apex Legends targeted by hacker who wants to \"save Titanfall\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/rarest-animations\">Rare Apex Legends animations help \"inject personality\" into its cast of characters</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 9</a> ",

Once a team has reached this threshold, it must then win one match outright to be crowned the tournament winner. This is where the controversy lies. Despite the fact that teams need to perform consistently in order to reach Match Point, there is an element of luck (based on the loot teams find or where the final circle pulls) that can impact the outcome of those crucial matches towards the end of a tournament.. \"There's no denying the power of the Match Point format in terms of generating drama and enthusiasm around the competition,\" ALGS commissioner John Nelson tells The Loadout. Knowing who has won a tournament as soon as the final match finishes creates exciting endgames that are unique to Apex Legends esports, but not everybody is a fan. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-match-point-john-nelson\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 9</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 9: ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/save-apex-ranked-campaign\">Top Apex Legends players put pressure on Respawn to 'Save Apex Ranked'</a> ",

The Apex Legends Global Series kicked off in January 2020, with grand plans of hosting its first Major at the Esports Stadium in Arlington, Texas in March and two Premier Events in Paris and Bucharest in April and May. Unfortunately, the live events never came to fruition, and the ALGS has never hosted a LAN tournament. Other than a handful of show matches and the legendary Preseason Invitational in Kraków, Poland back in September 2019, Apex Legends as an esport has barely seen in-person events. Many players long for LANs, and the creators of the ALGS understandably want live events back too, when it's safe to do so. But the pandemic has also had a profound impact on the teams themselves, with many unable to compete in-person, and most playing in the biggest esports tournaments from the less than ideal comfort of their own bedrooms. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/complexity-ishiny-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-athaim-cheating\">Apex Legends team voices cheating concerns following ALGS Championship</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-loba-third-impact\">How Loba is stealing the show at the ALGS Championship</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-winner-paradox\">\"Don't give up on your dreams,\" says South American ALGS Championship winner Paradox</a> ",

Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. As explained by associate live balance designer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RSPN_JayBiebs/status/1397333406292140035?s=20\">John Larson</a>, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie's jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to \"take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims\". It reminds me a bit of when <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-12-fortnites-infinity-blade-is-wrecking-its-own-usd1m-tournament\">Fortnite players used planes</a> to stay out of battles until the very last moment. In any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RSPN_JayBiebs/status/1397340569685221377?s=20\">Larson said</a> that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this \"didn't feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-26-apex-legends-valkyrie-will-no-longer-be-able-to-take-mid-air-coffee-breaks\">Read more</a> ",

The ability isn't listed as one of the new character's official abilities, but it concerns how her passive and tactical interact. When the newest entrant to the Apex Games uses her passive VTOL jets - that's her jet pack - it consumes fuel at a rapid rate to ensure she can't stay in the air for too long. However, that changes while Valkyrie is aiming her Missile Swarms. When aiming her tactical while in the air, Valkyrie consumes 10% of the usual fuel, allowing her to send an accurate cluster of paralysing missiles towards opposing teams. However, players have been abusing this 'tactical hover' interaction, especially during the final circles of competitive matches. As a result, Respawn is removing this feature as the developers are worried that it could impact the quality of the ALGS Championship. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/valkyrie-tactical-hover-nerf\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-athaim-cheating\">Apex Legends team voices cheating concerns following ALGS Championship</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-loba-third-impact\">How Loba is stealing the show at the ALGS Championship</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-winner-paradox\">\"Don't give up on your dreams,\" says South American ALGS Championship winner Paradox</a> ",

However, it's the North American tournament that is grabbing the headlines, thanks to a mixup in the preparations that have caused the teams to be drawn and redrawn three times already. The issues became apparent after the first draw, which saw some teams draft multiple Apex Predator-level players, despite efforts to make sure that did not happen. Players had been split into three categories, one group of Apex Predators, one group of Master and Diamond players, and one group of players Platinum or below. The latter group are team captains, and draft one player from each other category to create balanced teams - in theory. However, it transpired that some players had climbed the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks</a> since submitting their application to Twitch Rivals, rendering some teams significantly more powerful than others. Twitch Rivals' esports community manager, Blake 'CloudFuel' Tull decided to redraft the teams in order to prevent one team dominating the field and creating a boring competition, as happened with the last Twitch Rivals event in March which saw TSM's Phillip 'ImperialHal' Dosen and Eric 'Snip3down' Wrona drafted to the same team and romp to victory. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/twitch-rivals-may-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-winner-paradox\">\"Don't give up on you dreams,\" says South American ALGS Championship winner Paradox</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/atk-interview\">The pursuit of low ping: one player's 6,000-mile journey to the ALGS Championship</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in patch 1.71</a> ",

GLL reiterated its rules in a statement posted to Twitter, explaining the rule in full: \"Players with Apex Legends bans on any accounts within two (2) years are not eligible to compete in any of the tournaments hosted by GLL.\" The tournament organiser's post-tournament investigation found the Avangard players had broken this rule, and the team was therefore disqualified. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/avangard-gll-ban\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/g2-aimassist\">G2 returns to Apex Legends esports</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-weekend-2-review\">ALGS Championship weekend two: wins for Paradox, Crazy Raccoon, and Loba</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in patch 1.70</a> ",

The rules for teams were simple: one pro, one streamer, and one woman, with only one player who could have ever been a finalist in an official EA tournament. Day one of the tournament took place on May 13, and saw teams take to Arenas to vie for supremacy in a win race. The second day will see teams take to battle royale mode in a more traditional tournament style. Due to the fact that Arenas doesn't have private match functionality at present, teams raced to register as many wins in the new mode as possible within a four-hour time limit. This led to most teams ending up queueing against each other in exciting 3v3s, but some matches saw the stacked squads roll over unsuspecting opponents who were not competing. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-tournament-lulus-throwdown\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-weekend-2-review\">ALGS Championship weekend two: wins for Paradox, Crazy Raccoon, and Loba</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in patch 1.70</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/complexity-ishiny-interview\">Complexity's iShiny will finally meet his Apex Legends teammates for the ALGS Championship</a> ",

Nessy is widely regarded as one of the best competitors in the region, and up there with the best in the world, but the players have had a rocky time with organisations. Jake 'jmw' Walters, Martin 'Graceful' Wongprom, and Rasmus 'maydeelol' Zettergren played for Triumph until the organisation released its whole roster and ceased competition in Apex Legends. The players stayed together as Nessy for five months, before Graceful and maydeelol signed to North's all-Scandinavian roster in December 2020. The group reformed Nessy in February 2021, after <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/MCD-winter-circuit-interview\">North's dramatic collapse</a>. Since then, the team has reportedly fended off contracts with big orgs, holding out for something that suited them perfectly.

Swathes of players took to social media to report false bans, which were preventing them from logging in. While timing out from a server or going AFK were being reported as potential reasons for the bans, some players were reporting bans being issued mid-match with no inactivity. It was a real head-spinner - but according to a tweet from EA's support account, the issue appears to now be under control. The tweet declares that EA has \"fixed the login issues some of you were having with Apex Legends,\" but some are still claiming they are locked out of their accounts due to bans caused by the issue. The general consensus is that if the issue keeps persisting, ensure you have fully restarted your game and system so you can fully log back into the servers.

The Spitfire and newly-added Bocek Bow, both considered overpowered by the player community, have been adjusted to make them a little less lethal. As explained on the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/legacy-update-patch-notes\">Legacy patch notes page</a>, the Spitfire's bullet damage has been reduced from 19 to 18, while gold and purple magazines will now hold 50 bullets instead of 55. The Bocek seems to be getting a much more severe nerf, with maximum damage decreased from 70 to 60, stack size decreased from 16 to 14 and inventory slot count decreased from 48 to 28. The Bocek's charge up time and Deadeye's Tempo hop-up charge time are also being increased by 0.2 seconds. I imagine this is all to prevent this sort of thing from happening: The update also brings a number of fixes to the game - including one for those <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-05-apex-legends-legacy-season-got-off-to-a-popular-but-rocky-start\">low-detail character models</a> (\"goodbye derpy blob Legends, you will be missed\" say the patch notes). At one point Valkyrie's passive was highlighting players that were \"not alive and/or in spectator mode,\" something that has also been fixed. Creepy.

Just two days after launch, <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1172470\">Steam Charts</a> recorded Apex's highest ever peak of 330,000 players on the platform - an incredible 100,000 more than the previous record set back in March this year. However, the hype was quickly replaced by concerns over the performance of Apex's newest weapon - the Bocek bow. The Bocek is an absolute monster of a weapon. It's silent, hits hard - you can check the numbers in our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bocek-bow\">Bocek bow guide</a> - has no damage drop off, and even at mid-range is effectively hitscan. Oh, and it fits 48 arrows into a stack, making it incredibly inventory-efficient. Even pro players are having a nightmare of a time playing against the bow. Jack 'NiceWigg' Martin, for example, took to Twitter to vent his frustrations, saying the current meta is like \"fighting in a survival game\".

Your only method of combating hackers - other than contacting Respawn's ban hammer-wielding security guard Conor 'Hideouts' Ford himself - is using the game's report function, which was somewhat limited before now.

He researches the teams, he finds the action, he follows the storylines; you name it, and Dazs does it. While he collaborates and works with <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-broadcast-interview\">Joe Lynch, EA's head of broadcast</a>, and the larger Apex Legends broadcast team, he is largely left to his own devices.

What makes a man get up in the small hours of the morning every other weekend to shoutcast a tournament for a region that he doesn't represent, for no pay? After all, SoaR competes in the NA region, where Dazs lives and works, and in a LAN-less tournament scene it will rarely compete against teams from APAC North or any other region.

We’re going beyond Battle Royale with Arenas, introducing a new Legend (Valkyrie), as well as new Arenas maps, an Olympus map update, and much more. Click the video down below to watch. New for Apex Legends: Legacy Arenas {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/f886ff925edc9363f2c80bfecf8342fa26a547a5.png The Games are going underground with the introduction of a new permanent mode: Arenas. Fully reassembled and unimpressed with the glitz and glamor of the Apex Games, former Apex Predator Ash is taking the competition back to its roots. A purer form of combat. The rules are simple: 3-versus-3. Eliminate your enemies to win the round. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You win, or you die. Arenas features a new set of custom maps, tailor-made for close-quarters combat (with more to come in the future). Squads start each round in a spawn room, where they can get weapons, gear, and abilities, and adjust their loadout as their strategy changes. The first team to win three rounds with at least a two-point lead will be crowned the victor—unless they battle to a four-four tie. Then they’ll have the honor of participating in Ash’s favorite part of the game: Sudden Death. For more on Arenas, check out the blog for a full deep dive into the new mode. Party Crasher Short version, Mirage took the voyage on a joyride and it didn’t go as planned. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/e4421c8892cc85f1dbcf4f25d22ddb1628684c28.png Party Crasher is one of two exciting custom arenas where you’ll be able to show off your skills. This arena takes place in a ritzy, downtown plaza where players can choose to engage on the crashed Mirage Voyage, or the opulent two story buildings that make up the downtown. Stay vigilante, as this map hosts a variety of engagement distances—both close quarters and long distance. Phase Runner The Phase Runner on Olympus is unique, but it wasn’t the first of its kind. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/75fe2134ad58fa8a9e104a885374d4ee7e319b56.png Phase Runner is the second of our custom arenas, and our largest. You’ll fight in a hidden, experimental zone at the peak of a mountain where a prototype phase runner lays for use. This map gives you a lot of space to maneuver, so be sure to be on the lookout for those who prefer to be patient and take you out from afar. Sound tactics and clear communication are what you’ll need to come out on top as you fight through the construction site or near the phase runner exit. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d55bf59e2f9274957762c2bb16385ece20d83b4b.png In addition to the two new maps, other areas from our three BR maps will be thrown into a bi-weekly rotation, giving you five maps total for Arenas. At the start you’ll get Artillery from Kings Canyon, Thermal Station from World’s Edge, and Golden Gardens from Olympus. Valkyrie Kairi Imahara, the daughter of Apex Predator Viper, salvaged the remains of her father's Northstar Titan years after his death. With Rampart's help, she fashioned it into a sleek new jetpack that honors her family’s legacy. Now, she’s entered the Games under the name VALKYRIE. Passive: VTOL Jets Use your jetpack to reposition or reach high places. You have limited fuel and cannot use weapons while flying. Tactical: Missile Swarm Fire a swarm of mini-rockets which damage and disorient the enemy. Ultimate: Skyward dive Take to the skies to reposition a long distance across the map. Your squadmates can join in. Class: Recon Scanning Survey Beacons reveals the next circle’s location. Bocek {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/25a237af66c2de325db04172e8797c04b7be3815.png The new Bocek (pronounced bow-check) compound bow is a precision marksman weapon that rewards a skilled and confident hand. Holding down fire will draw the bow over a short time, increasing the power of the shot, with maximum power giving optimal damage and projectile speed. Repeatedly firing the Bocek right as it reaches max power provides the best sustained damage. The Bocek uses a new ammo type, Arrows, which are unique to this weapon. Arrows are more rare on the battlefield, but fired arrows will stick into surfaces and remain in the world for players to pick back up and reuse. The 1x hcog classic, 1x holosight, 2x hcog, 1x-2x variable, and 3x hcog optics can all be equipped. The Bocek can also be further modified with the two new hop-ups entering the game, Shatter Caps and Deadeye’s Tempo; it can even equip both hop-ups simultaneously! Olympus - The Lost Fleet Update {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/acfae18491f78f1c10a6a76afcef71e46eb940cb.png A fleet of mysterious ships have made their way to Olympus and brought with them an otherworldly, parasitic plant that has begun to take root along the surface. The lead ship, The Icarus, has docked with the city and changed the landscape for good. Fight through the claustrophobic halls of the ghost ship, search corpses for a mysterious key card, and walk away as the last squad standing. Read our latest map update blog to get a detailed look at what’s changed on Olympus. To allow everyone to see the latest map update, Olympus will be the only map in rotation for the first week of the new season. Starter Kit and Loot Changes {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d5cd455de63650fd85154849d8269963685bad39.png Players will now start a match with a “Starter Kit” consisting of a Level 1 EVO Shield, Helmet, and Knockdown Shield, plus two Shield Cells and Syringes each. We’ve removed Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the loot pool. Spawn chances for Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool have been significantly reduced. Along with the lowered or removed spawn chances for these items, we’ve rebalanced the loot pool such that higher-level versions of these items will appear nearly the same as they do now, but other item types will appear more often (weapons, ordinance, health, ammo, etc.) Dev note We've wanted to take a crack at improving the loot game for a while, with our design goals being to make picking up loot feel more impactful to the game, and to thin out our loot a bit in general, since we're always adding new items to the pool. The recent Locked & Loaded takeover mode helped us field-test some of the changes we're looking to make moving forward: certain pieces of loot, and low-tier loot types specifically, are being put on notice. We're removing Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the ground loot because these seemed like the least exciting, least meaningful equipment pickups we had. Their power is practically invisible, so they don't really feel like a character improvement in the way that things like, say, a Backpack feels (getting those extra slots feels SO chunky!). We're keeping Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool (albeit at a lower spawn chance) in addition to adding them to your starter kit because having them sprinkled around is still important for \"shield-swapping\" shenanigans. Finally, granting these pieces of gear from the start of the game is also intended to improve the \"hot drop\" situation: having more health, some headshot damage reduction, and a little knockdown protection can help give players some more time to react to a chaotic hot drop than before. Be on the lookout for more loot changes in the future! This will be an ongoing project. Emotes Introducing Emotes! Every Legend will have one emote unlocked at launch and additional emotes can be obtained through Apex packs or by crafting them. Equip your emotes to the emote wheel and flex away! It’s great fun to show off to your squadmates in the starting room of Arenas, and of course you have to use them on the Winner’s podium. Now, since emotes kick your camera back to a third-person view, we know some folks are already thinking about corner peeking. Competitive integrity is still paramount, so enemies that your character couldn’t see in first-person view will not be shown while you are in third person. This video shows the “Anti-Peek” feature working on the purple Dummie behind the rock. Without it, Pathfinder would be able to use the 3rd person camera to gain knowledge that he shouldn’t have. All emotes have Anti-Peek enabled and there is no way to disable it. Battlepass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c0d00952e6602718b5545a53279b83e1aae8a078.jpg Unlock the premium Legacy Battle Pass and level it up to unlock new skins like Rampart’s Crafty Kitsune at Premium Level 25 and Wraith’s Demon’s Whisper at Premium Level 50. Legend Updates Low Profile Characters Low profile no longer exists! This trait has been removed from Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson. Dev Note After our successful experiment with Wraith's hitboxes, we are now confident that we can solve balance issues between smaller and larger Legends through changes to their kits and hitboxes. It is finally time for Low Profile to go the way of the dodo. (Sorry dodos.) Lifeline Combat Revive: No longer deploys a shield. Can now revive two players at the same time. Can now cancel active revives in progress to allow your teammate to defend themselves with their knockdown shield. D.O.C. Heal Drone: Heal rate increased from 5hp per second to 8hp per second. Deployment time before healing begins reduced by roughly 33%. Care Package: Cooldown reduced from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. Now guarantees an upgrade (if possible) in three categories: Body Shield, Other Equipment (Helmet, Backpack, and Knockdown Shield), and Weapon Attachment, based on your team’s current gear when the Package arrives. Dev Note Lifeline’s kit was not in a particularly healthy place. The Passive shield was extremely strong to the point of frustration, while her Tactical and Ultimate seemed like they were becoming more and more obsolete. These changes are aimed to redistribute this big power differential between all of her abilities, making D.O.C. and Care Package more powerful and effective, while tamping down on the highly binary and situational Combat Revive. Octane Stim: Reduced cooldown between stims from 4s to 1s. Increased health cost from 12hp to 20hp Increased bullet spread while in the air and shooting from the low Launch Pad trajectory. Dev Note Octane continues to perform really well after the latest changes. Too well? We still love the frequency of the Jump Pad, but we’d like to make using Stim something Octane thinks about doing at the right time, instead of always slamming it by default. Loba Burglar's Best Friend: Can now run and slide at full speed while aiming the bracelet and while the bracelet is in the air. Loba will no longer be slowed after translocating. Fixed a lot of bugs that caused bracelet tosses to fail. Black Market Boutique: Increased cooldown from 90s to 120s. Horizon Gravity Lift: Reduced lift speed by 30%. Reduced side-to-side acceleration. Limited the time you can sit at the top of Gravity Lift to 2 seconds. Increased cooldown from 15s to 20s. Horizon’s abilities will now get zapped by Wattson pylons. Dev Note Horizon is powerful and popular, but that's not why we're making these changes. We believe that mistakes in Apex Legends should be punishable, and when Horizon could just get herself out of bad positioning while popping a whole battery, this just wasn't true. These changes have two goals: 1) make it much more possible for enemies to shoot Horizon as she sits in her gravity lift and 2) make gravity lift less of an impromptu sniper tower. Fuse Knuckle Cluster: Fuse now has two stacks of Knuckle Cluster. Reduced cooldown from 25s to 20s. Dev Note More help is coming, but we want to be very careful how we buff him so that he doesn't just become the Legend that kills you with his abilities. Bangalore Smoke Launcher: Thickened Bangalore’s smoke. Dev Note Last patch we optimized Bangalore’s smoke particles and inadvertently thinned them out. This aims to get her back to the original visuals while keeping the optimizations. Bloodhound No longer receives assists from Eye of the Allfather. Dev Note Bloodhound's scan is strong, but the goal of this change in particular is to reconsider assists and their implications for Ranked Points. There's enough intrinsic value in sonar scans, and it's a slippery slope to consider crediting assists for other non-damaging abilities. Crypto will remain an exception. The active nature of Crypto's drone scan is notably different from the passive option with Bloodhound. This should encourage Bloodhound players to act on the information they get from the scan, to eliminate instances where they might try to snag a quick assist without committing to a fight in the same way Crypto has to. Crypto Crypto's drone can now scan and open care packages. Can no longer use his drone to \"hijack\" a respawn beacon that's already in use. Weapons Updates Marksman Weapon Category {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/2fe89a31156d112fa4ad6631b001985b3a3138c0.png The G7 Scout and the 30-30 are currently in the Assault Rifle weapons category, but they are a bit strange in that category due to their firing style and some of their handling values. Similarly, the Triple Take felt a little out of place in the Sniper category. With the introduction of the Bocek bow, we felt it was a good time to introduce a new weapons category, Marksman Weapons, which will include the G7, 30-30, Triple Take, and Bocek. Weapons in this category are precision weapons that are most effective up to medium-long range, and are the sort of in-betweens of Assault Rifles and Snipers. This allows us to begin moving the settings of these weapons towards more consistent value for the class, and make the settings of ARs and Snipers more consistent with less outliers. For starters, we are increasing the movement speed while aiming down sights for marksman weapons; They were at sniper speeds, and will now be between sniper and AR speeds. Additionally, we have done some targeted normalization of hipfire spread amounts. Supply Drop Rotation {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/83c0c2aa85e69e7792e02d34cf86648301939f1b.png This season, we’re taking the Peacekeeper out of the supply drop and putting the Triple Take in its place. Of course, with any supply drop change, these weapons will have their stats updated. See how each weapon changes down below. Crate Weapon Drop Rates: Since we are exchanging a shotgun with a marksman weapon, now was a good time to rebalance the drop rates of crate weapons. The Kraber will spawn less often in the early game and more often in the mid game to better accommodate its power. The Triple Take will be the most common early game crate weapon, with the Prowler being the most prominent late game crate weapon. Fully Kitted Rotation {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/eb021e369b59c6aac5c99774f5b77e15b35d33c4.png Added: Wingman, Bocek, R99, Hemlock, and Sentinel Removed: R301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, and Spitfire Hop Ups Shatter Caps - Fire select to toggle between standard mode and shatter mode. In shatter mode, rounds split into a blast pattern on firing. This hop up will be equipable to the 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek. Deadeye’s Tempo - Firing at the perfect moment increases fire rate. This can currently be attached to the Sentinel and the Bocek. To make room, the Hammerpoint and Skullpiercer hop ups are being vaulted for now, and won’t be available. Assault Rifles Reducing the headshot multiplier for all assault rifles from 2.0 to 1.75 Dev Note This was already the case for the Hemlok, so the affected guns are the R301, Flatline, and Havoc. Peacekeeper It comes with the Precision Choke by default, which can be toggled off Pellet damage reduced from 10 to 9 Rechamber time increased from 0.9 seconds to 1.1 seconds Reload times increased (regular from 2.45 to 2.5, empty from 3.35 to 3.5) Pellet spread increased in general, and spread when charged increased for all charge levels (from 0.65/0.45/0.2 to 0.85/0.65/0.35) Quickly loses charge after leaving ADS Dev Note Since the Peacekeeper is coming out of the crate, we are bringing many of the stats back in line with their previous values. We are also reducing its damage potential and bringing in the effective range a bit since the Precision Choke is always available now. Triple Take As a crate weapon, it will come with a 9 ammo clip and 63 reserve ammo Fire rate increased from 1.2 to 1.3 Time to full charge reduced from 1.1 seconds to 1 second Retains charge briefly after leaving ADS Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased spread while airborne and aiming down sights Havoc Increased recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note This should help make up for the reduced headshot multiplier and make it a bit more usable in mid-range fights. Spitfire Reduced recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note The Spitfire is too strong at the moment, boasting good damage output with low recoil. Making it a bit harder to control early in the pattern should give more time for opponents to fight against it. That said, we’re prepared to make more changes to the Spitfire if it remains too powerful. 30-30 Repeater Increased leg damage multiplier from 0.75 to 0.85 Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs Dev Note The 30-30 could use some love, so we’re bringing up the amount of leg damage it does. This should make it a bit more consistent without raising it’s high “best case” damage potential. G7 Scout Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased hipfire spread size (reduced accuracy) to be more in line with other marksman weapons Dev Note The 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek Compound Bow have more accurate hipfire than the baseline marksman weapon values, so the G7 Scout will be less accurate in hipfire than these other weapons. Longbow Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15 Wingman Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15 Dev Note As we’ve done before when the Skullpiercer is out of the loot pool, we’re giving the Longbow and Wingman a compensatory buff. Mozambique Increased magazine capacity from 4 to 6 Moved the lower 2 pellets inward in the blast pattern Dev Note This brings up the baseline power level so “only” finding a Mozambique early in the match gives you more of a fighting chance, and makes up for the removal of Hammerpoints P2020 Increased bullet damage from 15 to 18 Lowered fire rate from 8.5 to 6.25 Dev Note Similar to the Mozambique, we want to bring up the P2020’s baseline power level a bit. Most players couldn’t take advantage of the fast fire rate, so bringing that down while increasing the damage should help players win more early fights with the P2020. Arc Stars Aim and movement slow removed from the initial stick. Dev Note Sticking someone should feel rewarding, considering it's a rare occurrence that's difficult to pull off. While an argument can be made that getting stuck should be a personal death sentence, the inability to at least relocate and spare teammates from the follow-up explosion makes it hard to counter against a coordinated team. This change should help mitigate that without stripping away the satisfaction of hitting a nice stick. Quality of Life Badges are now sorted by categories and can be filtered by “all” or “unlocked only”. This suggestion came directly from players. Thank you! It’s so much better! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/076b717b8fd4fe4214bb842c36ba479f66b2e84f.png When looting death boxes, players can now see health bars for everyone on the team. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/65ce0eb1761958545bcb6e9f5ab65329768d6340.png Challenges can now be “favorited” by going into the challenges menu and right clicking a challenge. That Challenge will then be added to a new favorites tab that will appear in the lobby and in the match’s map screen. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/9316a5087f7e59bef4862b95b9c46c2219aef7bf.png Pressing and Holding F2 while in-game will bring up the ability description page for your character. This is only available on PC. Players can now request better equipment by going into their inventory and pinging a piece of equipment. Your first Challenge Reroll of the day is now free. Rerolling your challenges will allow you to choose from either BR-focused challenges or Arenas-focused ones. Holo Sprays, Quips, and Emotes, can be favorited. These will be used whenever the player is prompted to do a random emote. Club Invites v2 - You can now include what you want to play when you send your clubmates a party invite via the Club tab. Select as many club mates as you want to send the invite to at once via the member list. Ranked: Fixed edge cases where an abandon penalty would be incorrectly applied due to server errors. Flight path adjustments: Removing edge dropship flight paths to prevent matches where large portions of the map receive little to no traffic. These screenshots show a before/after comparison of possible flight paths on Kings Canyon. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/4709e1ea0102ca95117415f673da9b0c6443c334.png Ring Update We're continuing work from the Fight Night update to improve match pacing towards the end of the game. We're slowing down the closing speed of the late game Rings to allow you more time to fight and maneuver your way into the Ring. We're also reducing the \"waiting\" time before Rings 4 and 6 start to close. Ring 4 pre-shrink time reduced from 2:00 to 1:45 Ring 4 shrink speed reduced from 33 second close time to 40 seconds Ring 5 shrink speed reduced from 20 second close time to 40 seconds Ring 6 pre-shrink time reduced from 1:30 to 1:00 Ring 6 shrink speed reduced from 1:40 close time to 2:00 Bug Fixes Bloodhound Fixed an issue with the Tactical UI not showing while in Bloodhound’s Ultimate. Pathfinder Gas Traps and Jump Pads will no longer float into the sky when placed next to a zipline. Wraith Slight wall bumps no longer inadvertently cancel Wraith’s tactical. Mirage Decoys no longer die after a tick of thermite damage. Octane Ordinances will no longer get stuck and disappear when being bounced off of Jump Pads. Death Totems will no longer bounce when a Jump Pad is placed under it. Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the Fight Night ring via a Jump Pad. Updated Octane’s Helicopter emote to correctly remove his leg for which he is using it to do said helicoptering. Wattson Fixed the “Extend” prompt for Watson’s fences not appearing in certain situations. Haute Drop skin will no longer block view when reloading the Sentinel. Loba Fixed more areas where Loba’s Bracelet fails. Red Handed skin on consoles will now properly animate. Rampart Mobile Respawn Beacon now has proper collision with Amped Cover. Jumping on and off a damaged Shiela will no longer transfer the flame effect to your weapon. Horizon Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the fight night ring via a Gravity Lift. 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins. Fixed an issue with NEWT not getting refunded if it immediately dies due to a bad spot. Fuse 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins. Flatline Part of the iron sight was being displayed over the whole weapon. Prowler Supply Drop Prowler can now toggle fire modes. Sentinel Moved tool tips to not overlap hop up icons. Fixed a graphical issue when swapping to Sentinel. Misc. Fixed a menu issue with the advanced look options being hidden. Survey beacons will now appear on the map when teammates are respawned. ",

As one of the original legends in the game, and thanks to his protective and brotherly nature, Apex players have taken to the gentle giant. Plus, it helps that he's pretty useful in-game as well - ranking highly on our Apex Legends tier list and featuring in the majority of ALGS teams. However, as Apex Legends Season 9 introduces ground emotes which further display characters' personalities - Bloodhound has some raven troubles, and Loba plays golf with Revenant's head, for instance - Gibraltar's emote has come under fire. Māori gamer Taikawa 'Teebagginz_' Tamati-Elliffe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Teebagginz_/status/1387886637925896193\">tweeted</a> saying that \" better have some form of cultural consultation cos that's shit if you're ripping off my proud heritage, identity and culture.\" Many problems arise from the fact that Gibraltar's heritage is non-specific. Fan wikis say that he is from the Pacific Islands, which his gear seems to draw inspiration from, but that he is not specifically Polynesian, Māori, or Samoan. However, this is not referenced, and Gibraltar's official description on the EA website only mentions his fictional home world of Solace. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gibraltar-haka\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-animal-kingdom-skins\">Apex Legends' new skins will help grow the ALGS Championship prize pool</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-kill-points\">Top Apex Legends pros want kill points removed from ranked</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/avangard-gll-ban\">Apex Legends team Avangard stripped of GLL title two weeks after victory</a> ",

        "contents": "If you somehow missed it, earlier this week Respawn unveiled some massive changes coming to Apex Legends in its upcoming Legacy season - the biggest being a new permanent game mode called Arenas. Set to run alongside Apex's standard battle royale matches, Arenas has been described as the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-26-apex-legends-unveils-3v3-arenas-mode-the-first-step-in-going-beyond-battle-royale\">\"first step\" in moving Apex Legends beyond battle royale</a>. And as it turns out, the first pitch document for Arenas was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pinedsman/status/1386734505801617412?s=20\">inspired by Auto Chess</a>: a pretty surprising choice given that battle royales and auto chess, erm, aren't particularly alike. It all made me wonder what sort of wacky experiments Respawn is carrying out behind the scenes, and what we could potentially see next. Could it be single-player modes, co-op, gauntlet runs? So I decided to put this question to Respawn in an interview with chief operating manager and Apex Legends general manager Dusty Welch, and game director Chad Grenier. It seems that the Apex Legends team is keen to venture further into areas such as PvE - and pointed to previous Apex experiments as an example. \"We dipped our toes in a PvE mode a few seasons back with quests,\" Grenier said. \"And the team certainly loves to make that kind of content. A lot of our team comes from a single-player background... we made the single-player campaign in Titanfall 2. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-29-respawn-would-love-to-deliver-more-single-player-pve-content-for-apex-legends\">Read more</a> ",

As revealed in developer Respawn's <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-19-apex-legends-reveals-new-legend-valkyrie\">recent Stories from the Outlands video</a>, Kairi \"Valkyrie\" Imahara is the daughter of Titanfall 2 antagonist Viper. By the time we meet her in Apex Legends, Valkyrie has fashioned herself a fancy jetpack using the flight core from her father's Titan, Northstar, to honour his memory - and it's this that informs most of her unique abilities. Valkyrie's passive ability, for instance, comes in the form of VTOL Jets, which give her the power of flight for as long as the fuel tank holds out (although, luckily, it'll refill over time). That's accompanied by Valkyrie's Missile Swarm tactical ability, which can target a specific area and fire off a barrage of mini-rockets capable of damaging and disorientating opponents. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-29-apex-legends-breaks-down-new-hero-and-winged-avenger-valkyrie-in-abilities-trailer\">Read more</a> ",

We’re going beyond Battle Royale with Arenas, introducing a new Legend (Valkyrie), as well as new Arenas maps, an Olympus map update, and much more. Click the video down below to watch. New for Apex Legends: Legacy Arenas {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/f886ff925edc9363f2c80bfecf8342fa26a547a5.png The Games are going underground with the introduction of a new permanent mode: Arenas. Fully reassembled and unimpressed with the glitz and glamor of the Apex Games, former Apex Predator Ash is taking the competition back to its roots. A purer form of combat. The rules are simple: 3-versus-3. Eliminate your enemies to win the round. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You win, or you die. Arenas features a new set of custom maps, tailor-made for close-quarters combat (with more to come in the future). Squads start each round in a spawn room, where they can get weapons, gear, and abilities, and adjust their loadout as their strategy changes. The first team to win three rounds with at least a two-point lead will be crowned the victor—unless they battle to a four-four tie. Then they’ll have the honor of participating in Ash’s favorite part of the game: Sudden Death. For more on Arenas, check out the blog for a full deep dive into the new mode. Party Crasher Short version, Mirage took the voyage on a joyride and it didn’t go as planned. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/e4421c8892cc85f1dbcf4f25d22ddb1628684c28.png Party Crasher is one of two exciting custom arenas where you’ll be able to show off your skills. This arena takes place in a ritzy, downtown plaza where players can choose to engage on the crashed Mirage Voyage, or the opulent two story buildings that make up the downtown. Stay vigilante, as this map hosts a variety of engagement distances—both close quarters and long distance. Phase Runner The Phase Runner on Olympus is unique, but it wasn’t the first of its kind. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/75fe2134ad58fa8a9e104a885374d4ee7e319b56.png Phase Runner is the second of our custom arenas, and our largest. You’ll fight in a hidden, experimental zone at the peak of a mountain where a prototype phase runner lays for use. This map gives you a lot of space to maneuver, so be sure to be on the lookout for those who prefer to be patient and take you out from afar. Sound tactics and clear communication are what you’ll need to come out on top as you fight through the construction site or near the phase runner exit. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d55bf59e2f9274957762c2bb16385ece20d83b4b.png In addition to the two new maps, other areas from our three BR maps will be thrown into a bi-weekly rotation, giving you five maps total for Arenas. At the start you’ll get Artillery from Kings Canyon, Thermal Station from World’s Edge, and Golden Gardens from Olympus. Valkyrie Kairi Imahara, the daughter of Apex Predator Viper, salvaged the remains of her father's Northstar Titan years after his death. With Rampart's help, she fashioned it into a sleek new jetpack that honors her family’s legacy. Now, she’s entered the Games under the name VALKYRIE. Passive: VTOL Jets Use your jetpack to reposition or reach high places. You have limited fuel and cannot use weapons while flying. Tactical: Missile Swarm Fire a swarm of mini-rockets which damage and disorient the enemy. Ultimate: Skyward dive Take to the skies to reposition a long distance across the map. Your squadmates can join in. Class: Recon Scanning Survey Beacons reveals the next circle’s location. Bocek {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/25a237af66c2de325db04172e8797c04b7be3815.png The new Bocek (pronounced bow-check) compound bow is a precision marksman weapon that rewards a skilled and confident hand. Holding down fire will draw the bow over a short time, increasing the power of the shot, with maximum power giving optimal damage and projectile speed. Repeatedly firing the Bocek right as it reaches max power provides the best sustained damage. The Bocek uses a new ammo type, Arrows, which are unique to this weapon. Arrows are more rare on the battlefield, but fired arrows will stick into surfaces and remain in the world for players to pick back up and reuse. The 1x hcog classic, 1x holosight, 2x hcog, 1x-2x variable, and 3x hcog optics can all be equipped. The Bocek can also be further modified with the two new hop-ups entering the game, Shatter Caps and Deadeye’s Tempo; it can even equip both hop-ups simultaneously! Olympus - The Lost Fleet Update {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/acfae18491f78f1c10a6a76afcef71e46eb940cb.png A fleet of mysterious ships have made their way to Olympus and brought with them an otherworldly, parasitic plant that has begun to take root along the surface. The lead ship, The Icarus, has docked with the city and changed the landscape for good. Fight through the claustrophobic halls of the ghost ship, search corpses for a mysterious key card, and walk away as the last squad standing. Read our latest map update blog to get a detailed look at what’s changed on Olympus. To allow everyone to see the latest map update, Olympus will be the only map in rotation for the first week of the new season. Starter Kit and Loot Changes {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d5cd455de63650fd85154849d8269963685bad39.png Players will now start a match with a “Starter Kit” consisting of a Level 1 EVO Shield, Helmet, and Knockdown Shield, plus two Shield Cells and Syringes each. We’ve removed Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the loot pool. Spawn chances for Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool have been significantly reduced. Along with the lowered or removed spawn chances for these items, we’ve rebalanced the loot pool such that higher-level versions of these items will appear nearly the same as they do now, but other item types will appear more often (weapons, ordinance, health, ammo, etc.) Dev note We've wanted to take a crack at improving the loot game for a while, with our design goals being to make picking up loot feel more impactful to the game, and to thin out our loot a bit in general, since we're always adding new items to the pool. The recent Locked & Loaded takeover mode helped us field-test some of the changes we're looking to make moving forward: certain pieces of loot, and low-tier loot types specifically, are being put on notice. We're removing Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the ground loot because these seemed like the least exciting, least meaningful equipment pickups we had. Their power is practically invisible, so they don't really feel like a character improvement in the way that things like, say, a Backpack feels (getting those extra slots feels SO chunky!). We're keeping Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool (albeit at a lower spawn chance) in addition to adding them to your starter kit because having them sprinkled around is still important for \"shield-swapping\" shenanigans. Finally, granting these pieces of gear from the start of the game is also intended to improve the \"hot drop\" situation: having more health, some headshot damage reduction, and a little knockdown protection can help give players some more time to react to a chaotic hot drop than before. Be on the lookout for more loot changes in the future! This will be an ongoing project. Emotes Introducing Emotes! Every Legend will have one emote unlocked at launch and additional emotes can be obtained through Apex packs or by crafting them. Equip your emotes to the emote wheel and flex away! It’s great fun to show off to your squadmates in the starting room of Arenas, and of course you have to use them on the Winner’s podium. Now, since emotes kick your camera back to a third-person view, we know some folks are already thinking about corner peeking. Competitive integrity is still paramount, so enemies that your character couldn’t see in first-person view will not be shown while you are in third person. This video shows the “Anti-Peek” feature working on the purple Dummie behind the rock. Without it, Pathfinder would be able to use the 3rd person camera to gain knowledge that he shouldn’t have. All emotes have Anti-Peek enabled and there is no way to disable it. Battlepass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c0d00952e6602718b5545a53279b83e1aae8a078.jpg Unlock the premium Legacy Battle Pass and level it up to unlock new skins like Rampart’s Crafty Kitsune at Premium Level 25 and Wraith’s Demon’s Whisper at Premium Level 50. Legend Updates Low Profile Characters Low profile no longer exists! This trait has been removed from Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson. Dev Note After our successful experiment with Wraith's hitboxes, we are now confident that we can solve balance issues between smaller and larger Legends through changes to their kits and hitboxes. It is finally time for Low Profile to go the way of the dodo. (Sorry dodos.) Lifeline Combat Revive: No longer deploys a shield. Can now revive two players at the same time. Can now cancel active revives in progress to allow your teammate to defend themselves with their knockdown shield. D.O.C. Heal Drone: Heal rate increased from 5hp per second to 8hp per second. Deployment time before healing begins reduced by roughly 33%. Care Package: Cooldown reduced from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. Now guarantees an upgrade (if possible) in three categories: Body Shield, Other Equipment (Helmet, Backpack, and Knockdown Shield), and Weapon Attachment, based on your team’s current gear when the Package arrives. Dev Note Lifeline’s kit was not in a particularly healthy place. The Passive shield was extremely strong to the point of frustration, while her Tactical and Ultimate seemed like they were becoming more and more obsolete. These changes are aimed to redistribute this big power differential between all of her abilities, making D.O.C. and Care Package more powerful and effective, while tamping down on the highly binary and situational Combat Revive. Octane Stim: Reduced cooldown between stims from 4s to 1s. Increased health cost from 12hp to 20hp Increased bullet spread while in the air and shooting from the low Launch Pad trajectory. Dev Note Octane continues to perform really well after the latest changes. Too well? We still love the frequency of the Jump Pad, but we’d like to make using Stim something Octane thinks about doing at the right time, instead of always slamming it by default. Loba Burglar's Best Friend: Can now run and slide at full speed while aiming the bracelet and while the bracelet is in the air. Loba will no longer be slowed after translocating. Fixed a lot of bugs that caused bracelet tosses to fail. Black Market Boutique: Increased cooldown from 90s to 120s. Horizon Gravity Lift: Reduced lift speed by 30%. Reduced side-to-side acceleration. Limited the time you can sit at the top of Gravity Lift to 2 seconds. Increased cooldown from 15s to 20s. Horizon’s abilities will now get zapped by Wattson pylons. Dev Note Horizon is powerful and popular, but that's not why we're making these changes. We believe that mistakes in Apex Legends should be punishable, and when Horizon could just get herself out of bad positioning while popping a whole battery, this just wasn't true. These changes have two goals: 1) make it much more possible for enemies to shoot Horizon as she sits in her gravity lift and 2) make gravity lift less of an impromptu sniper tower. Fuse Knuckle Cluster: Fuse now has two stacks of Knuckle Cluster. Reduced cooldown from 25s to 20s. Dev Note More help is coming, but we want to be very careful how we buff him so that he doesn't just become the Legend that kills you with his abilities. Bangalore Smoke Launcher: Thickened Bangalore’s smoke. Dev Note Last patch we optimized Bangalore’s smoke particles and inadvertently thinned them out. This aims to get her back to the original visuals while keeping the optimizations. Bloodhound No longer receives assists from Eye of the Allfather. Dev Note Bloodhound's scan is strong, but the goal of this change in particular is to reconsider assists and their implications for Ranked Points. There's enough intrinsic value in sonar scans, and it's a slippery slope to consider crediting assists for other non-damaging abilities. Crypto will remain an exception. The active nature of Crypto's drone scan is notably different from the passive option with Bloodhound. This should encourage Bloodhound players to act on the information they get from the scan, to eliminate instances where they might try to snag a quick assist without committing to a fight in the same way Crypto has to. Crypto Crypto's drone can now scan and open care packages. Can no longer use his drone to \"hijack\" a respawn beacon that's already in use. Weapons Updates Marksman Weapon Category {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/2fe89a31156d112fa4ad6631b001985b3a3138c0.png The G7 Scout and the 30-30 are currently in the Assault Rifle weapons category, but they are a bit strange in that category due to their firing style and some of their handling values. Similarly, the Triple Take felt a little out of place in the Sniper category. With the introduction of the Bocek bow, we felt it was a good time to introduce a new weapons category, Marksman Weapons, which will include the G7, 30-30, Triple Take, and Bocek. Weapons in this category are precision weapons that are most effective up to medium-long range, and are the sort of in-betweens of Assault Rifles and Snipers. This allows us to begin moving the settings of these weapons towards more consistent value for the class, and make the settings of ARs and Snipers more consistent with less outliers. For starters, we are increasing the movement speed while aiming down sights for marksman weapons; They were at sniper speeds, and will now be between sniper and AR speeds. Additionally, we have done some targeted normalization of hipfire spread amounts. Supply Drop Rotation {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/83c0c2aa85e69e7792e02d34cf86648301939f1b.png This season, we’re taking the Peacekeeper out of the supply drop and putting the Triple Take in its place. Of course, with any supply drop change, these weapons will have their stats updated. See how each weapon changes down below. Crate Weapon Drop Rates: Since we are exchanging a shotgun with a marksman weapon, now was a good time to rebalance the drop rates of crate weapons. The Kraber will spawn less often in the early game and more often in the mid game to better accommodate its power. The Triple Take will be the most common early game crate weapon, with the Prowler being the most prominent late game crate weapon. Fully Kitted Rotation {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/eb021e369b59c6aac5c99774f5b77e15b35d33c4.png Added: Wingman, Bocek, R99, Hemlock, and Sentinel Removed: R301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, and Spitfire Hop Ups Shatter Caps - Fire select to toggle between standard mode and shatter mode. In shatter mode, rounds split into a blast pattern on firing. This hop up will be equipable to the 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek. Deadeye’s Tempo - Firing at the perfect moment increases fire rate. This can currently be attached to the Sentinel and the Bocek. To make room, the Hammerpoint and Skullpiercer hop ups are being vaulted for now, and won’t be available. Assault Rifles Reducing the headshot multiplier for all assault rifles from 2.0 to 1.75 Dev Note This was already the case for the Hemlok, so the affected guns are the R301, Flatline, and Havoc. Peacekeeper It comes with the Precision Choke by default, which can be toggled off Pellet damage reduced from 10 to 9 Rechamber time increased from 0.9 seconds to 1.1 seconds Reload times increased (regular from 2.45 to 2.5, empty from 3.35 to 3.5) Pellet spread increased in general, and spread when charged increased for all charge levels (from 0.65/0.45/0.2 to 0.85/0.65/0.35) Quickly loses charge after leaving ADS Dev Note Since the Peacekeeper is coming out of the crate, we are bringing many of the stats back in line with their previous values. We are also reducing its damage potential and bringing in the effective range a bit since the Precision Choke is always available now. Triple Take As a crate weapon, it will come with a 9 ammo clip and 63 reserve ammo Fire rate increased from 1.2 to 1.3 Time to full charge reduced from 1.1 seconds to 1 second Retains charge briefly after leaving ADS Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased spread while airborne and aiming down sights Havoc Increased recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note This should help make up for the reduced headshot multiplier and make it a bit more usable in mid-range fights. Spitfire Reduced recoil controllability early in the pattern Dev Note The Spitfire is too strong at the moment, boasting good damage output with low recoil. Making it a bit harder to control early in the pattern should give more time for opponents to fight against it. That said, we’re prepared to make more changes to the Spitfire if it remains too powerful. 30-30 Repeater Increased leg damage multiplier from 0.75 to 0.85 Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs Dev Note The 30-30 could use some love, so we’re bringing up the amount of leg damage it does. This should make it a bit more consistent without raising it’s high “best case” damage potential. G7 Scout Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs Increased hipfire spread size (reduced accuracy) to be more in line with other marksman weapons Dev Note The 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek Compound Bow have more accurate hipfire than the baseline marksman weapon values, so the G7 Scout will be less accurate in hipfire than these other weapons. Longbow Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15 Wingman Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15 Dev Note As we’ve done before when the Skullpiercer is out of the loot pool, we’re giving the Longbow and Wingman a compensatory buff. Mozambique Increased magazine capacity from 4 to 6 Moved the lower 2 pellets inward in the blast pattern Dev Note This brings up the baseline power level so “only” finding a Mozambique early in the match gives you more of a fighting chance, and makes up for the removal of Hammerpoints P2020 Increased bullet damage from 15 to 18 Lowered fire rate from 8.5 to 6.25 Dev Note Similar to the Mozambique, we want to bring up the P2020’s baseline power level a bit. Most players couldn’t take advantage of the fast fire rate, so bringing that down while increasing the damage should help players win more early fights with the P2020. Arc Stars Aim and movement slow removed from the initial stick. Dev Note Sticking someone should feel rewarding, considering it's a rare occurrence that's difficult to pull off. While an argument can be made that getting stuck should be a personal death sentence, the inability to at least relocate and spare teammates from the follow-up explosion makes it hard to counter against a coordinated team. This change should help mitigate that without stripping away the satisfaction of hitting a nice stick. Quality of Life Badges are now sorted by categories and can be filtered by “all” or “unlocked only”. This suggestion came directly from players. Thank you! It’s so much better! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/076b717b8fd4fe4214bb842c36ba479f66b2e84f.png When looting death boxes, players can now see health bars for everyone on the team. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/65ce0eb1761958545bcb6e9f5ab65329768d6340.png Challenges can now be “favorited” by going into the challenges menu and right clicking a challenge. That Challenge will then be added to a new favorites tab that will appear in the lobby and in the match’s map screen. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/9316a5087f7e59bef4862b95b9c46c2219aef7bf.png Pressing and Holding F2 while in-game will bring up the ability description page for your character. This is only available on PC. Players can now request better equipment by going into their inventory and pinging a piece of equipment. Your first Challenge Reroll of the day is now free. Rerolling your challenges will allow you to choose from either BR-focused challenges or Arenas-focused ones. Holo Sprays, Quips, and Emotes, can be favorited. These will be used whenever the player is prompted to do a random emote. Club Invites v2 - You can now include what you want to play when you send your clubmates a party invite via the Club tab. Select as many club mates as you want to send the invite to at once via the member list. Ranked: Fixed edge cases where an abandon penalty would be incorrectly applied due to server errors. Flight path adjustments: Removing edge dropship flight paths to prevent matches where large portions of the map receive little to no traffic. These screenshots show a before/after comparison of possible flight paths on Kings Canyon. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/4709e1ea0102ca95117415f673da9b0c6443c334.png Ring Update We're continuing work from the Fight Night update to improve match pacing towards the end of the game. We're slowing down the closing speed of the late game Rings to allow you more time to fight and maneuver your way into the Ring. We're also reducing the \"waiting\" time before Rings 4 and 6 start to close. Ring 4 pre-shrink time reduced from 2:00 to 1:45 Ring 4 shrink speed reduced from 33 second close time to 40 seconds Ring 5 shrink speed reduced from 20 second close time to 40 seconds Ring 6 pre-shrink time reduced from 1:30 to 1:00 Ring 6 shrink speed reduced from 1:40 close time to 2:00 Bug Fixes Bloodhound Fixed an issue with the Tactical UI not showing while in Bloodhound’s Ultimate. Pathfinder Gas Traps and Jump Pads will no longer float into the sky when placed next to a zipline. Wraith Slight wall bumps no longer inadvertently cancel Wraith’s tactical. Mirage Decoys no longer die after a tick of thermite damage. Octane Ordinances will no longer get stuck and disappear when being bounced off of Jump Pads. Death Totems will no longer bounce when a Jump Pad is placed under it. Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the Fight Night ring via a Jump Pad. Updated Octane’s Helicopter emote to correctly remove his leg for which he is using it to do said helicoptering. Wattson Fixed the “Extend” prompt for Watson’s fences not appearing in certain situations. Haute Drop skin will no longer block view when reloading the Sentinel. Loba Fixed more areas where Loba’s Bracelet fails. Red Handed skin on consoles will now properly animate. Rampart Mobile Respawn Beacon now has proper collision with Amped Cover. Jumping on and off a damaged Shiela will no longer transfer the flame effect to your weapon. Horizon Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the fight night ring via a Gravity Lift. 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins. Fixed an issue with NEWT not getting refunded if it immediately dies due to a bad spot. Fuse 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins. Flatline Part of the iron sight was being displayed over the whole weapon. Prowler Supply Drop Prowler can now toggle fire modes. Sentinel Moved tool tips to not overlap hop up icons. Fixed a graphical issue when swapping to Sentinel. Misc. Fixed a menu issue with the advanced look options being hidden. Survey beacons will now appear on the map when teammates are respawned. ",

        "contents": "Server issues have always been a bit of a hot topic within the Apex Legends community, with players highlighting problems with lag, code:net errors and - more recently - <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-26-top-ranked-apex-legends-players-banned-for-using-ddos-attacks-to-win-games\">DDoS attacks on ranked servers</a>. To address all these concerns, Respawn has now published a developer deep dive aiming to \"demystify\" some of the problems, and explain what the team is doing to address them. You might want to put the kettle on, as this one's a long read. Written by lead engineer Samy \"Ricklesauceur\" Duc, the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/servers-netcode-developer-deep-dive\">blog post</a> notes that Respawn has made some changes to how it tracks server issues. The introduction of a performance display in Season 6 meant players could report their problems more accurately, and Respawn also began tracking key performance metrics for players and servers. In recent seasons, Respawn also used a data science team to systematically analyse performance data. But despite all this, Duc said this approach means Respawn can still be slow to fix problems. \"From the moment you start noticing problems, it may take us up to two weeks to find a fix, and even more to deploy the solution if it requires a server patch,\" Duc said. \"We can do better. We will do better. So let's talk about solutions.\" <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-29-respawn-discusses-apex-legends-server-issues-in-mammoth-blog-post\">Read more</a> ",

One poor soul was betrayed by their squadmates and used by another team to farm kills: effectively trapping them in an endless death loop. Reddit user \"MohSSEEZZ\" posted a clip of a diamond ranked game in which their random squadmates stood by and allowed them to be brutally murdered by another team. At this point MohSSEZZ's teammates collected their banner, respawned them, and allowed them to be murdered by the other team once again. MohSSEZZ said they were killed and respawned three times before eventually deciding to leave the ranked game. The reason why this is particularly bad is that Apex Legends penalises you for leaving a ranked game early, so MohSSEZZ had to choose between an infinite death loop or taking an abandonment penalty. It seems they eventually decided on the latter, and MohSSEEZZ said they \"got a ban for leaving the game I didn't wanna give them more points\". <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-28-ranked-apex-legends-player-gets-stuck-in-death-loop-after-teammates-betray-them-to-farm-kills\">Read more</a> ",

SolaFide owner Colin 'Oddity' Ethan has been <a href=\"https://lolesports.com/article/competitive-ruling-solafide-esports/blt057288d4bbbadf03\">banned from Riot-sanctioned leagues and events</a> indefinitely after failing to pay the organisation's League of Legends players, coaches, and management staff since January 1, 2021. This means that SolaFide cannot compete in Riot tournaments unless the team changes ownership. Even if it does so, it can only apply for reinstatement for a league position in 2024 at the earliest. According to Riot, Oddity assured team members that the initial delay to their January pay was due to a \"banking issue,\" but players and staff grew increasingly concerned as they also did not receive their payment for February's work. At this point, Oddity sent the team members a message to say they would be paid within 72 hours, but again this did not happen. Furthermore, he did not make requested \"good faith\" payments to two team members who desperately needed money. As well as unpaid wages, SolaFide team members did not receive their prize winnings from the Risen Champions League tournament. Four out of SolaFide's five players were registered on league-recognised contracts on the Global Contract Database, which have been contravened by the team's non-payment. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/league-of-legends/sola-fide-oddity-ban\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/banned-no-reason-issue\">Apex Legends bug that banned players for no reason reportedly fixed</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bocek-bow\">Apex Legends Bocek bow: stats, hop-ups, and attachments</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in patch 1.68</a> ",

However, the Valorant and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive-inspired team shooter will live and die by its competitive integrity. In such a finely-balanced environment, subtle tweaks to weapon prices or legend abilities could impact gameplay far more than in the battle royale mode. Respawn has <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/arenas-ranked\">recently shared how Arenas ranks will work</a>, including its MMR system and what sorts of rewards we can expect to pick up from climbing the ladder. The ranks take a similar form to the battle royale variant of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a>, but there is also clear inspiration from the games that Arenas feels more akin to - Valorant and CS:GO. While Apex Legends Arenas started life as a casual mode, Respawn has now honed competitive.

A veteran of Halo and Gears of War broadcasts, he has more recently turned his voice to the battle royale genre with the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends competitive tournaments. Whether he's hosting or shoutcasting, Falloutt quickly became a staple of the Apex Legends Global Series, to the extent that it would now be strange to see a broadcast without his trademark analysis. From early LAN events to the absurdity that can come with online play, he's seen it all and has been with fans for the entire journey through Apex Legends esports. Whether you're looking for advice on how to climb the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a> ladder or just to improve your public match plays, Falloutt's ALGS analysis will help anyone from noob to pro player. We chatted with Falloutt by email to understand what he loves about competitive Apex Legends, how he coped with the stress of tackling four or five different roles during the infamous Winter Circuit broadcast, and what he's hoping for in the future - looking to the ALGS Championship and beyond. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/falloutt-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gibraltar-haka\">Apex Legends' new Gibraltar emote raises cultural appropriation concerns</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/report-stalking-smurfing\">Apex Legends datamine uncovers options to report smurfing and stalking</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/dazs-interview\">Casting, producing, and 4am starts: behind the curtain of Dazs' Apex Legends broadcasts</a> ",

An Apex Predator-standard player, who has competed in the Apex Legends Global Series on numerous occasions and goes by the formidable moniker of the 'solo-queue warlord,' Shiv is known for his ability to beam enemies as well as his tirades against cheaters and stream snipers. It seems likely that he was targeted in order to provoke one such tirade, but a hacker - possibly a cheater who goes by the name of 'Tufi' - has been regularly locking Shiv out of his account, forcing him to create new accounts every time he plays a new match.

The animation tells the story of how she experimented with flying a titan at a young age, and had to be bailed out by her father when she accidentally steered herself into battle. IMC commander Kuben Blisk also makes an appearance, and gets his whisky glass shot for his troubles. The video ends with a shot of Rampart modifying the remains of Viper's Northstar titan for Valkyrie, which will be the focus of the new legend's abilities. The image shared on <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/legacy\">Respawn's website</a> suggests the modified titan will provide Valkyrie with missiles and some form of aerial manoeuvrability.

The Finals went on for an astonishing 11 rounds before TSM was crowned the victor, and despite the match point system needing tweaks - as <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-commissioner-interview\">ALGS commissioner John Nelson told us last week</a> - the Preseason Invitational was considered a success. \"That was a great opportunity to tell the story , because we had everybody there,\" explains EA's head of broadcast, Joe Lynch. \"We could show all the players, we could show that emotion. When 789 was making their big runs out of nowhere, we could actually interview them, talk to them, and see the expression when they got finished. Or when TSM won the whole thing, we could see that excitement in them and we could tell that emotional story. That was a good start.\" Lynch's most challenging task when broadcasting a battle royale tournament is simple: \"How do you tell the story?\" When he works on the broadcasts for other EA titles, things are much more simple.

Shields regenerate in Shield Regen, round time is reduced whenever a Legend dies in Killing Time, automatically retrieve fallen banners in Auto Banners, compete for top loot in Ultra Zones, and get a free respawn in Second Chance. WAR GAMES TAKEOVERS SECOND CHANCE We’re kicking things off with a bang on April 13th with our first modifier: Second Chance. In this modifier, each Legend is granted one free respawn per match. Once a Legend is killed, their Respawn Token is consumed as they rise again from their current location retaining all their weapons and gear. After a short duration, the player respawns high in the air to skydive back into the action. Note that, while Second Chance is active, Players will be unable to Unlock Assassin, Wake, or Wrath badges, since these prestigious badges would be far easier to unlock in this mode. ULTRA ZONES Then we shake up your ideal drop strategy with Ultra Zones! Ultra Zones introduce the concept of multiple Hot Zones within a single map. More epic loot, more gold items! But wait, there’s more! Each Hot Zone is enveloped in a Flash Point—a returning feature from a Season 6 LTM. For those who don’t already know, Flash Points are enormous, glowing bubbles that replenish your HP and shields when you stand in them. In this mode, consumable items are still available as normal throughout the loot pool. AUTO BANNERS Tune-in mid event for Auto Banners. In this modifier we’ve made a rather small but spicy change to squadmate respawning. Your Squadmates Banner Cards are automatically retrieved! No need to loot their death box to retrieve their Banner Cards, just head straight to a respawn beacon. The loot pool has been altered to contain more Mobile Respawn Beacons too. KILLING TIME Feel the pressure with Killing Time. This event speeds up the match as Legends fall. During a round, whenever a Legend dies, the round time is reduced. If any given round is a massacre, you can bet that ring will be closing real quick! Keep an eye on the round timer and the ring in this modifier. ARMOR REGEN We’re closing out the event with Armor Regen. That’s right: your armor regenerates over time at a rate of 12 points per second. Whenever you take damage, your armor will begin regenerating after an 8-second delay. This delay is doubled to 16 seconds if your armor gets cracked. One last thing for this mode: there are no Shield Cells in the loot pool! Modifier Schedule All modes begin and end during mornings, PT time. Second Chance: Tuesday, 4/13 – Thursday, 4/15 Ultra Zones: Thursday, 4/15 – Monday, 4/19 Auto Banners: Monday, 4/19 – Wednesday, 4/21 Killing Time: Wednesday, 4/21 – Friday, 4/23 Armor Regen: Friday, 4/23 – Tuesday, 4/27 As you can see, each takeover mode only lasts for a few days at most. We can’t wait to hear which ones are your favorites.",

However, here's how this unique mode worked, which will come in handy should it return in the future. Apex Legends Arenas mode was officially added in Season 9 to great reception, changing up the battle royale with a fast-paced deathmatch mode in small maps. However, it didn't quite pan out and Arenas was removed from Apex Legends in Season 16 to be replaced by a more traditional team deathmatch mode. As Apex Legends is one of the<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-battle-royale-game\"> best battle royale games</a>, this was undeniably a risky move, and one that unfortunately didn't pay off.

Dark Horse also published Pathfinder's Quest - a hefty tome which filled out a lot of gaps in the Apex Legends lore - last month.

According to Boggs, Apex Legends will run at 720p when docked and 576p in handheld, with a frame-rate of 30FPS in both modes. Given that the Switch port will come with cross-play, some players have expressed concerns that Switch players will be at a disadvantage against other platforms (particularly given the game is capped at 60FPS on console and 144FPS on PC, with ways to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/jozyft/apex_on_steam_capped_at_144_fps/\">get around the latter</a>). As detailed in the Famitsu interview there will be an option to disable cross-play, so you can choose whether to pool with other Switch users or give yourself a real challenge against PC and console.

NINTENDO SWITCH LAUNCH https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg On Tuesday, March 9th, Apex Legends is launching on Switch with support for cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game. Since we’re launching a few weeks after the start of Season 8, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their Season 8 Battle Pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP. Plus, to celebrate Switch players and welcome them to the arena, we’re also launching a Legendary Pathfinder skin (called P.A.T.H.) as a free reward for players who boot up Apex Legends on Switch between the game’s launch and the end of Season 8 - Mayhem (May 4th, 2021). CAUSTIC TOWN TAKEOVER When life gives you lemons, you can count on Caustic to turn it into toxic lemonade. Breathe it in at the all-new Caustic Treatment; a new dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all Legends who seek the glorious cheese. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-caustic-takeover.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Where Water Treatment once stood, the new Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? Forever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires “test subjects” to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-chambers.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg If you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment really killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No one’s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it. RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT Ring Fury is a new Apex playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, one or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. Those who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round’s Ring. You’ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. Legends will call out if they are in direct danger or if there’s one opening up nearby. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-18-ringfury-ring-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg So how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, two ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a new item we’re introducing called Heat Shields. HEAT SHIELDS During the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares (or from the ring itself!) and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-20-heatshield-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Heat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling Legends to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you’re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by 50% and the speed of Revives is increased by 25%. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and don't grant this bonus. But watch out: The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it’s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don’t expect it to last very long in the final rounds. After the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the game as general ground loot. SURVIVAL SLOT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-survival-slot.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg You’ll notice that the Heat Shield doesn't take up any of your normal inventory slots—instead, it resides in the brand new “Survival Slot”. The Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there’s no reason not to carry one of these around. Coordinate with your team, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars! Like the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the game even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS Like previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the two-week duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected. However, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an “Escalation Takeover,” which means that every few days during the event, we’re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting! Good luck out there. NO-FILL MATCHMAKING TL;DR: No-Fill Matchmaking is a new way to play the game as a solo Legend. Here’s how it works, and why you might choose to use it. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-crossplay.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg In the lobby, you’ll now see a checkbox entitled “Fill Matchmaking”. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the game has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you play. Unchecking this box and clicking Play will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your team with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with “Fill Matchmaking” unchecked, you’ll go in alone. You’ll be on a team of one, against teams of three. We still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay. But we’re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way. Here’s some things you might want to use No-Fill Matchmaking for: Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights Challenge yourself—can you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios? Experience the latest lore teaser on your own Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven’t tried before; Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the game at your own pace. We have some limitations in place for No-Fill matchmaking, because we don’t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the game for other players. We only allow six potential No-Fill players in any match, and the feature isn’t available in Ranked. Give it a shot and let us know what you think. CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK It ain’t a Collection Event without new unlockables. Let’s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with all-new earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and EVA-8 weapon skins among the goodies. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg You can earn 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once. And of course, Chaos Theory also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, event-limited cosmetics. Inspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our Legends are donning fierce new looks as they drop into the arena. All 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you’ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. Bangalore took this Pilot’s knife off a cold-blooded opponent. Since that day, she’s made it her own. After the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. A few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work: First, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended. Second, each Event Pack will come with one event item and two non-event items at the following drop rates: https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2020/09/apex-inline-image-probability-aftermarket-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Other than that, it’s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Event-Limited Cosmetics work, visit our FAQ. LEGEND UPDATES Caustic Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from 2.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes. Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of 5hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6hp → 12hp. Dev note: Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It’s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can play in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage (without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead) seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these changes hit Caustic’s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly. Pathfinder Removed Low Profile Dev Note: Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile and/or small legends. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it’s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size. Gibraltar Removed 15% faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection. Horizon Increased Black Hole cooldown from 2 minutes to 3 minutes Revenant Revenant’s Silence now disables Mirage’s cloaked revive & respawn as well as Octane’s Swift Mend. Wattson Wattson now has passive shield regen at 0.5 hp/s (half of Octane’s current health regen rate). Rampart Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting 200 damage. Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting 175 damage. Dev Note: Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This wasn't necessary, as it turns out, so we're removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila. WEAPON UPDATE Weapon Optics All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to 2x Bruiser. Mastiff Pellet damage decreased from 13 → 11. Fire rate increased from 1.0 → 1.1. Dev Note: The goal of these changes are to place this weapon’s identity between the fast fire EVA-8 and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of two pumps players experience on the receiving end. Wingman +1 bullet to every magazine size, including base. Hemlok Increased hip-fire spread. Dev Note: The burst damage from the Hemlok's hip-fire was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok’s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Kings Canyon Loot - we’ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while also maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High. Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship. Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality. Locked Weapon Optic Swapping - For guns with fully locked attachment slots, like fully-kitted gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight. This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle. Assists have been added to the in-game HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been added to unranked. Assists still don’t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator “eye” icon. Assists and Knocks have been added to your squad’s banners and will show at the end of a match. Club names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. Items will no longer “stick” to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator. Badge Progress - for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you’re trying to get 50 wins as Lifeline, you’ll now see that you have 45 instead of somewhere between 15 and 50. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-badge-progress.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Ping My Deathbox - While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. Gold Backpack - Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of energy—based on the tier of armor they wear—while the revive is taking place. They will also display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress. Players on PC can now go back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the game. Added numbers to the Advanced Look Controls. This should help people experiment and easily revert back to their favorite settings. When scanning a beacon for Ring 6, you should now be able to see the location where Ring 6 finishes. Inspect Weapon - Since the Survival Slot took its button on controller (we only have so many buttons!), Inspect Weapon has been moved to the emote wheel by default. It can be bound to any key on PC. BUG FIXES Gibraltar Corrected an issue with Gibraltar not getting hit registrations when simultaneously releasing ADS and shooting while his Gun Shield was up Wraith Wraith players can no longer cancel Into the Void by jumping at a wall The New Skydive Emote will now work with Legendary Skins Caustic Fixed a bug that was causing Nox Gas to flicker for some players affected by it Octane Repeatedly using the same jump pad no longer disables double-jumps Players are no longer allowed to “glide” along a wall after using the jump pad Crypto Crypto’s animation to bring out his Drone is no longer skippable by throwing a holospray Crypto can no longer teleport to a replicator Reloading the Mastiff and 30-30 will no longer be faster while in Crypto’s drone Loba Fixed a few areas Loba could teleport into that would get her stuck Rampart Players can no longer use Sheila to get under the world when placed too close to the Phase Runner in Olympus Horizon Fixed the Gravity Lift falling through the floor when used on the train tracks in World’s Edge’s Sorting Factory Using a zipline after a Gravity Lift will no longer increase accuracy Fuse Motherload will now damage and destroy jump pads When under a small enclosure, players will no longer be pushed out after using Motherload Players can no longer double their grenades after looting a dead Fuse’s deathbox Mastiff Dropping and picking up the Mastiff will no longer cause it to be reloaded 3030 Repeater Dropping and picking up the 30-30 will no longer cause it to be reloaded 30-30 will now have spread deviation when ADS firing and jumping MISC Fixed a bug preventing Steam users from sending friend requests to each other Usernames now update when a user swaps between the Origin Client to the Steam Client Fixed a bug preventing players from creating or joining clubs due to their EA Account already being associated with another platform That’s all for now.

The news comes with the Chaos Theory Collection Event patch, which also brings Apex players a new item, a 'Survival Slot' in their inventory, an LTM, and an anticipated Caustic nerf. We'll start with the biggest news: you're now able to drop into Kings Canyon and Worlds Edge on your lonesome, with no teammates to back you up (or let you down). However, there's a catch, and the monkey's paw has curled, meaning that those choosing to attempt a solo battle royale victory will have to fend off whole teams of opponents. That's right, players who solo queue will be matchmade with full teams in Duos or Trios.

Even after developer Respawn extended the event by a week, it's all I can think about and all I want to play. Why? Well that's mostly down to the game's worst shotgun. Locked and Loaded sees players drop into Kings Canyon and Olympus armed with a complete level one set of equipment: helmet, Evo Shield, backpack, and knockdown shield as well as a Mozambique with grey shotgun bolt. Every other piece of level one equipment is also removed from the loot pool. The humble Mozambique - which sits very close to the bottom of our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list</a> - becomes your best friend, your trusted confidant, and your saviour.

        "contents": "It has been a whirlwind month for Apex Legends. Respawn's hit FPS game celebrated its second anniversary in style, ending February with 50,000 more concurrent players on Steam than it had at the beginning of the month. It also broke its peak player record over the weekend, with Steam Charts registering <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1172470\">a high of 196,799 players</a> on February 27. With this, the game has surpassed Team Fortress 2 and Grand Theft Auto V to sit in the <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/\">top five most-played games</a> on the platform. With the launch of Season 8: Mayhem, many have evidently found themselves enticed to either try out, or return to the free-to-play shooter. The game itself has continued to evolve since its launch, with Respawn eager to keep the experience fresh. Over the last couple of years we have seen maps come, go, and even return with major changes. Meanwhile, the game's roster of legends has doubled since launch, with each new character providing a slew of unique abilities. Speaking to The Loadout in a <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/evolution-interview\">previous interview</a>, concept art director Steve Ferreira even says the studio prefers to release a new legend on the stronger side in the hopes that it \"has a big splash and really shakes things up in the meta.\" Such are the lengths Respawn goes to in order to ensure no two seasons are the same. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/steam-record-february-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/overtime-comic-release-date\">Apex Legends: Overtime comic series set to release this summer</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/heat-shield-bug-fix\">That horrible noise in your Apex Legends matches should be going away today</a> ",

The interdimensional skirmisher has been a top-tier legend since the game released two years ago, but a recent hitbox nerf seems to be putting players off. Wraith's abilities allow her to teleport short distances and create portals for teammates to jump through, which are undoubtedly a powerful tool in the right hands. However, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Respawn increased the size of her hitbox in Season 8</a>, which seems to have impacted her usability. While she retained the Low Profile ability that makes her harder to hit, this seems to be a change too far for many players. While she still looks very strong (and retains her spot at the top of our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a>), being easier to hit can make a big difference in a firefight. Even a slight increase to her hitbox could prove devastating to her usefulness - as Pathfinder mains found out when his was nerfed last year. However, as Wraith's abilities so far remain unchanged, which was not the case for Pathy, we don't expect her fall from grace to be quite as dramatic as the loveable robot's. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/wraith-nerf-season-8\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/solos-no-fill\">Apex Legends is finally getting solos - sort of</a> ",

Locked and Loaded Takeover Another Takeover is hitting the normal Play Apex playlist. In “Locked and Loaded”, hit the ground with a full loadout of level 1 gear. You’ll have a Mozambique, White Shotgun Bolt, HCOG Classic Scope, White Evo Shield, White Helmet, White Backpack, White Knockdown Shield, two Syringes, two Shield Cells, and one stack of shotgun ammo. What more could you possibly need, right? All Common/White level attachments and equipment will also be removed from the loot pool (outside of Common scopes) during the takeover. Drop in and knock ’em out! Seasonal Challenges To continue the celebration, we’re giving you some fun challenges to go after with new badges to earn. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-collection-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Get the “Daily Discovery” Nessie Badge by completing 75 Daily Challenges “Respect your elders” and earn the Mozambique Badge by dealing 102,816 Damage (get the reference?)

If you’ve missed out on a skin you really wanted in the past, now’s the time to snag it, but with a new look that lets others know you were here in the early days of Apex Legends. Normally, unlocking all the items in a Collection Event unlocks a specific heirloom. But you only turn two once, so we’re mixing it up a little bit. Unlocking all items in the Collection Event will earn you 150 heirloom shards, so you can unlock any heirloom you want. And to make it a little bit easier to get there, for this one time only, the crafting cost for all items in the Collection Event has been reduced by 50%. For collectors looking to get the most bang for your buck, check out our Anniversary event bundles featuring the new content. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-badges.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg One last minor detail: If you earn Event Packs from the Reward Track after you’ve already unlocked everything in the Collection Event, those packs are still good. They’ll simply grant you 700 Apex Coins (their purchase cost). That’s all for now. But before we go, we want to say, again, thank you. The last two years has been incredible, and it’s all thanks to the community that has formed around this game. Here’s to two years, and to the future—the best is yet to come! See you in the Arena. ",

        "contents": "Hey everyone, I’m Chad Grenier, the game director of Apex Legends. I’ve been at Respawn since the studio’s formation in 2010 and have had the privilege to work on many great games, including Apex Legends from the very beginning. In just a few days we will be celebrating our two year anniversary so we’ve been doing some reflecting and reminiscing on how we’ve gotten to where we are today. I’d like to take a brief moment to share a bit of the story. ORIGIN STORY & LAUNCH https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-origin-story.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg After shipping Titanfall 2 we were hard at work on post-release Titanfall content and naturally starting to explore ideas for another game. Apex Legends wasn’t even a thought yet. We were discussing and trying new ideas, playtesting prototype campaign ideas, playing new game modes, and two designers started a small prototype that would change the course of our game. Almost two years before the release of Apex Legends, we had our first company-wide playtest on a new game mode called ‘Survival’ where pilots and Titans would fight it out to be the last man standing, battle royale style. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-survival-mode.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Early ‘survival’ game mode put 24 pilots into a drop ship where they would form teams of 3 by running to and entering the same droppod together https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-real-big-map.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Our prototype map called ‘real big map’ was quite different than Kings Canyon in that it was more sparse and allowed for Titans to roam freely Fast forward another month, and the team working on this new game mode had grown to over 20 people. In October of 2017 we saw the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith in game, in November of 2017 we did our first 50 player game successfully and had just begun playtesting on a map that would eventually be called Kings Canyon. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-featured-image-two-year-anniversary.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg\\ The earliest recognizable image of Kings Canyon. Before town names they were simply called zones The gameplay improved over time, with Titans and wallrunning being removed to slow down the pace of the game and bring more balance to the gameplay. Of course, we tried to keep Titans in the game for many months, but once we accepted that we were making something fundamentally different from Titanfall, we entered a new phase. Company playtests were happening weekly, and often running late into the night. We couldn’t stop playing! There was a leaderboard on the chalkboard in the kitchen showing who had the most wins. The company had become consumed with playing this new mode we were building. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-chalk-board.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg A chalkboard in the studio keeps track of ‘Friday Night Fights’ playtest winners The name of the game turned from “Survival” to “Apex Predator”. Kings Canyon became more like Kings Canyon we know today. We began prototyping new mechanics like respawning teammates and legend abilities. We would force the entire team to playtest without headsets, and with player names turned off, so we could build a best in class in-game communication system. It became clear to us that we had something great on our hands, and our plans for the other project were scrapped. We were then all-hands on what would eventually be called “Apex Legends” and would never look back. Of course, thinking you have a great game on your hands doesn’t mean the world will love what you’ve created so we were all very anxious to see how our game did at launch. Knowing that many of our fans would be expecting another traditional Titanfall game, we opted to go with a secret launch so players could immediately play the game when they first heard about it. We knew players would love the game if they could just play it. A few days before launch we held a private event in Los Angeles to show the game to top streamers, content creators, and media. After a presentation they got to play the game for two hours. Two hours turned into eight, and they didn’t want to put it down. The team was starting to become overwhelmed with excitement! https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-viewing.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-playtest.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg On Feb 4th, 2019 we would launch our game to the world's surprise. We hoped some players would download the game and love it, but also knew that creating a free-to-play game was more about longevity and building over time, as opposed to a blockbuster boxed game launch. I remember one of our live ops engineers (responsible for ensuring our servers work at scale) setting expectations and telling the team “Don’t expect a million players right out of the gate, or even within the first few months!” As the entire team stood in the kitchen staring at our projector screen we counted down together the seconds until the game launched. By the time the champagne toasts and cheers had settled down we already had tens of thousands of players in games! https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-1-million.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg Eight hours later while we’re still at work we hit a million players. We of course had to go give that live ops engineer some crap! Three days later, we stood in the same kitchen and counted down to 10 million players, and then 24 days after launch hit 50 million players. TOWARD AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE Since launch we’ve had eight season launches, over a dozen lore events paired with original video content and over a dozen major in-game events. We’ve added two new maps, vehicles, eight new legends, and countless other limited-time game modes and improvements to the game. The game continues to grow. Next month, we’ll launch on Nintendo Switch. Work on a mobile version of Apex Legends is well underway. And later this year, we’ll launch new ways to play the game that take us beyond battle royale. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg We’ve learned how to run a successful live service game, how important player sentiment is, and how it’s entirely possible to captivate users with storytelling in a multiplayer game. For us, Apex Legends is more than a game. It brings people together, it unifies players, it entertains, it takes our minds off of the real world, even if just for 30 minutes a day. It’s an avenue for artists, writers, streamers, and content creators to express themselves. It’s also a game that takes a stance on the importance of diversity. We’ve heard stories from players all over the world about how our game has kept friends and family members connected during the pandemic and how some of our innovations, such as the ping system, have made multiplayer gaming more accessible. We’ve even heard heartfelt stories from our fans about how Apex helped save their lives. It’s you, the players, that motivate us to create games, it always has been. Thank you for playing, Legends. Your support and love over the last two years have been an overwhelmingly positive driving force as we continue to make Apex all it can be. We hope you enjoy the launch of Season 8: Mayhem, and all the rest to come. – Chad ",

        "contents": "Happy birthday to Apex Legends, which is somehow only a day away from celebrating its second anniversary. To mark the occasion, Respawn has released a number of images showing the game in its early stages, which reveal a little more about how the game evolved from its Titanfall roots. After the launch of Titanfall 2, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-30-apex-legends-newest-map-was-a-titanfall-3-concept\">Respawn initially began work on Titanfall 3</a>, but this was parked after the developer began to experiment with a battle royale mode in the Titanfall universe - and this became Apex Legends. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/two-years-of-apex-legends\">new blog post</a> by game director Chad Grenier, the prototype was initially made by two designers, and was then developed into a game mode called \"Survival\" which allowed pilots and titans to battle it out to be last man standing. It seems the mode had a slightly smaller lobby size than current-day Apex, with a total of 24 pilots instead of 60, but the idea of teams of three dropping together was present even in these very early stages. Squads would arrive in style inside a drop pod, however, which teams would have to enter as a trio inside the drop ship. Soon, Apex's team size grew to over 20 people, and by October 2017 Respawn had the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith. The prototype map was apparently rather different from Kings Canyon, and was rather imaginatively called \"real big map\". It was sparse enough for \"titans to roam freely\", but both titans and wall running later had to be removed for the sake of game balance. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-03-apex-legends-first-map-was-sparse-enough-for-titans-to-roam-freely\">Read more</a> ",

Collection Events are a regular occurrence in Apex Legends, and involve opening special Collection Event Packs in order to unlock limited edition skins. In previous events, players were able to unlock specific skins using Apex Coins - either for legends or weapons - or pay slightly less Apex Coins for a random skin from the event. In this iteration, if you collect all 24 items, you will be rewarded with 150 heirloom shards - and therefore a free pick of the existing heirlooms. All cosmetics in the event will be Epic or Legendary quality, but fans are describing it as a cash grab by EA.

Switch players won't have to wait too long to get their hands on one of the best <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-battle-royale-game\">battle royale games</a> around, as it releases on March 9. Respawn also confirmed that it planned to release the mobile port during the 2021-22 financial year.

Furthermore, playing on Switch will give you double XP for two weeks after launch. The Switch port will also launch with cross-play enabled, meaning Switch players will be able to join lobbies with Xbox, PlayStation, and PC players.

        "contents": "The latest season of Apex Legends introduces our most explosive Legend yet, a hard-hitting new gun, a world-shattering update to Kings Canyon, and a whole new batch of quality-of-life updates. Season 8: Mayhem brings the boom starting February 2nd at 10am PT. Read on for details. DEVSTREAM Join the designers as they break down the most explosive updates coming in Season 8. MEET FUSE Meet Fuse: a mercenary-turned-cage fighter who never turns down a good dust-up. His affinity for explosions allows him to carry extra grenades and to throw them faster and further. He can launch a cluster bomb with airburst explosives. And when it’s time to really bring the boom, Fuse uses “Wally” to launch a bombardment that encircles an area in a ring of flames. Passive - Grenadier Stack an extra grenade per inventory slot. Fire grenades farther, faster, and more accurately. Tactical - Knuckle Cluster Launch a cluster bomb that continuously expels airburst explosives on impact. Ultimate - The Motherlode Launch a bombardment that encircles a target area in a wall of flames. NEW WEAPON: 30-30 REPEATER This heavy ammo lever-action repeater boasts hard-hitting rounds that’ll nail a fleeing Mirage at 200 paces. The 30-30 is the benchmark for reliability, designed to withstand whipping sandstorms and temporal instability, which made it an obvious choice for the Apex Games. DISCIPLINED TRIGGER FINGER The 30-30 Repeater requires the user to rechamber their rounds between shots which brings a methodic rhythm to the rifle, an analogue elegance that the modern weapons of the Outlands just can’t quite capture. To further tempt those itchy trigger fingers, the 30-30 Repeater has a built-in charge giving players an opportunity to deal increased damage with each shot at the cost of a short build-up. The 30-30 reloads one round at a time, which makes for some very interesting resource management you won’t find anywhere else, even on the Mastiff. The 30-30’s engagement range allows unique opportunities to reload individual rounds between shots. This gives the Repeater the ability to lay down consistent precision ranged pressure, something weapons with full reloads can sometimes struggle with. KINGS CANYON MAP UPDATE Season 8 once again sees changes to Kings Canyon. The main new point of interest shows the devastation from the ship crashing into the map. Players can now explore beyond Artillery, Spotted Lakes takes over the Slums and some new observation towers for basic recon or a sniper’s nest. Read more on the map changes in the map blog here. LEGENDARY MAGAZINES Season 8 introduces the Gold-tier magazines. Attaching it to a weapon automatically reloads your stowed weapons after a brief delay. The Gold magazine has the same capacity as Purple mags, and is available for Light, Heavy, Snipers, and Energy Weapons. QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES Damage counter We have now added a damage counter to the HUD. This was a highly requested feature, so we’re excited to allow people easier tracking for chasing those badges and challenges! Pinging Ammo Pinging weapons or ammo in your inventory displays your current ammo count along with \"player wants ammo\" in quick chat. Color Blind update Healing and reviving will now follow colorblind rules when colorblind settings are enabled Lore Blurbs on Canon Skins Some of our skins are canon, and some are just for fun. For the skins that represent an important part of that character's backstory, we've added a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the Legend's life. LEGEND META Wraith: Hitbox adjustments. Dev Note: We know Wraith will always be a popular pick considering the amount of combat utility in her kit. After many tweaks to her abilities and animations, the fact remains that her win rate continues to be at the very top as it has since day one. With Season 7 hitbox adjustments to Pathfinder, we were able to control his power without nerfing his kit. We hope to do the same with Wraith. Wraith now has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small legends, but the changes stay true to her model. As you can see in the before and after comparison, we’re adding some width mostly in the torso and leg areas. Even with these changes, Wraith remains small and hard to hit. She will retain Low Profile as we monitor her usage and win rates to see if power can be given back in other ways in the future. Rampart: Sheila angle increase from 120° to 180° Wall health in build phase increased from 1hp to 45hp (sniper rounds still pierce through) Dev Note: Rampart has remained at the bottom across our performance metrics since her release. Her kit is very much built around proactively setting up a powerful position, but in a game as fast-moving as Apex, we determined her walls should have some reactive power as well. We’re keeping a careful eye on this one. Horizon: Gravity Lift effective cooldown increased from 21s to 25s. The 15s cooldown timer will now start when the Gravity Lift disappears. Dev Note: Horizon released strong, to the point where she rivals Wraith in win rate and pick rate. For the time being, we are monitoring her usage and checking whether or not the cooldown changes have a significant effect. Octane: Launch Pad Remastered: Many players may have known about Octane’s “super-jump” that was possible with a well-timed jump while hitting the pad. Once the double-jump option was introduced, there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage. We decided to add some launch options that are better defined than the old super-jump. Hitting the jump pad from a standing position will launch players along a high arc (the speed and trajectory of the old super-jump). From a crouched position, players will launch along a low arc, meaning they’ll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction. Crypto: Remove ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones. Loba: Loot inside unopened care packages is now visible with Eye for Quality and accessible through the Black Market Boutique. Caustic: All gas now dissipates as soon as Caustic’s team is eliminated. Mirage: Mirage decoys create footstep sounds. Dev Note: This change was mistakenly mentioned in the Fight Night patch notes when it was in fact coming with this patch. Mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity. There won’t be a footstep tornado if an enemy Mirage ults nearby, but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real Mirage from audio cues alone. WEAPON META Fully Kitted Rotation Removed: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator Added: R-301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, Spitfire Attachments We are removing the Gold Barrel from the loot pool Hop Ups The Double Tap hop up will be removed from the loot pool The Anvil Rounds hop up will be added into the loot pool Volt Bullet damage decreased from 16 to 15 Alternator Bullet damage increased from 15 to 16 Spitfire Bullet damage increased from 18 to 19 Reload speed increased from 2.8 seconds to 3.2 Empty Reload speed increased from 3.33 seconds to 3.8 EVA 8 Fire rate increased from 2.0 to 2.1 BUG FIXES Caustic Sonar abilities no longer stop Caustic’s highlight vision. Loba Fixed a few exploitable areas on Kings Canyon that Loba was able to reach via her Bracelet. Rampart Jumpads in Octane’s town takeover no longer allow Rampart to place Sheila on them. Fixed an issue with Rampart's passive persisting even after changing characters in Firing Range Havoc Fixed an issue causing the Havoc to have 100% accuracy when hip-fired through Rampart’s Amped Cover. Peacekeeper Fixed a POV issue that occurred when using Horizon’s abilities, then immediately going into ADS with a Peacekeeper. Clubs Re-enabled ability to invite friends to club from friends list Fixed an issue causing some users who have opted out of \"Last Squad Invites\" to not appear in club event timelines when placing in the top 5 of a match Failing to connect to the club database no longer leads to a misleading \"Kicked from club\" message Players will no longer be kicked from clubs when switching to another profile on Xbox. MISC Fixed an issue with crowds not cheering in Pathfinder’s Town takeover. Fixed an issue preventing some heirlooms from appearing in the heirloom shop. Fixed an issue that allowed Thermites to deal damage through certain walls on Olympus. ",

The first-person shooter soon staked its claim as one of the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-battle-royale-game\">best battle royale games</a> by seamlessly blending gameplay and lore - and never once stopping to catch its breath. The game has changed a lot in two years. We've seen new maps come and go (and then <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-kings-canyon-changes\">return again irreparably scarred</a>), the roster of characters double (even with <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/apex-legends/season-4-release-date\">some being killed off</a> before they even make it to the games), and countless balancing attempts happen every season. Remember when Evo Shields were a rare sight and the Peacekeeper was ground loot? Remember Mirage Voyage? But how does a game with a ranked play system and some of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/biggest-esports-games\">biggest esports tournaments</a> balance constant changes, how does the development team decide what needs adding to the meta of a battle royale game - and when do you stop?

There will be different maps in rotation, an increased focus on skill-based matchmaking, and more players crowned Apex Predators than ever before. The developer revealed that between 30% and 40% of all <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> matches take place on the ranked ladder and that more people are ranking higher than ever before. In Ranked Season 7, 4.37% of players who played more than five hours of ranked achieved Diamond status, over twice as many as the previous season. More players also reached Platinum rank, and nearly twice as many hit Master and Apex Predator rank in Season 7 compared with Season 6 (0.2% compared with 0.12%). Looking forwards, in Season 8 Respawn is improving matchmaking, even at the expense of longer queue times.

However, his penchant for pyrotechnics carries over to his in-game abilities, which all lean towards the ordnance side of things.

We'll update that again once we've had a chance to play around with Fuse ourselves and see how he stacks up against the likes of Bloodhound and Horizon.

We now have confirmation that the gold magazine is \"capable of automatically reloading holstered weapons\". This sounds like a game-changing benefit if you can get your hands on one, but Respawn's lead game designer Daniel Klein has some words of reassurance for those who think it will be overpowered. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gold-magazine-leak\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/switch-mobile-release-date\">Apex Legends is coming to Switch next month, mobile release announced</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Apex Legends Season 8 dishes out nerfs to Wraith and Horizon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/evolution-interview\">Building a legend: Apex Legends developers on the evolution of a battle royale</a> ",

With crossplay now a standard feature, the growing number of PC players are able to jump into the fray together with their console-based friends. That is, with the exception of those patiently awaiting the game's Nintendo Switch release. However, a fresh round of leaks all point towards a February 2 launch - in-line with the advent of Season 8. Back at the end of December, Reddit user 'WaterGotHim' shared a <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/kmb4os/apex_on_nintendo_switch_release_date_from_ea/\">supposed message from a member of EA's marketing division</a> claiming that a February 1 release date was being targeted. Parts of the message, possibly pertaining to pricing or items bundled with the release, were blurred out. This at least indicates that there may be more details to be revealed, either officially or otherwise, in the lead up to the Switch launch. Additionally, in the past week, two new posts have surfaced on the ApexUncovered subreddit, seemingly confirming that a February 2 launch is on the cards from Amazon's <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/l4ip4h/nintendo_switch_on_japanese_amazon_switch/\">Japanese</a> and <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/kymdbp/nintendo_switch_version_can_be_found_on_the/\">Mexican</a> sites. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/switch-release-date-leak\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Apex Legends Season 8 dishes out nerfs to Wraith and Horizon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/evolution-interview\">Building a legend: Apex Legends developers on the evolution of a battle royale</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a> ",

Hailing from the fringe world of Salvo, the overconfident Aussie has made some enemies on his way to King's Canyon, not least 'Mad' Maggie, his ex-best friend who resents his entry to the games. However, upon his inauguration to the competition, Maggie decides to take her revenge. While the latest mustachioed member of the games takes in the plaudits from the crowds and loads his rocket launcher with fireworks, little does he know all hell will soon break loose. Hell that will have permanent effects on the landscape of King's Canyon. Maggie hacks into Fuse's ship, aiming the cannons at the innocent crowds below. However, it's her big finale which will have the biggest impact on King's Canyon. She sets off bombs planted in the iconic mountains at the centre of the map, reducing them to mere rubble. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-kings-canyon-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/evolution-interview\">Building a legend: Apex Legends developers on the evolution of a battle royale</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fuse-abilities\">Apex Legends Fuse: abilities, trailer, and everything we know so far</a> ",

A release date of 2nd February, the same day as the launch of the new season, was spotted in the Japanese version of a Stories from the Outlands trailer for Season 8. \"On February 2nd, it will be possible to play on Switch at the same time as the start of Season 8\", the description read (as spotted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TitanfallBlog/status/1351225101103071242?s=20\">Apex Legends News</a>). The same message was spotted in several other descriptions for the video, including the Polish and Danish versions, so it seems this wasn't an isolated slip-up. The text never featured in the English-language version of the trailer, while the reference to a Switch release has now been removed from the other language versions. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-19-looks-like-apex-legends-is-coming-to-switch-in-february\">Read more</a> ",

Fuse - described as a \"blow-up-first ask-questions-later kinda guy\" on the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/season-8\">Apex Legends website</a> - will be the 16th hero to join the game since its launch almost two years ago now, and his official unveiling arrives in the form of a new Stories from the Outlands video. It's a whistle-stop animated tour of Fuse's chaotic life - from childhood to present - detailing his adventures with an unnamed partner-in-crime on the planet Salvo, his eventual crowning as Bonecage Champion, and the events that led to the Aussie demolitions expert losing his arm. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-18-apex-legends-new-hero-is-blow-up-first-ask-questions-later-kinda-guy-fuse\">Read more</a> ",

Season 8 sees the addition of Fuse as the battle royale's sixteenth legend, and his enthusiasm for explosives is sure to cause a stir. From his Stories from the Outlands lore video, we see that Fuse is a hardened brute who competed as a brawling gladiator on the planet Salvo. Appearing alongside a companion in the video - who Respawn lead writer Amanda Doiron <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmandaDoiron11/status/1351213573125582870\">confirms is called Mad Maggie</a> - Fuse declares that he is leaving Salvo to become the first from his planet to join the Apex Games. On hearing this news, a brawl ensues between Fuse and Mags, and the golden grenade that the pair have carried around since childhood is detonated. In the blast, Fuse loses an arm, but survives and walks away saying: \"it's a lost cause.\" The trailer is purely cinematic, so we haven't got a glimpse at any abilities just yet. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-fuse\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fuse-abilities\">Apex Legends gameplay trailer shows off new legend Fuse's abilities</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gold-magazine-leak\">Apex Legends Season 8 will introduce gold magazines that automatically reload</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/switch-release-date-leak\">Fresh Apex Legends leaks indicate February 2 Nintendo Switch release date</a> ",

She combined Revenant's Ultimate ability with Wraith's portal and the popular flyhacking glitch with Olympus' Trident vehicles for one of the most complicated plays we've seen in a long time. The play didn't end well, with the whole team getting downed by the players at the other end of the portal, but she still posted the clip - and it makes for great watching.

We see Pathfinder's unfortunate upbringing on the planet Malta. After being fired from multiple jobs because of his clumsiness and general errors, he was looking for his calling in life. That's when he happened across ex-cop Lieutenant Maldera, who is now a prison guard. After yet another mishap while serving in the prison canteen and the robot is falsely accused of murder, the unlikely duo are forced into each others' lives. As Maldera interrogates Pathfinder, he delves into the robot's data banks, but finds out more than he bargained for.

Like a child with a sled waking up to a snow-covered street, the excitement of sliding around King's Canyon, World's Edge, and Olympus is comparable only to getting a team wipe with a Mozambique. Okay, maybe we're overhyping it, but sliding is great - and it's mechanically important, too, decreasing the size of your hitbox and giving you a small speed boost. However, as is so often the case with competitive games - players have found a way to abuse the mechanic. Reddit user u/KremitOG found that rebinding their keys <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/khtrbz/crouch_bound_to_scroll_wheel_allows_for_infinite/\">allowed their character to slide forever</a> without losing momentum. The exploit is based on the fact that if you are sprinting forwards and tap to toggle crouch on and off quickly, you'll be able to get some small speed boosts. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/infinite-slide-glitch\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bug-bouncing-loot\">Apex Legends bug makes gravity-defying loot</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/caustic-buff-reversed\">Apex Legends' planned Caustic buff reversed</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pathfinder-lore\">Apex Legends lore video dives into Pathfinder's troubled past</a> ",

The third seasonal circuit of the Apex Legends Global Series is coming to a head this weekend with the Autumn Circuit Playoffs. The $500,000 prize pool will be divvied out between teams based on their performances in this tournament and this tournament alone, as they face off against the best opponents from their region. As exciting as this sounds - and it will undoubtedly be exciting - Apex Legends has had a pretty defensive meta since the esport's inception. Aside from portalling DPS character Wraith, the most popular legends in competitive Apex are Wattson, who can garrison a position with electrified fences, and Gibraltar, whose fortified buff makes him harder to take down and whose Dome Shield can protect teammates from immediate danger. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-lynx-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-lore-teaser\">Apex Legends: third lore teaser for Horizon appears in Olympus</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 7: ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-fuse\">Apex Legends Season 8: Mayhem introduces new legend Fuse</a> ",

Limited-time mode: Winter Express Hi everyone, I’m Mark Yampolsky, Systems Designer on Apex Legends, and I’m here to tell you about a fan-favorite mode we’re bringing back this Holo-Day Season, now with some exciting changes! The train is back in World’s Edge just for Winter Express, and this time it’s not the only vehicle descending into the valley around Epicenter. The supply ships from Kings Canyon are also flying around the frozen explosion. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/6a967f7444b5fbc386ac8abca9f9ee96395adf96.png For those of you who haven’t played it before, Winter Express is a round-based mode where three squads battle for control of the train as it makes its way around World’s Edge. This year, when your squad respawns after a round has finished, you will spawn on your own supply ship as it follows the train. From here, your squad will be able to survey the battlefield and skydive into combat as the train arrives at its next station and the objective unlocks. The squad that won the previous round will respawn directly on the train. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/38753f3b74b57fea821130728138fe35c934691d.png We’ve also added a new station for the train to stop at: Derailment is the scene of a catastrophic accident that occurred as a cargo train travelling the opposite direction took a tricky turn at high speed. This new station has a variety of flanking opportunities, and a unique rotation under the bridge where the train stops. This allows you to quickly change which side of the objective you’re attacking. These changes should significantly reduce some of the long respawn times between rounds that players experienced last year. We can now spawn you earlier on the supply ships, and the longest section of track between stations is now divided in half with Derailment. We think these changes will make the mode an even more awesome experience. Some new Legends have joined the games since Winter Express was last live, including: Loba, Revenant, Rampart, and Horizon. These Legends shake up the mode in new, exciting ways and we can’t wait for you to find new strategies for defending the objective or breaking through a powerful enemy line. We’ve also refreshed and rebalanced loadouts for this mode to include new weapons and purple armor for more exciting engagements that really help show off what our Legends can do. Holo-Day Rewards Track This year, Holo-Day Bash contains a rewards track with all-new unlockables. The rewards track will be available the same time as Winter Express, December 1 to January 4.

A month of sales Brand new wintery cosmetics Return of a fan favorite mode from December 1 to January 4 An all-new rewards track A Month of Sales Starting today with Black Friday, check back every week from November 24 to January 4 for a new set of sales including all-new Loba, Revenant, and Spitfire Legendary Skins. Limited-time mode: Winter Express Hi everyone, I’m Mark Yampolsky, Systems Designer on Apex Legends, and I’m here to tell you about a fan-favorite mode we’re bringing back this Holo-Day Season, now with some exciting changes! The train is back in World’s Edge just for Winter Express, and this time it’s not the only vehicle descending into the valley around Epicenter. The supply ships from Kings Canyon are also flying around the frozen explosion. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/6a967f7444b5fbc386ac8abca9f9ee96395adf96.png For those of you who haven’t played it before, Winter Express is a round-based mode where three squads battle for control of the train as it makes its way around World’s Edge. This year, when your squad respawns after a round has finished, you will spawn on your own supply ship as it follows the train. From here, your squad will be able to survey the battlefield and skydive into combat as the train arrives at its next station and the objective unlocks. The squad that won the previous round will respawn directly on the train. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/38753f3b74b57fea821130728138fe35c934691d.png We’ve also added a new station for the train to stop at: Derailment is the scene of a catastrophic accident that occurred as a cargo train travelling the opposite direction took a tricky turn at high speed. This new station has a variety of flanking opportunities, and a unique rotation under the bridge where the train stops. This allows you to quickly change which side of the objective you’re attacking. These changes should significantly reduce some of the long respawn times between rounds that players experienced last year. We can now spawn you earlier on the supply ships, and the longest section of track between stations is now divided in half with Derailment. We think these changes will make the mode an even more awesome experience. Some new Legends have joined the games since Winter Express was last live, including: Loba, Revenant, Rampart, and Horizon. These Legends shake up the mode in new, exciting ways and we can’t wait for you to find new strategies for defending the objective or breaking through a powerful enemy line. We’ve also refreshed and rebalanced loadouts for this mode to include new weapons and purple armor for more exciting engagements that really help show off what our Legends can do.

Any pride I could’ve had in a heroine whose skin resembled mine was taken from me. I could find comfort in neither my skin colour nor my ethnicity as a brown Latina, for there were no Latina characters I knew of.

Many felt that the reworked pass, which requires you to earn '<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-stars\">Battle Stars</a>' in order to rise through the tiers, was overly grindy. When Season 7 first landed, it wasn't uncommon to see players reporting that it was taking 2-4 hours of gameplay to move up a single tier. Thankfully, developer Respawn Entertainment was quick to address the issue, promptly rolling out a first batch of tweaks and promising that more changes would arrive soon enough. Well, Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier has now detailed precisely what those changes are, and it sounds like many of the pass' issues will shortly be behind it. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-additional-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 7: Ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/quads-explainer\">Apex Legends won't have quads because three is \"the magic number\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 7 tier list</a> ",

To answer community concerns, several members of the Apex Legends dev team recently held a Reddit Q&A in which they addressed the unpopular battle pass. But the team also touched on another topic: the worrying problem of crunch in the games industry. The comment on crunch comes from Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier, who was responding to a player who wanted more LTMs and felt Respawn was being \"slow with content\". Grenier assured the commenter the team was not scared of LTMs, but explained they normally drop-off in interest after a few days, making a two-week format unsuitable. He then went on to state that Respawn was trying to avoid crunch - and content would perhaps release a little slower as a result. \"We also refuse to crunch the team, so we'll probably be slower at making content than if we worked 15 hour days but that's just not something we're willing to do,\" <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/jpb4w3/were_the_team_who_brought_you_horizon_olympus_and/gbec1sj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">Grenier said</a>. \"We have nearly doubled our team size since launch to accommodate the content demands, so we're really trying to bring you quality content at a healthy pace.\" <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-11-10-we-refuse-to-crunch-the-team-says-apex-legends-director\">Read more</a> ",

Just hours into the new season though, it became clear that the new star system was making Battle Pass progression much harder than in previous seasons. That's because there are only two methods of earning stars: completing daily and weekly challenges, or accrue 10,000 XP to earn one star. After hearing the criticism, Respawn has now taken action. While the distribution of stars for challenges will stay the same, weekly challenges will now take \"less time\" to complete. It has also slashed the amount of XP you need to hit to earn extra stars. Players will only need to gain 5,000 XP to earn a star now. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-additional-changes\">Apex Legends Season 7 Battle Pass gets another round of tweaks</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/quads-explainer\">Apex Legends won't have quads because three is \"the magic number\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 7 tier list</a> ",

Horizon was right, but it cost her everything. Now Horizon is entering the Games to earn enough money to find a way to travel back in time and be with her son. Fortunately she’s developed some powerful gravity-altering tech to help her along the way. Horizon’s custom spacesuit allows her to fall from great heights and control her movements in the air. She can deploy gravity lifts to give her team a vertical boost, and she can even deploy N.E.W.T. to drop a micro black hole to suck opponents in and blast them with gravity.

A new gravity-defying legend joins the now 15 strong roster, and the Kings Canyon map has been vaulted for the duration of the season in favour of the new one - Olympus. It's not just a new map and legend though. The new Trident hovercar gives entire teams new mobility options, players will be able to set up or join existing clubs of like-minded players, and the game will be launching on Steam for the first time. We're also seeing some quality of life updates for the Replicator, air drops, and automatic attachment swapping. Some of the legends have had some balancing, but the bigger changes seem to be more on updating the weapons, how much damage the Ring does, and increased the requirements to evolve Evo Armor so that fewer players have it maxed out by the end game. Rounding things off are some bug fixes, including one that ensures that footstep audio plays more reliably. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-patch-notes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-additional-changes\">Apex Legends Season 7 Battle Pass gets another round of tweaks</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/quads-explainer\">Apex Legends won't have quads because three is \"the magic number\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 7 tier list</a> ",

Join the designers as they discuss all the new stuff coming in Season 7 and breakdown some of the bigger changes coming to Legends and weapons. Season 7 New Legend: Horizon {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/558b135b895a0f329f6e6ed9fc38f4e4d14e821d.png Meet Horizon! She’s the newest Legend, a brilliant scientist, and a master of gravity manipulation. She has a deep connection to the new arena, and a motivation that will tug at your heartstrings. Horizon’s custom space suit allows her to fall from great heights and control her movements in the air. Using her custom technology, she can use gravity lifts to give her team a vertical boost, and she can even deploy NEWT (her small robot named after her son, Newton) to drop a micro black hole that pulls opponents into the center for some serious crowd control. Passive: Spacewalk Increase air control and reduce fall impacts with Horizon’s custom spacesuit. Tactical: Gravity Lift Reverse the flow of gravity, lifting players upward and boosting them outward when they exit. Ultimate: Black hole Deploy NEWT to create a micro black hole that sucks in nearby Legends. New Map: Olympus {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/e576f4d842aabae92e376522336ec195ae941b6a.png The Legends have entered a new arena: the sky city of Olympus. A utopia floating in clouds above Psamathe, it was once a place where the brightest minds in the Outlands could gather and exchange ideas. However, an accident in an experimental research facility led to the creation of the Phase Rift (a massive bubble of Phase energy), and the city was abandoned. Now players can use Olympus’ luxurious amenities to their advantage. Rotating agricultural towers, beautiful gardens and classy restaurants serve as new stages for intense skirmishes. New vehicles called Tridents give your squad a way to boost into battle and take your enemies by surprise. The Phase Runner – a tunnel of Phase energy running through the center of Olympus – lets you cross the map in seconds. And the Rift stands tall over everything, mysterious and beckoning . . . New Vehicle: The Trident {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/3885f31a86691fea55ef6e73b09ba48c46ee14c5.png Exclusive to Olympus, the Trident is a hover car designed for your whole squad. Cruise the highways to avoid chokepoints or use the boost to soar over jumps, this thing is made to speed up those early game rotations. Drive in third person, or ride as a passenger in first person with full shooting capabilities. The Trident is durable, so it will never explode, but damage applied from enemy fire will be dispersed amongst the players in the car. Don’t worry, you can still do full damage to players by hitting them directly so we expect to see some amazing Kraber shots. Disembark to park it anywhere and use it as makeshift cover in the late game. The Trident interacts with Legend abilities in many different ways, experiment and have fun! LTM: Olympus Preview To help you understand and explore the map without fear of getting shot, we are introducing a new playlist called Olympus Preview. This mode teams you up with 30 Legends on Olympus and allows you to roam the map to learn map drops, loot areas, and practice your routes to the end game. Circles are still on and once circle 4 finishes, players are brought back up to the plane to start the second skydive run. There are a total of 3 runs before the match ends. This mode is only available for one week. Clubs {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/f4adb0ce9fba962fae50854f5e9af2d22681a5de.png With this season, we are introducing clubs. Join a club with like minded legends and make it easier to find your champion squad. Don’t see a particular club you like, then create one and let your friends know to join! Read more on cubs here. Steam {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/ae146e34b9b578c5a78e99fdfe4b4ea1d900a5df.jpg Boot up Steam and start downloading and play Apex Legends! If you’re coming from Origin, all your progress and unlocks will carry over. And for a limited time, log into Steam and receive these Half-Life and Portal inspired weapon charms. Battle Pass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/49e20f3beae02bb77deecd04ba2ee32a5954f25a.png The Season 7 Battle Pass is all about that high fashion. Level up your Pass to unlock the skins like the Wraith “High Class” and Octane’s “Fast Fashion”. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/74bf25da6ef7bcbf820aad4c199551d3aff6a1e4.png Challenges are no longer points-based and are now granted between 1 to 5 stars, depending on their difficulty. Collecting 10 stars will take you to the next Battle Pass level. We have also added tabs to the challenges menu in the lobby that allow you to toggle between daily, top weekly, and event challenges. Within a match, players can open the map and see this same widget in game. For more on the changes to Challenges, check out this dev blog. Quality of Life Updates Attachment Swap Improvements When replacing an attachment with one from the ground, if the old attachment is an improvement for your other weapon, the old attachment will get automatically transferred. Replicator Updates For Season 7, we have removed weapons from the crafting pool and have replaced them with Shield batteries. The high level attachments will still be tailored towards a weapon category. We now prevent other players from picking up items that you crafted for the first 5 seconds after crafting. This can be disabled by pinging the item. Air Drop Clarity The colors of the beams have been changed to differentiate between normal airdrops, Lifeline's airdrops, and Replicator airdrops. Normal drops are a light tan, Lifeline's drops are blue, and Replicator drops and teal. All of the airdrops' landing area FX while it's coming down matches their colors. Airdrop beams still stay visible when close to the airdrop, instead of fading when you get close. The beam still disappears when the pod is opened. Misc The Arc Star now shows an Arc Star model when one is thrown near you, instead of a grenade. Added a new VO line when you are using a Phoenix Kit Added a new VO line when you drop a Holo Spray You can now ping ammo in your inventory to request more from your squad Made modifications to The Ring to reduce the amount of unplayable space in the circles. Map Rotations Regular Map Rotation For 2 weeks, Olympus will be the only map you can play on. After that week we go into a normal rotation between Olympus and World’s Edge. We will be vaulting Kings Canyon for the time being. Season 7 Ranked Rotation The first half of Ranked Split will be played on Olympus. The second half of ranked will be played on World’s Edge. For more information on this season’s ranked updates, check out the ranked blog here. Legend Meta Bangalore Rolling Thunder: Reduced the time it takes for explosion from 8 seconds to 6 seconds. Dev Note: Not much to say here. Rolling Thunder will continue to function primarily as a zoning ability, but with a somewhat shorter fuse, it will encourage enemies to leave the zone slightly faster. Caustic Nox Gas Trap/Nox Gas Grenade: Legends no longer get a blurred vision effect while in the gas. Damage updated from 4-10 ticks of damage to 6-12 ticks of damage. Dev Note: Fighting in Caustic Gas is one of the most frustrating things in Apex Legends, and yet we need the gas to represent a meaningful threat or else enemies will just ignore it. With this change we’re attacking what we think is the greatest contributor to this frustration: the fact that your vision is blurred while you’re in gas. This made it extremely hard to fight back. To make up for lost power, we’re upping the damage from the gas a bit. Mirage Psyche Out/Life of the Party: Decoys now have 45 health Dev Note: Our bamboozler-in-chief is a hard Legend to keep relevant. Every time we make a change to decoys, there is a clear uptick in usage and power as Mirage mains learn to use their new tools, and then as the rest of the world catches on and starts being able to tell the real Mirage from his equally handsome holographs, that uptick disappears. This time around we want to try and make it a little bit harder to clear out decoys. We’re giving them health, but to make this very clear up front: they will not work as a shield. While they take damage from bullets, the bullet also passes through them and hits whatever’s behind them. This is what we call the hallway test: you should not be able to win an engagement against an enemy in a straight coverless hallway by snapcasting a decoy and having said decoy eat an entire Wingman shot. Decoys will also play unique hit effects and briefly flicker out of existence when taking damage to help you differentiate between them and the real Mirage. Octane Swift Mend: Doubled healing rate (from 0.5 hp/s to 1.0 hp/s) Dev note: Octane is a Legend for players who like to go fast, run face first into the enemy, and get knocked down a lot. We think that’s absolutely fine; the fact that his Trios winrate isn’t great doesn’t really bother us because both his encounter win rate (think of this as his ability to score knockdowns) and his pick rate are very healthy. That said, we figured we could give him a little extra out of combat help. His passive’s heal rate was very slow, requiring up to 200s to fully heal your health bar. Wattson Perimeter Security: Increased damage per touch from 10 to 15. Dev Note: Wattson is the anti-Octane: not super powerful individually, not picked very often at all below Plat, but an absolute must have for competitive squads. We’re also happy with that niche, but figured it would be safe to give her a little extra power in her best case: people running into her fences. We’re aiming for this to bring up her power and attractiveness at lower levels of play especially, since we don’t see a lot of players run into Wattson fences in high skill matches. Loba Black Market: Ammo taken no longer counts towards Black Market’s maximum. You can scoop up all the ammo in range. Dev Note: We’re taking another swing at making Loba the ultimate Legend to bring to solve all of your team’s loot needs. We have heard your feedback that you want improvements to her tactical as well, and while that’s certainly not off the table, our data suggest that her encounter win rate (how many knockdowns she gets compared to how many times she’s knocked down, across all matches) is quite healthy. It’s her Trios winrate that’s worryingly low. Make no mistake: this is a major swing at making Black Market powerful. Rampart Sheila: Now takes 1.25 seconds to fully spin up, down from 2 seconds. Amped Wall: Now takes 3 seconds to fully build, down from 4 seconds. Dev Note: In patch 6.1, we made a small change to how long it takes Sheila to tighten her bullet spread. This didn’t meaningfully increase her winrate. The other half of that change is in this patch. We do not want to change Rampart away from being a Legend that requires setup, but we do want to make it faster to set up. Amped Wall should remain a mostly out of combat setup ability rather than a reactive ability and Sheila should remain an area denial tool rather than a murder machine, but like all things, these balance points exist on a spectrum, and with this patch we’re moving them slightly closer to reactive/murder machine territory. Pathfinder Dev Note: Pathfinder continues to be an overachiever in terms of win rate. The good news is that his grapple change in 6.1 didn’t move his win rate by much (it went up 1% in total). We’re doing two things this patch: we’re adjusting his hitboxes and we’re putting in tuning for Grappling Hook that will firmly move it into buff territory. More context below! Hitbox: Pathfinder has a tall but extremely skinny hitbox. A lot of his model isn’t actually shootable and particularly his arms and legs do not represent a lot of shootable area either. Here is a before and after comparison of Pathfinder’s hitboxes: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/a69f8f2e6a84cf052b2a4132accfa445683df5c6.png As you can see, there is still a lot of negative space around his arms and legs. We’re hoping that by making it a little easier to hit Pathfinder, we can bring his win rate under control to the point where we can put meaningful power into his kit. Because the question is sure to come up: we are not yet removing Low Profile from Pathfinder with this change. Even with these increased hitboxes, Pathfinder will still be considerably harder to hit than most other characters in the game. If this change does make a meaningful difference in terms of his win rate we will drop Low Profile; but we really didn’t want to take it off him this patch only to have to put it back next patch when it turns out his winrate spiked. Grappling Hook: We’re making a number of changes to Grappling Hook. In 6.1 we shipped a very conservative version of this change; now that we know this didn’t meaningfully affect his winrate or, anecdotally, how frustrating it is to fight him, we’re shipping the much more aggressive version of the changelist. We also want to make it clear that players should not be punished for chaining grappling hook perfectly into other movement mechanics. Pathfinder no longer needs to be on the ground for Grappling Hook to be considered finished. The speed to which Pathfinder needs to drop for us to consider Grappling Hook finished was increased from 300 units/second to 500 units/second The maximum cooldown grapple can be set to was lowered to 30 seconds, from 35 seconds; the maximum amount of travel time before a new cooldown is set is now 5 seconds, rather than being uncapped. This means that effectively, you can never incur more than a 35 second cooldown. The amount of distance you can travel before you hit maximum cooldown was roughly doubled. Weapon Meta Supply Drop R99 Out of Supply Drop: The R99 will be returning to the normal loot pool this season, with the same stats it had before it went into the supply drop at the start of season 6. Damage: 12 -> 11 (from Care Package version to normal pre-season 6) Ammo 20/22/24/27 Prowler Into Supply Drop: The prowler is replacing the R99 in the supply drop. Despite the Selectfire hop-up being removed from the loot pool this season, the Prowler will still have the ability to change between 5 round bursts and full-auto. Magazine size: 35; reserve ammo: 175 Fully Kitted Weapons Removed: Devotion, Mastiff, Triple Take, Flatline, Volt New: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator Hemlok Increasing horizontal recoil of the first 3 shots slightly to the right (first burst when in burst mode) Increasing recoil magnitude in the later stages of the pattern Reducing recoil multiplier in single fire mode to help compensate for additional recoil in pattern. Recoil should mostly be increased in burst mode rather than single fire mode Reducing headshot multiplier 2.0 -> 1.75 (44 -> 39 damage headshot against no helmet base character) Dev Notes: While we are happy to see the Hemlok get more attention with the recent buffs, we think it is a little too strong in season 6. The effective range of the burst mode felt a bit too far, and the spike damage capabilities of a full headshot burst were too strong in high level play. Havoc Updated recoil pattern. Kicks up, then right, then left, then up again. Dev Notes: With 6.0, the Havoc got a new recoil pattern. This new recoil pattern was a bit too erratic and difficult to control, due to multiple rapid changes in direction. We have adjusted the recoil pattern to have the same general movement while simplifying the motions required to control the pattern. LSTAR LSTAR has a new recoil pattern that kicks horizontally at first and then settles into a relatively consistent upward recoil. Players who feather the trigger will be able to keep the LSTAR in the good portion of the recoil pattern. LSTAR venting time after letting go of the trigger has been reduced 0.4s -> 0.15s. LSTAR will now reduce heat faster when not overheated -- 1.15s from 99.9% to 0% charge if not overheated, still 2.45s if overheated. Dev Notes: The LSTAR had some limitations that caused it to feel worse than we’d like. The recoil pattern snaked back and forth, which was difficult to control reliably. Additionally, firing for short bursts and then releasing the trigger repeatedly, or “feathering the trigger”, felt somewhat clunky due to the long venting time after firing and the slow heat reduction. So, we are reducing those pain points to improve the viability and feel of feathering the trigger, and adjusting the recoil pattern to reward players who can effectively control the LSTAR’s heat. Sentinel Energized Sentinel now has a pure damage increase, instead of bonus damage only vs shields Energized Sentinel base damage 70 -> 88 Dev Notes: The Sentinel was still a bit weak. We think a good place to improve it is the energize ability. It seems a bit too situational, only being a benefit if the opponent has >70 shields. So, we are changing the energize from a “disruptor” anti-shield effect to an “amp” damage boost effect. Triple Take Fire rate 1.3 -> 1.2 Dev Note: The Triple Take is still performing a bit too well after the most recent nerf, so we are reducing the fire rate back to what it was before the 6.0 patch. We will be watching in the future to see how just the integrated choke, sniper ammo increase, and new popularity affect the weapon’s performance. Hop-Ups Quickdraw Holster Hop-up: This new hop-up attaches to the RE-45 and Wingman. When equipped, the gun becomes quicker to raise and lower, takes less time to ADS, and has reduced hipfire spread (particularly when not actively moving). This should open up new opportunities to use the two weapons, especially in close-quarters combat. The Selectfire Receiver hop-up will be removed from the loot pool to make room. Game Meta Changes Evo Armor requirements increased We increased the requirements to evolve Evo Armor in order to reduce the amount of players with Red Evo Armor during the end game. Level 0 -> 1 : 100 damage (from 50) Level 1 -> 2 : 150 damage (from 125) Level 2 -> 3 : 300 damage (from 250) Level 3 -> 4 : 750 damage (from 500) Ring damage reduced Ring 1: 2% per tick (same) Ring 2: 3% per tick (from 5%) Particularly this change should allow players enough time to pop a syringe if they are picked up in Ring 2. Ring 3: 5% per tick (from 10%) Ring 4: 10% per tick (from 20%) Ring 5: 10% per tick (from 20%) Ring 6: 15% per tick (from 25%) Ring 7: 15% per tick (from 25%) Bug Fixes Audio We’ve made some advancements in footstep audio playing more reliably. We have more work being done that we’ll continue to roll out as it gets completed. Pathfinder Fixed an issue with ziplines going through platforms when deployed from underneath. Wraith Fixed an issue with priming a grenade cancelling Wraith's ultimate. Octane Fixed an issue with getting stuck in double jump after using a jump pad. Fixed an issue with Octane being able to use healing items while on a zipline. Crypto Fixed an issue with his drone being able to drop items from Crypto’s inventory. Fixed an issue with his drone not being able to fit through certain windows. Fixed an issue with his drone marking friendly Mirage decoys as enemies. Revenant Fixed an issue with Revenant getting pushed into geo when his totem was deployed in tight spaces. Rampart Fixed an issue with Rampart not being able to place an amp wall while jumping. Fixed an issue with Sheila teleporting when placed on a hatch in World’s Edge Staging. ",

A solo queue experience in ranked is not the nicest experience, especially if you play at the top end of the Apex Legends ranks. So, in order to counter the toxic behaviour many complain about online, Respawn is adding a new social feature called Clubs feature for Season 7. Here players will be able to search for, or create, their own club once they hit level 10. These clubs currently only accommodate 30 members and will include a number of tags such as #RankedOnly or #MicRequired to bring like minded Apex Legends players together with the same goal in mind. The feature has been in the works since Season 4, according to designer Chad Armstrong, and was born out of Titanfall 2's Clans feature and the fact that many solo queue players often found themselves playing games with toxic randoms online. Statistics from trios games also suggested, unsurprisingly, that the majority of wins were being taken by \"full or partial squads,\" giving the design team a clear motivation for bringing this social feature to the battle royale. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/clubs\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-additional-changes\">Apex Legends Season 7 Battle Pass gets another round of tweaks</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/quads-explainer\">Apex Legends won't have quads because three is \"the magic number\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 7 tier list</a> ",

Over on its <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/season-7?isLocalized=true\">newly launched Season 7 page</a>, Respawn describes Horizon as a \"brilliant astrophysicist who escaped a black hole and aims to use her newfound mastery of gravity to keep a promise\". There's rather more to her backstory than that, however, and the character is more thoroughly introduced in an accompanying <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-amupfoQBE\">four-minute animated lore trailer</a>, full of space travel and betrayal, that ends up being a little more moving than you might expect. Turning to more practical concerns, there's no word yet on how Horizon will function from a gameplay perspective - other than those vague allusions to her \"mastery of gravity\", of course - but expect Respawn to flesh out those details, as well as sharing more on Season 7's new Trident vehicle and Olympus map (a \"beautiful, lush city in the clouds\"), closer to launch. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-27-apex-legends-new-hero-is-horizon-a-scottish-astrophysicist-with-a-mastery-of-gravity\">Read more</a> ",

Well, the biggest is that the game's OG map, Kings Canyon, will be booted out of competitive mode this season in favour of the brand new map Olympus. Season 6 saw both Kings Canyon and World's Edge used in competitive play, with the season split in half to allow a fair share of time on both maps. That same system will again carry over into the next ranked season, but Kings Canyon is going to be dropped to make way for the \"beautiful, lush city in the clouds\" that is Olympus. Don't worry though, it will return in a later season. Interestingly, Ranked Season 7 will see Olympus as the first map in rotation, meaning players will have to get to grips with new locations and strategies fast.

Season 7 in Apex Legends will be titled Ascension and will see the battle royale's third map, Olympus, drop. Described as a \"beautiful, lush city in the clouds,\" Olympus sounds like it'll have a bit of a different vibe to the harshness of Kings Canyon and World's Edge. We'll just have to wait for a first look at the map to confirm these suspicions, though. There will also be a fresh way to traverse Olympus with Apex Legends' first crack at driveable vehicles. While the image doesn't give much away, it appears that a small ship called The Trident will allow you and your squadmates to hop in and cover ground quickly. And, of course, with every new season comes a new legend. And this one is a right bonnie lass who has been teased by Respawn for a wee while now. Scottish astrophysicist Dr Mary Somers, who has the much catchier in-game name of Horizon, will become the game's 15th legend in Season 7, and her skill set includes a \"mastery of gravity.\" We're still awaiting the specifics on her abilities, but expect some floating. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-ascension\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-changes\">Respawn makes it easier to complete Apex Legends' Season 7 Battle Pass</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 7 tier list</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-stars\">Apex Legends players unhappy with Season 7 Battle Pass changes</a> ",

Reddit user 'KongoBoom' posted to the Apex Legends subreddit on October 21 decrying Respawn for banning him after being matched with a cheater who was terrorising prominent streamers. The original post has now been removed (you'll see why soon) but it was titled: \"Killing streamers got me banned\" - and it gained a lot of traction. The story goes that NRG's popular streamer 'LuLuLovely' was killed by a blatantly cheating Gibraltar player. As a result, she reported the incident to a member of the Apex Legends security team, along with video evidence. While the Gibraltar was quite clearly in the wrong and was of course banned, his Bloodhound teammate, KongoBoom, was also shown in the video and subsequently banned as well. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bloodhound-ban-nrg-lulu\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 7: Ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-patch-notes\">Apex Legends Season 7 patch notes - Horizon, Olympus, Trident, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/clubs\">Apex Legends Clubs will bring 30 players together in Season 7</a> ",

So when the recent <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-07-apex-legends-removed-wraiths-naruto-run-because-it-was-too-powerful\">Aftermarket update patch notes</a> mentioned a change to how the cooldown worked, many Pathfinder players thought their luck was in - until they saw the reality in practice. The recent change altered Pathfinder's grapple cooldown so it would be measured based on distance travelled, with a longer grapple resulting in a longer cooldown. With the game measuring the grapple \"from the moment you leave the ground to when you're on the ground again and not sliding at crazy high speeds\", this means you're now less likely to be punished for accidentally shooting your grapple too early (which happens to us all). But should you want to use your grapple to slingshot and slide out of trouble, the seconds can really stack up. Just take a look at the evidence below, in which a player effectively racks up a 42 second cooldown just for sliding on his bum after a grapple. This is because the cooldown timer only begins when Pathfinder has reached \"sprint speed\", and anything above that speed will not trigger the cooldown. For many players, this feels a little different to the 35 second \"maximum cooldown\" for long distances they were expecting from the recent patch notes, even if that's technically still true. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-09-pathfinders-grapple-change-wasnt-a-buff-after-all-says-apex-legends-dev\">Read more</a> ",

Shiring was preparing to release Apex Legends in the morning of February 4. His role would mean he oversaw operations and online services for the game - which, obviously, is crucial for the basic functions of a battle royale. However, Shiring was due to attend a hearing regarding the adoption of his daughter around the same time. Unfortunately the court was unaware of the release date of Apex Legends - after all, it was a secret game at this point.

While a bunch of cosmetics and LTM events are being thrown in with the Aftermarket update, cross-play is by far the standout feature. The cross-play beta is Respawn's first attempt at matchmaking console and PC players together, as previously players were limited to facing opponents on the same platform. According to a blog post from Respawn, there are a few caveats to matchmaking. Players on PS4 and Xbox One will only be matched up with other console players, and will only find themselves facing PC players if they are in a squad with a friend who is a PC user. This separation has been made to limit the number of encounters between controller players and mouse and keyboard players.

Don't forget the Apex Games are named after his band of mercenaries, the Apex Predators and every time you reach the highest level of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a>, you're classed as an honourary member. We expect both of these characters' arrivals to cause some friction in future seasons, especially between ex-IMC trooper Bangalore and anti-IMC war doctor Lifeline. Plus, something big is going to have to go down to bring the commissioner into the fray. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/kuben-blisk-leak\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/sentinel-glitch-rapid-fire\">A new Apex Legends glitch turns the Sentinel sniper rifle fully automatic</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/release-date\">The adorable story of Apex Legends' odd lunchtime release</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/aftermarket-pathfinders-grapple\">Apex Legends Aftermarket update finally buffs Pathfinder's grapple</a> ",

Everyone's favourite robot (sorry Revenant) was hit with a massive nerf at the start of Season 5, increasing the cooldown on his tactical ability from 15 seconds to 35. At the time, Respawn said the huge increase was to ensure Pathfinder couldn't use his Grapple twice in one firefight, but fans thought the change was extreme and his usage dropped off in tournaments, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a>, and even casual games. Season 6 also sees Pathfinder's fellow Recon Legends Bloodhound and Crypto given the ability to use Recon Beacons, which in previous seasons was a trait unique to Pathfinder. The beacons give valuable intel on the next ring location, and Crypto's drone can scan them instantaneously, making him a better choice than Pathfinder. Bloodhound was also on the receiving end of a handful of buffs, making them a strong choice of Recon Legend. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pathfinder-buff-confirmed-by-producer\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/cross-play-beta\">Apex Legends cross-play beta goes live with Aftermarket update</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/aftermarket-event-crossplay-release-date\">Apex Legends gets cross-play, new cosmetics, Flashpoint LTM</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/kuben-blisk-leak\">Titanfall's Kuben Blisk might be a future Apex Legends character</a> ",

Whether it's gas, hellfire, or 'unspecified zone', the ring dictates where the final stages of matches take place, forcing teams to rotate through unfavourable choke points or rewarding those with vantage points in the endgame. The Apex Legends ring, in particular, has its quirks and teams can often make predictions about its final position based on early information. However, as one of the few battle royales with large impassable mountains in the centre of the map and huge areas of steep cliffs and unswimmable ocean at the edges, some players have noticed the final circle can be very unkind. It is not unheard of for the circle to leave teams stranded between a cliff face and the deadly gas, or entirely finish over the ocean. Complaints about these situations affecting <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a> matches regularly hit the official subreddit or go viral on Twitter. However, this was rarely seen in competitive esports tournaments until last week. The final matches of the Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) wrapped up with victories for BlackBird Ventus, LYNX TH, Counter Logic Gaming, and GnaskeStrafeDel.

Rather than everyone being thrown into the same lobbies, console players will only be placed in the PC lobbies if they have a PC player on their team. In a now private TikTok, spotted <a href=\"https://www.dbltap.com/posts/respawn-entertainment-clarifies-cross-platform-play-between-pc-and-console-01ee38cg94t0?utm_source=RSS\">by DBLTAP</a>, Respawn software engineer Jake Smullin talks about cross-play and what that means for console and PC players interacting. To calm players' fears regarding PC players dominating the game, he tells the audience that \"you will only be in PC cross-play lobbies if you have a PC player on your team\". PC players traditionally have an advantage over console players (without aim assist active) in that a mouse grants you better, faster aim - so players have been wondering if this advantage would alter the game significantly. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/cross-play-console-pc-lobbies\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Series 4: Ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/cross-play-release-date-platforms\">Apex Legends cross-play release date and platforms revealed by Respawn</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/skill-based-matchmaking-evidence\">Apex Legends devs have \"concrete evidence\" that skill-based matchmaking works</a> ",

I clearly haven&rsquo;t been paying enough attention, but this is the backdrop to the &ldquo;Lost Treasures&rdquo; event and I&rsquo;m happy to roll with it – not least because that event adds mobile respawn beacons. It goes live at 4pm BST (8am Pacific), and it&rsquo;s bringing loadsa new cosmetics along with a new special room that lets you see other squads on the map. There are quite big character rebalances, too The shotguns &lsquo;n&rsquo; sniper rifles only mode has also returned, but this time with a new item that let you summon a one-use respawn station. I&rsquo;m glad to see those will be added to the main game once the event has run its course. It&rsquo;s been a while since I stretched my Apelegs but a change like this is a fine way to lure me back. <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/06/23/apex-legends-new-event-adds-mobile-respawn-beacons-and-loads-else/#more-852117\" class=\"more-link\"> (more&hellip;) </a> ",

Revealed during this evening's EA Play Live event, the news means those on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC will be able to play together, starting sometime this autumn. Oh, and so will Switch players, as Apex Legends is also arriving on both Switch and Steam this year. Respawn initially confirmed it had plans for cross-play in an <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-04-respawn-explains-apex-legends-surprise-release-and-why-there-are-no-titans\">interview with Eurogamer at launch</a>, with lead producer Drew McCoy explaining cross-progress and cross-purchases would never be implemented \"due to the way systems were set up early on\" which \"can't reconciled after the fact\". Things went quiet on the cross-play front for a while, but in April the devs popped up to say the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-04-05-console-crossplay-is-important-to-apex-legends-says-respawn\">feature was \"important\" to the game</a> - and, well, here it is. We don't yet know the full specifics of how it will work, however, such as whether it will be input-based. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-06-18-apex-legends-finally-gets-cross-play\">Read more</a> ",
