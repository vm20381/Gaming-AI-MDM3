They can be purchased through the newly added shop. Various Performance Updates And Improvements Tutorials Update We have updated the tutorials to reflect the new & altered gameplay mechanics discussed below. We recommend that both new and returning players visit to see what has changed. Universal Gameplay Changes Thank you for continuing to support Idol Showdown. We have been working hard on delivering a new Idol Showdown experience based on player feedback. This update is a major revision to almost all aspects of the game. Our goals with this update include: Encouraging more interactive play through: Providing more defensive options. Reducing the number of “checkmate” situations. Creating a less volatile and more stable game. Improving balance between characters. Improving balance within a character’s kit by nerfing dominant and oppressive tools while also buffing underutilized options. Lots of changes have been made within Idol Showdown: Next Fes — too many to easily fit into patch notes. Much of the frame data within the game has changed, so we’d like to ask our players to explore themselves to find out exactly what is different. Throughout these patch notes we will highlight the biggest changes within the Next Fes update. New Mechanic: Super Chat Reversal While blocking, if you hold forward and press M and H at the same time, you can do an invincible attack mid-block that does no damage but pushes the opponent back. This costs two superchat bars. This gives an additional option to get out of an opponent’s pressure. New Mechanic: Jab chains You can chain light attacks into themselves - even on whiff. Certain characters will have different limits on how many times they can chain jab into itself. New Mechanic: Invulnerable Backdashes Backdashes now have full invulnerability on startup up to a certain point. This can help escape some oppressive situations. New Mechanic: Additional Simple inputs You can now perform different strength variants of special moves by pressing the special button in addition to the strength of the special move you desire. For example, if you are playing Korone and hold back and press special and heavy at the same time, you will get EX chainsaw. Various other universal changes General Balance Changes You are no longer able to combo off of one meter frame 1 invincible moves. You cannot superchat cancel or call a collab during a frame 1 invincible or armored move. Moves with frame 1 armor now lose their grab protection on wakeup. Generally, EX moves that provide frame advantage on-block have had their advantage dramatically reduced. OTG moves now have an IPS limit of one. After a move hits OTG, the opponent will be sent instantly into the IPS state. Moves with disjointed hitboxes have been given proper hurtboxes with a few exceptions. There are no longer any frame 1 head invul moves. The fastest head invul moves in the game now come out on frame 3. Now, when performing an instant block, the rewarded superchat will vary depending on the damage of the move blocked. Burst has a slower startup but a slightly bigger hitbox. Grabs have a shorter range. Grab tech has a longer time before both players can act again, increased pushback, and increased superchat gain. Frame data of all universal overheads has been standardized. When moves are blocked in the corner, they now have more pushback. Other Changes You can no longer steal the corner by jumping into the corner. There is now a buffer for being able to perform dashes. This should help with micro dashes in certain combo routes, notably Ollie’s. An additional visual effect has been added: a lightning effect to signify moves with unusually long hitstun. New Character: Ninomae Ina’nis Witty Artistic High-priestess Ina is a midrange charge character who controls space with her tentacle attacks. She unleashes latent power from the Ancient Ones when the opportunity arises, leaving her opponents without an inkling as to what hit them. Something unique to Ina is that she has visual indicators for when she has charged her charge attacks. If you have down charge, the halo will glow. If you have back charge, the book will glow. Existing Character Changes Fubuki We wanted Fubuki to be a versatile well-rounded character with a particular strength in patient, reactive play. While Korone was shaped to be more pressure-focused, we wanted to emphasize Fubuki’s power in neutral. In addition, several changes were made to help Fubuki make better use of her Idol Skill. These changes help Fubuki feel more distinct as a character and also help compensate for some tools Fubuki lost due to universal system changes. Highlights New Mechanic: When performing a special move using simple inputs, the move will never be an SSR. This allows players to hold onto stocked Burger Fox or Pity SSRs while still having access to Fubuki’s non-SSR specials. Fubuki’s Burger will now grant 2 guaranteed SSR charges instead of 1. However, Fubuki is now capped to holding only 2 guaranteed SSR charges at once. SSR QCB: The SSR variants of the move will now cause a wallsplat instead of wallbounce when performed near the corner, and no longer cause a midscreen side-swap. This will prevent the juggled opponent from being put into impossible follow-up positions when the SSR occurs at specific parts of the screen. SSR DD L/M: Frame 1 full invulnerability removed. Changed to reflect non-SSR DD L/M head invulnerability frames. Korone Changes with Korone are focused on making her less “all-around” powerful and more focused. Korone is currently a strong character due to her high damage and oppressive pressure. However, Korone also has very strong neutral and defensive options, making her overshadow many other characters. In this update, we wanted to provide Korone more of an identity as well as give other characters a chance to shine. We are doing this by accentuating Korone as a powerful offensive pressure character, while nerfing her neutral and defensive game. Highlights New Super Input: Korone can now access her supers separately with QCF S and QCB S. QCF S performs her X-potato super directly without performing the uppercut super on whiff. QCB S triggers the uppercut super which is fast and retains invul frames. Korone’s DD S will no longer cost any meter. This gives Korone a very powerful tool in both pressure and in combos. Korone’s 5M now has an extended hurtbox and less forward movement, pushback, blockstun, and frame advantage in order to make the move less abusable. Korone’s Chainsaw special moves have been significantly reworked and also have new sprites. The most significant changes include: All chainsaws have increased recovery time Light Chainsaw no longer has any projectile invulnerability Heavy chainsaw has increased startup. They also deal more chip damage than before. Suisei We imagine Suisei as a powerful pressure character with an oppressive vortex and among the strongest offense in the game. However, as a tradeoff, Suisei intentionally struggles with limited defensive options. We feel like Suisei meets her intended playstyle well and wanted to preserve this identity in this patch. However, we thought that her game plan was too one dimensional and relied on a few particularly powerful tools. To this end, we made adjustments that buffed and nerfed certain parts of her kit to make her use a wider variety of options in her offense. Highlights In order to preserve her identity as a character with limited defensive tools, Suisei is the only character in the game whose backdash does not have any invul frames. As a tradeoff, she retains her backdash speed, which is now by far the fastest backdash in the game. New Super Input: Suisei no longer needs to install her supers. She can now go directly into both. The forward super is accessed by QCF S and the anti air super is accessed by QCB S. However in exchange she lost all invulnerability on them. QCF H has added armor on top of it, but the armor does not activate immediately. This is to give it more of a use in neutral as well as add an additional call out option for Suisei. QCF L is now more negative on block. Crouching M’s startup has been slowed down and been given a hurtbox during its active frames. In exchange, Standing H now connects from Crouching M even at its furthest ranges. Suisei’s DF M slide has increased frame advantage and a longer duration, giving her another offensive option. Suisei is cute in this update too. すいちゃんはこのアップデートでもかわいい！ Sora Sora is a hybrid setplay/zoner character who also retains decent pressure tools. Although Sora is currently a very powerful character, we wanted to preserve Sora’s identity, as she is also a very unique character.. Therefore, Sora remains relatively unchanged aside from targeted nerfs to her most oppressive and non-interactive offensive options. Highlights Forward M’s hurtbox has been extended and given a much slower startup. QCF L is now a single-hit projectile with a hefty attack level. QCB L/M mines now go away when Sora is hit. Ayame Ayame was previously a character that relied heavily on a few powerful tools such as her DD H invincible reversal, which could be combo’d out of. Due to universal changes to invulnerable special attacks, Ayame lost what was previously a core part of her identity. In order to compensate for this change, we decided to buff other parts of her kit to more evenly distribute her power across her kit. Our goal was to make her feel mostly similar, but use a wider portion of her moveset. Highlights New Rekka Followups Ayame’s Light Rekka Series now has additional followups: M follow-up is a low. H followup is an overhead. The additional follow-ups have been removed from her QCFH rekka series. However, this Rekka now pops up opponents for additional combo opportunities. Jumping Special saw little use. To remedy this, her Jumping Special will now groundbounce when hitting Aerial opponents. In addition we have given it an increased downwards hitbox. Sweep is also a move that saw little use. It has been given additional range as well as been made easier to use in combos. Coco Due to universal changes to OTG, we had to rework some of Coco’s combo structure. As a result some of her moves have fairly different properties.This new combo structure allows Coco to land more fire attacks than before within a single combo.. Due to this, we have added scaling to fire damage when used within a combo. Highlights Sweep now vacuums opponents in, allowing it to be used in combos. QCB M now counts as a projectile, giving it the ability to clash with other projectiles. To replace OTG no longer being able to combo, 22H now applies fire damage. 22G also places the opponent slightly closer to you to help keep Coco’s pressure going. Aki We felt that Aki didn’t have a clear vision and relied too much on gimmicks. In this update Aki has been significantly reworked to fit the role of a proper zoner. Her fireballs were tweaked to cover more approach angles as well as do more chip damage against blocking opponents. In exchange for additional zoning options, we have toned down her ability to mix up the opponent. Highlights New Specials Aki’s projectiles have been reworked. QCF L and M go diagonally downwards at slightly different angles. QCF H is a straight multi hit projectile. The QCB series are now projectiles as well, the L and M version serve as her anti air projectiles. QCB H is a delayed multi hit projectile. Muki moves have been moved to the down down inputs. Aki’s teleports have a new charge motion input (down -> up). In addition they were reworked to move her backwards instead of forwards. EX teleport is now invincible on startup. Aki’s normal attacks have increased in attack level, improving her blockstrings. DD S now has a different buff. Instead of making her projectiles home in, it instead adds an additional hit to her projectiles, giving her an edge in projectile wars as well has giving her better frame advantage on both block and hit. j.2M is now more plus on hit and less punishable on block. Hitting at the right angle allows for followups. Botan Botan has some awkward parts to her kit, but overall is a solid character. Most of Botan’s changes have been made in order to compensate for Botan’s losses due to universal mechanics adjustments. Highlights New Super: Botan has a new super accessed by QCB S. This move has an invincible startup, followed by a barrage of bullets. As a result of the universal changes to frame 1 armor moves on wakeup, Botan's shopping cart is now weak to meaty grabs and cannot be made safe or combo'd off of using Superchat Cancels. The addition of this move provides Botan with a new reversal option as well as an additional option to convert from longer ranged pokes. DD M has received an additional low followup by hitting light. The jump arc of DD M also goes further. Crouching M’s hitbox has been extended. It also has more hurtbox and slightly increased startup to compensate. Grenades now go away on-hit. Pekora Pekora had some really good pressure but suffered from an unbalanced moveset, with certain extremely powerful tools overshadowing other moves. Also due to universal OTG changes, she lost some of her power so changes were made to help keep her OTG useful. These changes were made to reduce her oppressiveness in both her pressure sequences and her zoning. We targeted the most powerful moves in her kit, while also rounding out moves that were previously overshadowed. She is still strong in both areas, but should be easier to deal with. Highlights QCB L: Pekora moves backwards less after launching a rocket. DD H TNT now goes away on hit and has reduced frame advantage. QCB M now puts the opponent into a hard knockdown state when hitting OTG, giving time for a mixup afterwards. QCB H now shoots faster, does more damage, and can now be kicked. The move is also air untechable and as a result should be easier to combo off of. DD L: Can no longer place another TNT while the previous TNT is being kicked or launched. DD S is now air untechable, making it easier to combo off of. Super is now air untechable, which should resolve issues where opponents could hit Pekora even after she lands her super. Ollie Ollie remains mostly the same, with some changes targeting her midrange capabilities. We wanted to make sure that Ollie’s offense remained powerful, but make it more difficult for her to start it. Universal changes also do a lot to make her less oppressive. We’ve also done a few things to aid her quality of life. Highlights: Increased recovery on 3H and 5H, but both have increased hitstun and blockstun to compensate. 5H now connects to her specials that lead to knockdowns at further ranges. DD S now deals recoverable health damage during the initial laser. The big attack at the end still deals normal damage. QCF L hitting grounded opponents now puts them in an air untechable state. Collabs General Collab Changes The following changes apply to all gameplay involving collabs: You can no longer hit L and H at the same time to perform an off-collab; you must use the collab button instead. We removed this macro because we noticed it would often cause players to mis-input Light or Heavy moves when attempting to summon their collab. We have added new moves to some characters which now utilize the QCB S input. As such, call-ins are now performed by holding forward and the collab button at the same time. In order to reduce resource competition between off-collabs and superchat cancel/reversal, the player will now always have 3 maximum bars of superchat. The cost of an off-collab will still vary depending on the collab chosen, and the UI will indicate when they can be summoned. If a player is hit within a short window off time after summoning a collab, it will disappear. We’ve made this change to attempt to provide increased risk and counterplay to utilizing collabs. New Collabs New Collab: Fauna Off Collab: Fauna releases a pulse that pushes the enemy away and turns half the partner's damage taken into recoverable health. Call In: Fauna summons 3 saplings from the ground that pull the opponent closer upon stepping on them. New Collab: Subaru Off Collab: An idol is on the loose... the Oozora Police starts chasing them around, hitting everything in the way. Call In: Subaru slams a big sausage onto the ground, hitting everything on the ground. Existing Collab Adjustments While we still want collabs to play a large role in gameplay, we noticed two consistent issues with them: Collabs were being used as general win conditions in a way that we felt often overshadowed the kits of characters. We’ve attempted to tune collabs such that they now either serve a consistent small benefit, or provide win conditions that can be accessed more situationally. We identified a few collabs (Ame, Miko and Roboco) that were being consistently chosen over the others by almost every character, with the remainder either being niche picks for certain characters or outright ignored. In this patch, we’ve attempted to level the power of all collabs. Mio Call in: Scaling reduced to 1.1x. Marine Off collab: Now costs 2 superchat bars. Off collab: No longer puts the opponent in hitstun. No longer gives the opponent increased chip damage. Now reduces the opponent’s movement much more even including certain mobility special moves. Kanata Off Collab: now costs 3 superchat bars. Call In: Reduced range. Risu Off Collab: Now costs 3 superchat bars. Off Collab: Greatly increased hitstun and blockstun on nuts. Call In: Now has normal scaling (0.85x). Kiara Off Collab: Slightly increased startup time. Call In: Opponent falls out of this move less. Call In: Spawns closer to the player. Amelia Call-In: Now ground bounces when hitting aerial opponents and puts standing opponents in increased hitstun. Call-In: Reduced startup. Call In: Now has normal scaling (0.85x). Iroha Off Collab: Hitbox extended further down. Moona Call In: Now produces a purple flash on the screen when summoned to help with visibility. Call In: Now has normal scaling (0.85x). AZKi Off Collab: Now costs 2 superchat bars. Off Collab: Has increased range, increased duration, and can debuff opponents on the ground. Call In: Now has normal scaling (0.85x). Kaela Off Collab: Now gives 20% attack and 30% defense as well as lasting longer. Off Collab: The buffs now last for a longer duration. Roboco Off Collab: Interval between missiles is lower now, effectively shortening the duration. Call In: Greatly increased startup. Slightly increased hitstun. Miko Off Collab: Now has a limited range. Has a longer startup before falling. Call In: Increased startup. We wanted to highlight some of the bigger changes that each character received, but even these only account for a small percentage of how each character has been changed to fit within the new system of the game. Online Changes Titles, stickers, and banners display within game lobbies All Elo reset to 1500 Custom border for Elo 3000 and above Decreased the time for match timeout, preventing hard freezes when an opponent disconnects Pregame and postgame stickers have been added for interaction between matches Added an Elo penalty when quitting during an online match Optimized the artificial delay during frame drops to more accurately calculate the delay Various fixes to ensure lobby connections work as expected Quickplay New option quickplay to automatically match players based on Elo and ranges Includes an indicator when people accept, estimated ping, and search status Option added to switch to training mode as well, and start search from training Virtual Frontier Changes General Change Our goal for Virtual Frontier was to make it more resource management focused and provide players with more meaningful decisions to make, as well as provide the information necessary to make those decisions. In addition, we recognize that Virtual Frontier may be played by players of many skill levels and therefore wanted to add a wide variety of difficulty options and modifiers so players of various skill levels can tune the mode to their liking. New Content New Bosses A Boss character can now be fought at the end of Virtual Frontier run. These bosses offer a unique experience that contrasts with normal fights and can provide a new test at the end of every run. R-Trus Fubuzilla & Kurokami Kronii The boss: “Error Sora” will no longer appear at the end of a Virtual Frontier run, but will still appear as the final boss of Arcade Mode. New Shops In addition, we have added new Shops to the virtual frontier. These shops are intended to allow players to have more control over their Virtual Frontier runs. Shion Shop This shop provides several options to transmute their current items into new items. Players are limited to 5 actions per visit. Enchant: Upgrade an item to another item of a higher rarity, in exchange for a large fee Disenchant: Downgrade an item into one of a lower rarity, but receive Pekos in return. Mutate: Change an item into a random item of the same rarity in exchange for a small fee Rio Shop Rio’s shop allows you to store items in one run and pick them up in a subsequent run. This can be used for highly customized builds or to target difficult achievements. Gameplay Updates We have now added “stat” items that can be received as rewards from fights; these provide the player with small but consistent upgrades to basic attributes. In the last version of Virtual Fronter, we noticed that it was often possible to “snowball” very quickly due to how frequently opportunities were given to pick up new items. We thought that this was good, but should happen further into runs; we hope that ‘stats’ will accomplish this by diluting the frequency of item pickups. We’ve also added a variety of new snacks and accessories to the game, and made balance adjustments to pre-existing items, fights and game economy. Finally, we’ve added several new fights, and made difficulty adjustments to pre-existing ones - including tuning the AI to be susceptible to fewer “degenerate” counterplay strategies. New Difficulty Options Players are now always able to toggle the following options on: Auto-block: This is the old effect of the “Light Armor” item and will automatically block incoming attacks if the player is not performing any action Auto-combo: This is the old effect of the “Glove Cloak” item and will automatically create a combo when mashing the same button. In addition, there are new starting items that allow players to customize their difficulty Light Armor: Reduce incoming damage by 25% Glove Cloak: Increase damage by 30% Plastic Ball: No effect Gladiator Chains: Increase incoming damage by 30%, but increase damage by 20% “Milestones” have been added. Milestones are additional difficulty levels that can be unlocked by completing Virtual Frontier Each new Milestone adds an additional unique difficulty modifier which stacks upon the previous modifier. More Mid-Run information Several changes have been made to help player make more strategic decisions when planning out their Virtual Frontier Runs There are now icons that indicate the “effect” of a reward from a fight. The icon will indicate that at least one reward from that fight will be of a certain type: Sword Icon: Offense items that either directly increase damage or create perform attacks Shield icon: Defense items that can either block damage or heal the player Wrench Icon: Utility items that have a variety of effects such as generating pekos, providing meter and more. Players can now return back to the map screen after selecting a fight. This allows them to choose the preferred fight when given multiple options. After every fight, players will now receive a “Stats” display that shows the performance of their items in the fight. Offense items will display the amount of additional damage contributed by the item Defense items will display either the amount of damage blocked by the item, or the amount of damage healed by the item. Items that hurt the player or reduce damage will be shown with negative values. Players can now see the “seed” of their run. In addition, players can specify a map generation seed when starting a new Virtual Frontier run. Other new Content There are now “stat” items which can be received as a reward from a fight. These stat items provide the player with small, but consistent upgrades to basic attributes New Fights have been added. New Snacks and Accessories have also been added. Balance adjustments have been made to items, fights and game economy. UI Changes New Splash Screen assets New Main Menu assets Settings Menu has been overhauled New Input Selection assets New Tutorial assets New Training Mode assets New CSS assets New gameplay HUD assets New Online lobby assets New Victory Screen comments Audio Changes New Tracks: Violet Blossom (Meconopsis/Kanalumi) Time of Death (Daydream) Flayon X Showdown (Dead World) Kon Kon Beatdown (Kon Kon Beats) Terminal Velocity (Gravity) Kusa Garlic (Halloween Night) Canvas of Journey (Palette) id:ol Battle (id: entity voices) Planting Joy (Let Me Stay Here) World Takeover (Dark Breath) New School Euphoria (ユーフォリア) Next Fes (New Main Theme) Wait, Did This Change?

        "contents": "Patch 3.0.0 Overview This patch is a character update patch focusing on the new Character Ollie. In addition, various new features and bug fixes were also included. It is important to note that this patch is not intended to be a balance patch, and existing characters are generally unchanged. There are plans for a more comprehensive balance update in the future. General Changes New Features New Character and Collabs Added New Playable Character: Kureiji Ollie from Hololive Indonesia Gen 2 has been added to the roster! Ollie is a very high speed, low health character with many opportunities to mix up the opponent. In addition, Kaela Kovalskia from Hololive Indonesia Gen 3 has been added as a Collab Character. Kaela Kaela’s has versatile support abilities that can help the users in both offensive and defensive situations. Off-Collab - Lvl.69 Smithing Grindset - Kaela grants 3 passive buffs to her collab partner over time. She will grant the following buffs in order: Shield: Take no Chip Damage Sword: +10% attack Armor: +10% defense STAR Call-In - Get Some Help! - Kaela winds up a devastating hammer strike that sends the opponent flying. Near the corner, this move will wallsplat. The “Archives” This new feature will save any match the player has played both locally as well as online into a replay file. Players can then view VODS(replays) from the “Archive” option in the training tab. Features included with Archives are: Favorite, Review, or Delete VOD’s from local PvP or Online matches. Filtering and sorting capabilities. Step back & front, play & pause, forward & rewind. Toggle hitboxes and enable/disable HUD elements display. Take control of either character during a VOD to replay scenarios. NOTE: New updates may have a chance of desyncing old VOD’s if character adjustments were made. A warning will be shown when attempting to load an older VOD. Lobby Improvements Since lobbies are our primary online feature. We are adding the following improvements to our lobby system with the Ollie Update. Reduced the performance impact of multiple spectators on players. Lobby members (including host) can freely move between player and spectator positions if they are empty. Hosts can now set up a rotation where the winner stays and the loser leaves. These features can allow a group of people to all play in the same lobby for an extended session and minimize the amount of time needed to leave and create new lobbies. The goal is to reduce unnecessary overhead time to allow players to play as smoothly as possible. KNOWN ISSUE: Spectators can cause synchronization issues, more spectators will increase the chances of it happening. Currently, spectators utilize rollback to spectate, this is a known issue and we are working on a fix for it. Stage Update In preparation for future stages, the stage select screen has been updated to allow for more than six stage options. Adjustments and additions have been made to the following stages: “Moonlit Gates”, “Main Stage”, and “Gang City”. Updated AI The AI has been overhauled to provide a more engaging experience for arcade mode and virtual frontier. In general, easier AI difficulties are now easier than they were before. Harder AI difficulties are now harder than they were before. Ollie can now appear as an opponent in Virtual Frontier and Arcade. AIs will now be less likely to block mixup options such as Overheads, Lows, and Grabs if you have not performed them yet in a match and be more likely to block them the more often you use them. In Arcade, when selecting “easy”, “medium”, “hard”, or “intense” difficulty options, the AI difficulty will now scale as you progress “Classic” Arcade mode reduced in difficulty. Improved AI performance. Training Mode Additional Updates The Training mode has been further expanded. Frame Data meter has a new color Key added. Frame Data Meter has been updated to display additional information regarding startup active and recovery frames. Added option for AI to only block Low, Mid or High attacks. Other Changes When you enter the Infinite Prevention state in midair, a restand state will no longer be forced. “Tiger Knee” inputs are now supported. Added “P1” and “P2” icons over collabs. Loosened the window between when an opponent jumps over you and when you turn to face them. This effectively means players will turn around to face an opponent earlier than they did previously. A voiceline has been added when a Counter is performed. Various General Networking stability adjustments. Character Bugfixes and Adjustments We have a broader balance patch planned for the future. Therefore, changes for existing characters are minimal and encompass mostly visual, bugfix, or quality of life changes. Character Changes Aki BUGFIX - Aki’s floating twintails no longer appear before Aki appears in the intro. Botan BUGFIX - Fixed issue where crouching blocking hurtbox was larger than crouching hurtbox. Super - BUGFIX - Fixed issue where super animation would not disappear upon winning a round. Coco Backdash - Animation updated to better reflect movement. Korone Forward M - Added eekum bokum to Korone 6MM, moved 6MM voice lines to 5L and 5H. All Yubi - BUGFIX - Resolved issue where attacks would whiff against Fubuki when she is performing this attack. Fubuki 5H - BUGFIX - Resolved issue where attacks would whiff against Fubuki when she is performing this attack. Suisei BUGFIX - Resolved issue where Hurtbox while being juggled was inconsistent and would sometimes be smaller. Hurtbox has been standardized to match other characters. QCF Grab - VISUAL BUGFIX - Opponents will no longer flash before they are covered by tetris coffin. Collab changes Miko Off-Collab - Fixed issue where Miko would not stop talking after leaving the stage. ",

Gameplay Bugs: BUGFIX - Fixed an issue where fall speed would change after getting hit. (Please test physics before/after performing certain actions) BUGFIX - Fixed an issue where performing an IPS combo, then triggering a counter hit would result in the counter hit triggering the IPS Early General Net stability improvements Character/Collab Specific Bugfixes: Fubuki - QCB Light - BUGFIX - Fixed an issue where SSR Variant was not projectile invulnerable for the same active frames as the non SSR Variant. Pekora - All TNTs - BUGFIX - Resolved issue where TNTs were not applying Damage scaling. They should now follow standard special move damage scaling. Pekora - Down Down Light - BUGFIX - fixed the sound effect duration to match the actual duration. Moona - Call-In: Now spawns closer to the player who summoned it. This avoids situations where players summon Moona off screen. Call-In also now dissappears when the player is hit. Kiara - Call-in: - BUGFIX - Resolved issue with Kiara spawning above ground. UI: Adjusted several UI sound effects. BUGFIX - Fixed CSS random collab button spoiling the selection with a voice line. BUGFIX - Fixed CSS P2 collab navigation animation Stage: BUGFIX - Fixed an issue with the Aquamarine stage where the stage would appear completely dark.

        "contents": "Patch 2.0.1 Overview Thank you for playing Idol Showdown! We’re happy to see the interest and support our update has received. This patch attempts to correct some of the issues we’ve noticed during the last day or so as people have explored Patch 2.0. System Switched the graphics rendering API. This will hopefully improve GPU usage and help resolve performance issues. New cosplay unlock conditions. Cosplays previously locked behind single player modes (Arcade/Virtual Frontier) can now be unlocked by playing a certain # of multiplayer matches (both online and local count). Online Resolved issue where one player choosing “leave match” while the other chose “rematch” would softlock the game for the player who selected “rematch”. Added set limit to lobby settings. Elo rating will no longer be updated in private lobbies. Resolved issues related to Mio’s off-collab that would cause the game to hard-crash. Audio We’ve reintroduced sound for the following moves/scenarios. Aki QCB + H hit audio Aki 6M voice line / sfx Ayame CSS Announcer Korone DD + M voice line / sfx Sora 2L voice line / sfx Sora 22S voice line / sfx Sora 6H voice line / sfx Combat (Global) All of the following are bug fixes. The second hit of a combo now applies normal in-combo scaling instead of initial hit scaling. Dash momentum can no longer be preserved for another dash. Dashes will no longer begin moving before the dash animation starts. Resolved an issue with the Infinite Prevention System that was causing desyncs. Characters / Collabs All changes made were to either fix bugs or remedy unexpected/unaccounted for behaviors. Aki 5L reverted to hit on frame 6 (it had been accidentally set to frame 7). Ayame Reduced 22 + S hitstun to more closely align with previous values. Azki Off-collab (ERROR) no longer deals hitstun or damage. Coco Burn damage will now increase the burst meter for the person being hit. Cartwheel now requires a hold input. You can no longer let it go mid-animation and then tap it again to grab. Marine No longer blocks/interacts with projectiles. Pekora Aerials now explicitly have the “head” property. All TNT except for EX TNT will now disappear when Pekora is hit. Mortar and mortar projectiles will now disappear when Pekora is hit. Mortar will now only shoot forward (will not shoot enemies who are behind the mortar). 236 + S now deals chip damage. “Glove Cloak” auto-combos are now enabled for Pekora in Virtual Frontier. ",

        "contents": "Summary Thank you for your continued support of Idol Showdown. We are happy to introduce Patch 2.0; the Pekora update! This update focuses mostly on improving our multiplayer experience; both by extending our online features, and through the addition of training tools to help you improve offline as well. The patch also includes major changes to Coco. Changes to other characters are mainly intended to resolve bugs and ensure more consistency between characters. This patch also includes balance changes to collabs. We intend on adding additional features to the single-player experience in future updates. New Features **New Character: Usada Pekora Usada Construction’s Maniacal CEO Pekora is an opportunistic prankster who traps the opponent in her deadly ordnance of explosives, peko. Win hard or lose hard; the tide of battle swings with perfect comedic timing for this carrot-loving girl, peko. New Collab: AZKi AZKi can restrict the opponent's ability to use resources or prevent them from moving freely, opening up offensive opportunities. Off Collab - ERROR A corrupted version of AZKi glitches through her various forms. If the opponent makes contact, they will temporarily be unable to perform STAR specials or Super STAR Specials. STAR Call-in - ZeroGuessr AZKi pulls off a zero-meter guess on the opponent's location and drops a map pin on them. Pinned opponents are briefly rendered stunned but cannot be hit. New Collab: Moona Hoshinova Both of Moona’s abilities can help the user with repositioning and gaining control over the stage. Off Collab - Gravity Moona invokes her divine lunar presence, producing a powerful gravitational force that pulls opponents in. STAR Call-in - High Tide Moona performs a far reaching axe slash on the ground. On hit, she traps them in a lengthy onslaught of aerial slashes. Training Mode: Expanded and Updated We’ve expanded the features of the training mode; this will hopefully help out the many players hard at work labbing their characters. New pause menu with multiple panels for each option New frame meter feature added to help with testing frame advantage. New hitbox/hurtbox display feature in training mode. Training AI can now be set to play individual moves in addition to a pre-recorded demo. This can be used to better test reversal options. New Stages: The Aquamarine, Eternity Bright (updated) - A brand new stage, “The AquaMarine” has been added! The stage takes place aboard Houshou Marine’s (totally real, not virtual) pirate ship, and features multiple variations depending on the selected audio track. The unlockable stage “Eternity Bright” now has more varied art between its different versions. In addition, the stage borders for each variant now have a visual marker to address readability concerns in high level play. Online Expansion We’ve expanded our system to include various quality-of-life features that we hope will make playing online more enjoyable. Added support for spectator mode. This should provide players with the ability to view their peers’ matches, and make streaming tournaments and similar events less cumbersome. Currently, hosts cannot be spectators in their own lobbies. That is an option slated for a future update. Online now includes support for multiplayer lobbies. The lobby owner can rotate who is spectating and playing in each match. Implemented the Elo rating system as a means for players to track their relative experience level against lobby opponents. Added icons to indicate network type. Updated Arcade Mode The arcade mode has been expanded to allow for more replayability. While there haven’t been as many changes to single player modes in recent patches, we are planning on releasing updates in a future patch. In addition to its ‘classic’ mode, we’ve added difficulty selection options to Arcade Mode which allow you to fix the AI opponents’ difficulty levels. Pekora has been added to the pool of opponents. There are now some diverging paths where you can select your next opponent. Character icons have been added to the Arcade Mode “overworld” screen. Scoring logic has been adjusted. Match Settings Added editable match settings for Local PvP and VS AI. Players can now set the following: Round Count Match Timer Health Star Meter Super Chat Controller Support Added support for additional controllers. However, this will require steam controller input to be disabled. Please check your steam controller settings. Audio Added 3 new audio tracks to the new stage The AquaMarine. Fugue in R♭ (Iris) Ahoy! (Ahoy) WAHoy! (Ahoy, Violet) Changes to Existing Content Universal System Changes and Tweaks Improved performance of both offline and online matches. Frames of grab invulnerability after blockstun increased 4f -> 6f. Grab Tech window has been increased to cover 6f before getting grabbed. Grab invulnerability after knockdown has been increased 5f -> 6f. If a grab is a punish or a counterhit, the grab will not be able to be teched. Jumping after running will preserve a small portion of your momentum. All collabs can now be destroyed by a burst. Scaling logic for multi-hit moves has been adjusted. The final damage of all multi-hit attacks should be the same, but the distribution of damage between the hits should be more even. Certain moves may have minor adjustments in damage as a result of the change (between 1-5 dmg change) Punishing an opponent with a grab will now properly be counted as a punish and reward the player with 15 superchats. All standard grabs now have identical frame data. Controller support has been extended to additional controllers. Implemented various general networking improvements. Most Collab call-ins should now apply 85% combo scaling. Visual Changes Added a visual indicator for when a character is hit while in super armor. Added a visual indicator for Fubuki’s Kon’ter. Updated Fubuki’s RateUP VFX. Updated the color scheme for the in-match notifications (Reversal, Invulnerable, Counter, Punish) to align better with the games overall palette. Updated in-match player names to be displayed properly for online matches. Updated the CSS sprite animation to happen after the character is selected as opposed to after the collab being selected. Audio Changes Updated various UI and Menu SFX. Updated misc voice lines and SFX for various characters and collabs. Bugfixes Fixed issue where moves would have 1 less frame of hitstun and blockstun than intended due to the opponent being able to interrupt the final frame of blockstun/hitstun with an attack. As a result of this change, the frame advantage for all grounded moves should now reflect the value indicated for “Frame Advantage” in training mode. Resolved issue where the combo counter would count things as combos that were not actually true combos / were blockable. Resolved issue where collabs (and other projectiles) would hit multiple times during a superfreeze animation. Fixed Issue where after a knockdown you could option select a block and an attack at the same time upon wakeup. Fixed issue where you would be pushed back from hitting an opponent in a corner even when they were not actually in the corner. Fixed issue where summoning a collab near a corner would cause the user to be pushed backwards. Fixed issue when two characters grabbed each other at the same time. Some characters would recover faster. Fixed issue where you could cancel your knockdown with an attack if you landed an attack with a projectile while knocked down. Fixed issue where landing a killing blow with a ground-bounce could result in the opponent being stuck in midair at the start of the next round. Fixed issue where players would remain colored a bit darker after a grab break. Fixed issue where pressing the “Use Item” button after a dash while performing an attack could result in you circumventing the move limit during combos. In addition, it could result in you being unable to cancel from that attack for the rest of the round. Fixed issue where the Main Menu and Stage Select stage videos loading would cause some players to crash. Fixed issues with command list previews where sometimes objects and animations would remain on the screen after selecting a different animation. Character Changes Coco We felt that Coco’s kit did not mesh together. To help resolve this, we added a new mechanic to help Coco use more of her kit. These changes were made to emphasize Coco’s role as a grappler and to incentivize her to use her command grabs. New Mechanic - Burn Effect - Coco can use her fire attacks to build up \"burn damage\", which is converted to true damage when she lands her “dragon drop” command grab. NEW Jumping H - This new jump-in normal was added to help with Coco’s approach. NEW Jumping Down H - Hip Drop - Has the same animation and frame data as her previous Jumping Heavy. Grab - Recovery increased (19f -> 21f). QCF L - Acrobatic Array - Now provides the option for the user to perform a cartwheel without the grab follow-up. Coco will now only execute the grab if the Light button is held down. QCF H - Essence of Advancing Assault - This move now transitions into Coco’s “meme” grab instead of her “dragon drop” grab. QCB L/M - Verbal Roasting (Orange/Blue) - Although the animation may be similar to its previous version, this is effectively a new move, with its frame data and hitboxes drastically changed. NEW QCB H - Essence of Verbal Roasting - The previous version of this EX move was generally underused. It’s now a quick, multi-hitting fireball that can be used by Coco as a counter-zoning tool. DD H - Essence of Insertion: Tail Slam - Increased damage 155 -> 180 Jumping Special - Dragon Glide - BUGFIX - You can now only perform one jumping special per jump. Super - Essence of True Form: Just Like a Dragon - BUGFIX - Armor frames will no longer be active during the recovery animation. All other character changes are bugfixes or changes added to ensure more character consistency. Aki Crouching H - Aki will now be head invulnerable during the startup of the attack. Grab - Recovery increased (14f -> 21f). QCB H - Muki Knock-Up! - As a result of the universal changes to hitstun, both hits of Muki will now properly connect. Muki will now move further forward when performing the attack. Botan Standing Medium - BUGFIX - Fixed issue where interrupting the cancellable recovery animation would result in the next move not being cancellable. Standing Medium - BUGFIX - Fixed issue where later hits of 5M could not be canceled into crouching Medium. Air Grab - BUGFIX - Fixed issue where landing the Heavy followup to 22M would result in the air grab being unable to be canceled into a normal attack. Jumping Special - Bulelt Rain - Will now deal chip damage. QCF H - S.S.R.B. - is now head invulnerable and air unblockable. Explosion is now untechable. Ayame Crouching H - BUGFIX - Fixed issue where only hitting the 2nd hit will result in the 2nd hitbox hitting twice. Grab - Recovery increased (19f -> 21f). Down-Down S - Fixed physics issues with projectiles. Suisei Down-Forward M - Kakero - Hitstun increased (13f -> 14f). In the initial release of the game, this move was able to link into QCF L. However, a subsequent patch unintentionally removed this link. This will add it back in. Grab - Recovery increased (14f -> 21f). Down-Down H - Psycho Hoshispin - No longer has superfreeze frames on activation. Super - SPACE for Virtual GHOST - Changed animation when attempting to perform the attack with insufficient STAR meter. Suisei will now perform her command grab (Tetromino Transhumanism). Super - SPACE for Virtual GHOST - command grab followup no longer has superfreeze frames on activation. Extended invul on command grab by 2f. This should prevent Suisei’s super from trading as often. Super - SPACE for Virtual GHOST - BUGFIX - Resolved issue where Suisei was able to act early out of the command grab followup. Super - SPACE for Virtual GHOST - BUGFIX - Suisei can now cancel into the activation animation from a special move without needing to spend superchats. Suisei is cute in this update too. すいちゃんはこのアップデートでもかわいい！ Fubuki Jumping Heavy - The late hit is now considered an overhead. b]QCB Light - The SSR version will now be a unique move and no longer be identical to the Medium SSR variant. Idol Skill - Resolved issue where the guaranteed SSR after a Burger would sometimes not come out, but the Burger buff would still be consumed. Korone Grab - Active frames reduced (4f -> 2f). Recovery increased to compensate for active frame reduction (19f -> 21f). Jumping H - Removed Minimum height requirement. Startup increased (10f -> 15f). Air Special - DOOG From Above - Inconsistencies with the move interacting with attacks that have head invulnerability have been fixed. Sora Grab - Recovery increased (19f -> 21f). Down Down Special - Rakka-Chan - Shockwave hitbox is now a low. Collab Changes Roboco -Call-In - High-Spec Beam - The beam’s active visual will now extend to match the active hitbox. Its total duration is not changed. - Off-collab - High-Spec Missiles - Can no longer summon Roboco’s call-in while this remains active. Cooldown frames have been extended such that Roboco takes longer to disappear, making it infeasible to summon her call-in while her missiles are still active. Amelia Call-In - Ground Pound - Added 0.75x combo scaling. This is 0.1x higher than the now standard combo scaling of 0.85x for other call-ins. Off-collab - Time Slow - Effect duration reduced from ~8 seconds to ~6 seconds. Marine Call-in - The AquaMarine - Cannon shots will now connect more consistently. Mio Call-in - Full Power Flaming Punch- BUGFIX- The move used to apply 1.2x combo scaling, but the scaling was inconsistent. This change makes the combo scaling application more consistent. Iroha Call-In - Eggplant Slash - Iroha spawns further back and covers an area closer to the player. Will now wallbounce when hitting an aerial opponent. Off-Collab - NinNinjanai - Has been significantly reworked. The patterns of the ninjas are now at fixed positions. On hit, the ninjas will now send the opponent downward, resulting in a ground bounce. Risu Call-In - Isekai Truck - Increased damage (150 -> 260). Off-collab - Nonstop Nuts - Reduced cost (3 bars of SC meter -> 2 bars). Off-collab - Nonstop Nuts - BUGFIX - Resolved issue where the nuts would sometimes fire while the player was being attacked.

        "contents": "Patch 1.3.0 Overview Thank you for playing Idol Showdown! The changes on the Beta branch are now being merged onto the standard release branch. The following is the final patch list. Patch Overview The goal of this patch is to address the most disruptive character issues and establish system changes that can even the playing field across characters. This will help us establish a new baseline from which we can then build upon in subsequent patches. Due to the nature of this patch, it will contain primarily nerfs to problematic moves and strategies. Although there are not many direct buffs to weaker characters, the system-wide changes in this patch are intended to benefit weaker characters. Due to the amount of changes, we wanted to first evaluate the new meta before preemptively changing currently underutilized characters or moves. From that point onwards, we will have a firmer foundation which we can build upon. General Changes New Features and Mechanics We discovered that the system mechanics we had were very skewed against certain characters and playstyles, with certain characters receiving more resources to work with then others. As a result many of these changes are intended to better balance resource-gain and provide all characters similar opportunities. Although we expect there to still be variation across characters, it should be a lot closer than before. New STAR Meter Changes One core issue with character balance and gameplay revolved around STAR meter imbalance. There were two main issues with STAR meter gain that we are aiming to resolve. In the previous version, we felt that STAR meter gain was overwhelmingly skewed towards the winning player, giving the losing player very little to play with. In addition, STAR meter gain was too imbalanced between characters. Many characters with long combos such as Aki and Botan would gain many times more meter then other characters such as Coco. Since the characters with long combos also were some of the strongest characters in the game, this change has a slight balancing effect as well. The new STAR meter will work as follows. Meter gain will now scale down as the combo goes on. Meter gain will be scaled by 0.9x per move in a combo, with a 0.2x minimum meter gain. Meter gain on taking damage and blocking will be significantly higher from before. After performing a STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 60 frames After performing a Super STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 120 frames After performing a Call-In, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 300 frames After performing a Super chat cancel, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 120 frames Dashing will no longer gain meter New Superchat (SC) Meter Changes The Superchat meter has a similar issue to STAR meter gain where the amount gained was too imbalanced between characters. In particular, the “Motion Input” superchat condition needed to be re-evaluated. These changes are also intended to better balance Superchat gain across characters. In addition, we have rebalanced our Superchat conditions and added new conditions in order to encourage neutral play. Finally, we added the ability to gain superchats from Burst in order to provide an alternate use for burst and provide opportunities for interesting decisions The new Superchat values are as follows: Superchats gained from performing Motion Inputs can now vary between Special Moves. Overall, the average amount of SCs gained from motion inputs has been reduced. The average amount gained has been reduced (5 -> 3) Anti Air SCs increased 10 -> 15 Counter Hit SCs increased 5 -> 10 Punish SCs increased 5 -> 15 Grab Break SCs increased 10 -> 15 NEW SC condition for a successful Normal Throw 0 -> 5 NEW landing a Burst on an opponent in neutral will give 2 full bars of SC meter (0 -> 60) NEW landing a Burst on an opponent who you are comboing will give 1 full bar of SC meter (0 -> 30) In addition the following changes were made to the Superchat system. The Superchat banner will now have the money value reflect the actual amount of superchats gained. Idol Skills in general give more superchats than before. Counter Hits, Anti Air and Punish Superchat conditions no longer applies to Projectiles Character HP Values In order to provide our characters a more unique identity, we allowed characters to have different HP values. The new Character HP values are as follows: Aki - 950 Ayame - 950 Botan - 1000 Coco - 1100 Fubuki - 1000 Korone - 1050 Sora - 1000 Suisei - 1000 Other Gameplay Changes Instant Block will now reduce blockstun by 2 frames. When performing a Burst in midair, you will be unable to attack or block until you land on the ground. All bursts now have significantly more recovery 15f to 30f Getting hit during backdash and dash will no longer result in a counter hit. New “Reversal” Indicator when performing an action on the first possible frame after being knocked down. As a general change, invincible reversals that can be comboed off of will now have prorated damage. All HARD knockdown times increased 45f -> 65f. Input Buffer added on Defense (3 frames). This should significantly change how easy it is to punish certain moves. The buffer applies on blockstun and hitstun Other New Features Adjusted Aki’s Voicelines. Adjusted Fubuki’s Voicelines. Adjusted Sora’s Voicelines. Stage preview videos re-enabled. A new Unlock pop up window will appear upon unlocking Cosplay 5 (winning 10 matches with the character in Local VS mode or Online) General Gameplay Bugfixes Fixed Issue where performing a move on Reversal will not auto-orient towards the enemy position. You are now no longer able to summon Collabs during your opponent's grab animations. (Though you can still summon them during your own grab animations). You are now no longer able to summon Collabs during Superfreeze animations. The Collab will instead come out the moment the superfreeze stops. Fixed issue where characters were slightly above ground on round start. Fixed issue where you could perform air attacks on the ground if the attack was performed very low to the ground. Fixed issue where you could grab break with a negative edge input. Fixed issue where bursting a multi-hit attack could result in you being stuck in a hitstun state. Anti Air grabs no longer count as strikes for grab-strike priority. Meaning they no longer have grab invulnerability during active frames. Fixed issue where projectiles would allow you to bypass move cancel priority. Fixed Rollback issue that would occur on KO where the camera would remain zoomed in after a KO. Fixed issue where hits that “locked in '' your position (such as Crouching H’s) could interrupt moves with super armor. Adjusted Down Down Motion Input detection. You can no longer Instant Block attacks with no blockstun. Other Bug Fixes The Mouse cursor will now disappear after 5 seconds of inactivity.

        "contents": "Patch 1.3.0 Overview Thank you for playing Idol Showdown! We have received more playtesting this first month than we had ever imagined. However, a result of this playtesting is that we have uncovered several systems issues and unintended character exploits. The goal of this patch is to address the most disruptive character issues and establish system changes that can even the playing field across characters. This will help us establish a new baseline from which we can then build upon in subsequent patches. Due to the nature of this patch, it will contain primarily nerfs to problematic moves and strategies. Although there are not many direct buffs to weaker characters, the system-wide changes in this patch are intended to benefit weaker characters. Due to the amount of changes, we wanted to first evaluate the new meta before preemptively changing currently underutilized characters or moves. From that point onwards, we will have a firmer foundation which we can build upon. General Changes New Features and Mechanics We discovered that the system mechanics we had were very skewed against certain characters and playstyles, with certain characters receiving more resources to work with then others. As a result many of these changes are intended to better balance resource-gain and provide all characters similar opportunities. Although we expect there to still be variation across characters, it should be a lot closer than before. New STAR Meter Changes One core issue with character balance and gameplay revolved around STAR meter imbalance. There were two main issues with STAR meter gain that we are aiming to resolve. In the previous version, we felt that STAR meter gain was overwhelmingly skewed towards the winning player, giving the losing player very little to play with. In addition, STAR meter gain was too imbalanced between characters. Many characters with long combos such as Aki and Botan would gain many times more meter then other characters such as Coco. Since the characters with long combos also were some of the strongest characters in the game, this change has a slight balancing effect as well. The new STAR meter will work as follows. Meter gain will now scale down as the combo goes on. Meter gain will be scaled by 0.9x per move in a combo, with a 0.2x minimum meter gain. Meter gain on taking damage and blocking will be significantly higher from before. After performing a STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 60 frames After performing a Super STAR special move, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 120 frames After performing a Call-In, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 300 frames After performing a Super chat cancel, meter gain will be reduced to 0.3x for 120 frames Dashing will no longer gain meter New Superchat (SC) Meter Changes The Superchat meter has a similar issue to STAR meter gain where the amount gained was too imbalanced between characters. In particular, the “Motion Input” superchat condition needed to be re-evaluated. These changes are also intended to better balance Superchat gain across characters. In addition, we have rebalanced our Superchat conditions and added new conditions in order to encourage neutral play. Finally, we added the ability to gain superchats from Burst in order to provide an alternate use for burst and provide opportunities for interesting decisions The new Superchat values are as follows: Superchats gained from performing Motion Inputs can now vary between Special Moves. Overall, the average amount of SCs gained from motion inputs has been reduced. The average amount gained has been reduced (5 -> 3) Anti Air SCs increased 10 -> 15 Counter Hit SCs increased 5 -> 10 Punish SCs increased 5 -> 15 Grab Break SCs increased 10 -> 15 NEW SC condition for a successful Normal Throw 0 -> 5 NEW landing a Burst on an opponent in neutral will give 2 full bars of SC meter (0 -> 60) NEW landing a Burst on an opponent who you are comboing will give 1 full bar of SC meter (0 -> 30) In addition the following changes were made to the Superchat system. The Superchat banner will now have the money value reflect the actual amount of superchats gained. Idol Skills in general give more superchats than before. Counter Hits, Anti Air and Punish Superchat conditions no longer applies to Projectiles Character HP Values In order to provide our characters a more unique identity, we allowed characters to have different HP values. The new Character HP values are as follows: Aki - 950 Ayame - 950 Botan - 1000 Coco - 1100 Fubuki - 1000 Korone - 1050 Sora - 1000 Suisei - 1000 Other Gameplay Changes Instant Block will now reduce blockstun by 2 frames. When performing a Burst in midair, you will be unable to attack or block until you land on the ground. All bursts now have significantly more recovery 15f to 30f Getting hit during backdash and dash will no longer result in a counter hit. New “Reversal” Indicator when performing an action on the first possible frame after being knocked down. You can no longer be hit out of a grab tech. As a general change, invincible reversals that can be comboed off of will now have prorated damage. Other New Features Adjusted Aki’s Voicelines. Adjusted Fubuki’s Voicelines. Adjusted Sora’s Voicelines. Stage preview videos re-enabled. A new Unlock pop up window will appear upon unlocking Cosplay 5 (winning 10 matches with the character in Local VS mode or Online) General Gameplay Bugfixes Fixed Issue where performing a move on Reversal will not auto-orient towards the enemy position. You are now no longer able to summon Collabs during your opponent's grab animations. (Though you can still summon them during your own grab animations). You are now no longer able to summon Collabs during Superfreeze animations. The Collab will instead come out the moment the superfreeze stops. Fixed issue where characters were slightly above ground on round start. Fixed issue where you could perform air attacks on the ground if the attack was performed very low to the ground. Fixed issue where you could grab break with a negative edge input. Fixed issue where bursting a multi-hit attack could result in you being stuck in a hitstun state. Anti Air grabs no longer count as strikes for grab-strike priority. Meaning they no longer have grab invulnerability during active frames. Fixed issue where projectiles would allow you to bypass move cancel priority. Fixed Rollback issue that would occur on KO where the camera would remain zoomed in after a KO. Fixed issue where hits that “locked in '' your position (such as Crouching H’s) could interrupt moves with super armor. Adjusted Down Down Motion Input detection. Other Bug Fixes The Mouse cursor will now disappear after 5 seconds of inactivity. Fixed settings option issue with Audio when clicking out of the window. Fixed issue where credits BGM sometimes wouldn’t play. Fixed issue with rebinding 1p and 2p controllers where delete binding and other keys would interfere with players binding. Fixed issue with controllers picking up the wrong binding if a controller gets disconnected. Fixed issue with UI sometimes showing improper controller for gamepad. Fixed issue with Loading Videos causing crash issues on certain computers. Fixed training mode reload bug where dummy record could cause player to reload in wrong position. Fixed issue where unlocking cosplay 5 through online matches would unlock cosplay 5 for every character instead of just for the played character. Character Bug Fixes and Adjustments Character Changes Aki Aki ended up being much more powerful than intended. Our current direction for her is to focus on her zoning strengths while toning down her other strengths. As such, we nerfed her approach, mixup, and pressure tools, and made her DDS a more cohesive part of her zoning gameplan. We also tweaked her other zoning tools to make more interesting zoning than what previously existed. We would like to see how well these changes align with this new Aki playstyle, and evaluate her current power level. Crouching M - No longer jump cancellable. Crouching Forward M - Aki-Chopper- No longer jump cancellable, but is now special cancellable Jumping M - Reduced horizontal range. More landing recovery 3f -> 6f. Jumping Down M - Aki-Drill - Blockstun increased by 2 frames. All QCF Specials - Increased recovery from 20f -> 27f. All QCF Specials - Projectiles will now disappear upon contact with the opponent. QCF L - Good Boy - Adjust angle of projectile to be lower, making it worse at covering aerial approaches. QCF M - Bad Boy - Adjust angle of projectile to be higher and extended upwards hitbox, making the projectile better at covering aerial approaches. The projectile has also been slowed down. All Muki Specials - All Muki related moves will now have Muki disappear if Aki is hit. QCB M - Muki Pound! - Startup increased by 1 frame. Recovery increased by 6 frames, and chip damage reduced 20 -> 10. QCB M - Muki Pound! - New Effect, Aki will now knock the opponent towards her. This will mean Aki will sacrifice space upon hit/block. This is intended to make Aki need to more carefully consider when to summon Muki. All Teleport Specials - Startup increased 9f -> 14f. DDL/M/H - Elven Flash (all grounded variations) - Invincibility frames reduced 9f -> 2f. DD LHold - Elven Flash (all variations) - Recovery is now slower then the Tap variant by 5f. All Hold Variants of Teleport - All kicks will now have ‘head’ property. This would result in the kicks whiffing on characters who are performing their Down H attacks. All Hold Variants of Teleport - Visual Hitstop increased 20f -> 24f. Jumping S - Going Down - Invincibility Removed. Idol Skill - Hypnotic Hips - Now grants 5 superchats on use. Startup reduced 85f -> 45f. Idol Skill - Hypnotic Hips - New effect. Instead of granting the homing ability for the next Good Boy/Bad Boy projectile, it will now make all projectiles for the next 360f have the homing ability. Ayame Overall, Ayame is playing similarly to how we intended. However, we feel that she has some noticeable quality of life issues. As such, our focus for her is to give her some changes to reduce the amount of frustration while playing her. Hurtbox - Ayame’s hurtbox while being juggled will now the same as other characters Crouching H - Now Air unblockable and is ‘head invulnerable’, meaning it cannot be hit by most air attacks. All QCF Specials - Will now provide superchats for each motion input of the rekka. The amount given will decrease for each subsequent attack of the rekka. The exact amount given is different depending on the variant used. All QCF Specials - BUGFIX: resolved issue where you would continue the rekka when attempting to Superchat cancel into a different special move. QCFL - Asura’s Fury (close) - 2nd Hit will move Ayame forwards more, allowing her to more consistently connect the 2nd hit after the first hit. The third hit of the rekka will also move forwards less. QCFH - Rakshasa’s Wrath - The final hit of the mid ender will now have less recovery 38 -> 27. All QCB Specials - Oni Flip (far) - Flip arcs have been adjusted. Can now superchat cancel after landing on the ground. QCBL - Oni Flip (close) - Will now be more safe on block (-1f or -2f depending on spacing). Jumping Special - Heavenly Oni Flip- Increased Hitstun and increased size of downwards hitbox. DDH - Shin Demon Cutter - Now applies 50% damage proration on hit. Idol Skill - Karma and Shiranui - Now generates 10 Superchats on use. Botan Botan is meant to be a high risk/ high reward character. In the previous version of the game, we felt that Botan had no clear weaknesses. Her reward was really high, but her risk was not as high as we intended. As such, we decided to increase the amount of risk on some of her most oppressive options which some other characters had little to no options to deal with. In addition, we decreased the reward on her Idol Skill which is used as her escape/reversal option. Standing M Followup - Recovery frames increased 18f -> 26f. Hitstun and blockstun also increased. (Hitstun: 22f -> 26f) (Blockstun 14f -> 24f) Jumping H - Increased Landing Recovery 4f -> 7f Jumping H - New Properties, will now only be a single hit instead of a multihit. Jumping Down H - Lead Curtain- Increased Landing Recovery 4f -> 10f, visual hitstop reduced. Universal Overhead -Hitstop adjusted to be -1 on block. (from +1) QCFL - Poi (high) - Now Limited to one L Grenade on screen at a time. QCFM - Poi (low) - Now Limited to one M Grenade on screen at a time. QCBL - Quickscope (low) - Low profile is now consistent with the Roll followup Low sniper (low profile begins on frame 4). Projectile now spawns further forwards. QCBM - Quickscope (high) - Will now whiff on crouching players outside of point blank range. Idol Skill - Trials Ascending - Startup Increased 2f -> 5f. Now gives 5 Superchats on execution. Idol Skill - Trials Ascending - The properties of the attack here changed. It will now be a hard knockdown on the final hit. This means you can no longer get a free follow up. However, her Idol Skill is now counted as “Special'' cancel priority. This means you can still spend Superchats to follow up from the attack. Coco We felt that Coco was not performing the way she should in the previous version of the game. In this update, we gave her some small quality of life updates. While we realize these changes seem very insignificant, we’re working on a Coco rework. This includes a new mechanic for her which will be released in the next major update. Thanks for your patience Tatsunoko. Standing M - Will now force stand on hit. Increased Hitstun (23f -> 26f) and Blockstun (16f -> 20f) QCFH - Essence of Advancing Assault: Dragon Drop - Removed Superfreeze frames Jumping Special - Dragon Glide- Can now be canceled starting at frame 20. Minimum Height added. Fubuki Aside from some extremely strong techniques, we’re mostly satisfied with how Fubuki worked in the previous version of the game. As such, we’re adjusting how her instant overhead works, and tuning some of her other moves to be easier to deal with for other characters. Standing M - Increased pushback on block Jumping H - Will now have a sourspot with weaker properties to the original hit. The Sourspot has the following properties: Reduced Damage (90 -> 60), no longer knocks opponents into the ground, no longer ground bounces, smaller hitbox that cannot cross up. Sweep - Now moves Fubuki forwards slightly SSR QCF L/M - Oruyanke - Now knocks opponents down instead of launching them up. QCF H - Kon-Cob - Now knocks opponent down on the second hit. All Jumping Special Variations - Aerial Blizzard- Decreased size of second hitbox, Reduced pushback on block Jumping Special - Aerial Blizzard - First hit of non lucky variation hitstun reduced from 60f -> 15f. Using only the first hit off of instant overhead now leaves Fubuki punishable on hit. Fubuki retains the ability to combo off of the instant overhead off of the lucky verison of this move SSR Jumping Special - Aerial Blizzard BUGFIX: Resolved issue with “blue hitstun” causing the opponent to be stuck if the move was interrupted. DDH - Shin Yukkuri Flip - Now applies 50% damage proration. Idol Skill - Burger Fox - Now grants 10 Superchats on use. Korone While we feel that Korone is not extremely strong in the previous version of the game, she did have strategies which were impossible to deal with for some characters. In some matchups, Korone could get into range of her standing M and repeatedly use this move with little counter-play. We adjusted the properties of standing M to allow for counterplay. To balance out this change, we increased her reward on hit by reducing the scaling on her air chainsaw. We also gave the first part of her forward M target combo a lower cancel priority, opening up new conversions and combo routes. Standing M - Extended Hurtbox stays out for Slightly longer, Increased pushback on block.. Recovery increased by 2f. Blockstun increased by 1f (net advantage change is -1 from before) Crouching M - Increased range with adjusted animation, increased pushback on block. Sweep - Low profile now starts on frame 4 (instead of frame 1) Forward M - The first hit now has “M’ cancel priority. Jumping Special - DOOG from Above - Reduced the effects of Damage scaling (75% -> 85%) Jumping Special - DOOG from Above - Landing Recovery reduced 10f -> 7f. It is still minus but not as punishable DDH - Super Koro Punch 64- Now applies 75% damage proration Idol Skill - Doggy Dash - Now grants 10 Superchats on use. Sora Sora’s changes are mostly centered around increasing quality of life rather than balance, as we wanted to see how Sora was affected by the changes to other characters. We however, realized that Sora’s A-egis Reflector move was unintentionally causing trade situations that nullified the opponent’s offense, so we adjusted the move to be more interruptible. Sora also received a new special move that she can perform in the air to give her more flexibility. Standing H - Significantly increased range. Reduced knockback Crouching M - Increased horizontal range on both hits Sweep - Now combos into Re:Play mine detonation DDM - A-egis Reflector! - A-Chan will now appear later and go away upon Sora being hit New Aerial Special - Sky:Play - Sora will now be able to manually detonate her Mines while in mid air. Attempting to detonate mines in mid air with no mines out will result in a failure animation. Idol Skill - Rakka chan - Juggle trajectory adjusted for consistency. Recovery reduced to 20f. Range decreased. Initial hitbox removed Suisei Since Suisei’s current position is generally stable, we wanted to see how she was affected by changes to other characters and systems before making any major adjustments. Jumping Special - Stellar Slice- Now counts as a head attack and will whiff against 2H attacks. Added landing lag 0f -> 6f kyou mo kawaii Collab changes Risu We feel that Risu was underperforming, so we let her run you over with her truck while you’re on the ground. We also buffed the consistency of her nuts. Off-Collab - Non-stop Nuts- Only Crouching H will send the nuts upwards STAR Call-In - Isekai Truck - Will now hit OTG Marine Off-Collab - Hugging Pirate- Now starts from further behind. Kiara Kiara’s call-in was meant to be a combo tool, but the untechable time on the juggle was so low that it was hard to use it this way. The attack is now untechable, and has a larger window to follow up with juggles. STAR Call-In - Hinotori- Will now launch opponents much higher and can no longer be air-teched. Kanata STAR Call-In -50kg Grip - Removed superfreeze frames ",

We're sorry that this happened and we'll do our best to adapt our patching strategy so this doesn't happen again. Moving forward, we're going to open a public beta testing branch on steam, and most patches will be released on this branch at least 1 week before the main game gets any changes. The patch that we released today will be reverted on the main build and be moved to that branch. When we get the new beta branch ready, we'll post instructions on how to access it, as well as more details on how we'll conduct the betas.

        "contents": "Thank you for Supporting Idol Showdown! We have been overwhelmed by the amount of support we've been getting and have been hard at work at fixing issues. This patch is intended to be focused on fixing issues and introduce a change to our Air Tech and Note: A version 1.1.0 was briefly released that was reported to cause input issues for certain controllers. This patch should disable a recent change to input rebinding until the issue is resolved. We apologize for issue. Features General Features: Lobbies - Added ability to assign a tag to a Lobby Possible tags are: none, newcomer, casual, veteran, god Lobbies - Added ability to filter lobbies based on tags. Online - added GGPO Frame Delay option Training Room - Frame Advantage - this feature is currently a work in progress and is known to be inaccurate for ground/wallbounces (such as Aki’s Standing Heavy). Gameplay Features: Teching: Air Tech and Ground techs are now performed by holding any attack button when a tech is possible. You are still able to influence the direction of an air tech by holding the respective direction while teching After an Air Tech, you are now invulnerable until hitting the ground OR performing any aerial action Infinite Prevention System (IPS) When IPS invulnerability is triggered in midair, you are now invulnerable until either teching or hitting the ground. This contrasts with the old IPS System, where invulnerability would run out as soon as the tech window began. Bugfixes General Bugfixes System Mechanics - STAR Meter - Fixed issue where having exactly 250 meter would not allow you to perform an EX move. System Mechanics - Burst - Fixed issue where Burst would not cancel out knockback momentum Stage - Fixed bug where certain combos could not be performed on the Idol Showdown Stage. Now all stages should be identical. Tutorial - Bugfix where Superchat cancel and Combo into specials tutorials would sometimes not pass the player when the condition was performed. Fixed issue where frame data could be inconsistent at the start of a match General Online stability updates General Localization and text fixes. Gameplay Bugfixes For this patch, our focus was on resolving attacks or character gameplay mechanics that were not working as intended and fixing bugs. Balancing adjustments will come in a future patch. Fubuki: Lucky DD Heavy - SSR Yukkuri Flip- Now is Air Unblockable, just like the other versions of Pachi Lucky QCB - Grounded SSR Blizzard Swirl - Now has projectile invulnerability frames that match the other versions of Blizzard Swirl Lucky QCB - Grounded SSR Blizzard Swirl - Fixed bug where attempting to Burst the lucky tail swirl would leave the opponent unable to move. QCF L/M- Oruyanke (all variants) - Fixed issue where Hitstun and Blockstun were incorrectly set far below the intended values Suisei: Standing Medium - Resolved bug where Hitstun and Blockstun could be very inconsistent. Sora QCF Medium - On Stage! (High) - Fixed issue where the Blockstun was higher than hitstun. DD Medium - A-egis Reflector! - Fixed issue when reflecting Ayame’s Ghost where even after reflect you would still be cursed Botan Jumping Heavy - Fixed issue where normal could deal chip damage. Jumping Down Heavy - Lead Curtain - Correct sprite offset to better reflect Hitbox and Hurtbox. Jumping Down Heavy - Lead Curtain - reduced visual hitstop Aki Air Special - Going Down - Removed STAR meter gain on execution. This will now match the STAR meter gain of Aki’s other teleport special moves QCF Medium - Bad Boy - Fixed bug where the move was not obeying projectile limits. It will now behave similarly to Good Boy Korone Forward Medium - Orayo! - Will now connect both hits more consistently Stand Medium - Fixed issue where normal could deal chip damage Coco: DD Heavy - Essence of Insertion: Tail-Slam - Fixed issue that was causing the opponent to be sent much further than expected. Virtual Frontier Bugfixes Collections Screen - Fixed issue where the Collections screen would sometimes display only the KFP bucket ",
