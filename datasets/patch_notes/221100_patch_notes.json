        "contents": "Hello, Survivors! We’re thrilled to announce the release of update 1.27! This is our first stable update of 2025. It marks an important milestone for the year ahead. As with similar updates in the past, this one focuses heavily on stability improvements, bug fixes, and other necessary refinements based on player feedback. But that’s not all. Following the scale of our last update, we couldn’t resist adding a few exciting changes as well! Those of you who participated in the update’s experimental phase may already be familiar with the improvements we made to DayZ Frostline’s general environment and gameplay mechanics. We revamped navigation across the eastern and southern coastlines, introduced new snowy variants of broken-down houses, and tweaked several important survival mechanics to ensure a fresh and dynamic experience on Sakhal. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/21d2b268b754b14dd58ccf97a8d35cffc7c8f497.jpg Here are some of the most notable additions and improvements in update 1.27: New Locations on Sakhal and Improved Map Navigation: The eastern coast is now better populated with expanded cities, villages, and smaller landmarks, while a major new point of interest on Shantar Island introduces exploration opportunities and a simple new gameplay mechanic. Fishing & Survival Adjustments: Fishing has been rebalanced; it now takes longer with incomplete tools. We also reworked the bloody hands and food poisoning mechanics, with different infections now linked to specific types of animals. Customizable Boat Decay System: To prevent boats from accumulating in inaccessible places, we’ve introduced a boat decay mechanic which is fully configurable by server owners. Expanded Backpack Storage: New tool slots have been added to most backpacks; we've generalized the glowstick and radio slots, allowing for more diverse item usage. Sound & Immersion Upgrades: Balanced footstep audibility - especially in forests, where stepping on clutter adds an extra layer of environmental depth. New character sound effects, including chattering teeth when cold. Gunfire sound tweaks for submachine guns, along with reworked bullet cracks. New Particle Effects: From snow falling off trees when shaken to vomiting, breath vapor, and bleeding effects, many visual elements have been reworked for added realism and polish. There’s still much more to uncover in update 1.27! For a full list of changes, including more audio updates and performance optimizations, we encourage you to visit our official forums, where you’ll find a detailed breakdown in the patch notes. Wipe News: To maintain a fresh and balanced experience for all players, we will be performing a full wipe on all platforms with the release of update 1.27. This includes all maps and characters. The reset ensures a clean slate and an equal start for everyone as we move forward in 2025. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/dd680fe2e3b8b6ed71c330309e6c694539552350.jpg DayZ in 2025 As we kick off the new year with update 1.27, we also want to give you a glimpse into what’s ahead for DayZ in 2025. This year will be an important one for DayZ, as we continue our commitment to regular updates while working on some of our most ambitious plans yet. Our focus remains on expanding and refining the core experience, ensuring longevity and continued engagement for long-time players and new survivors alike. While we don’t want to go into too much detail just yet, here are some of the key areas we aim to explore through our upcoming updates: Gunplay refinements – featuring improvements to scopes, new firearms, and weapon handling Quality-of-life and performance enhancements – addressing community feedback, bug fixes, and optimizations Expanded dynamic events for Sakhal – bringing more variety and unpredictability to the world of DayZ A refreshed experience – updates to the main menu interface to improve navigation, news/announcement delivery and accessibility We have much more in store, and while we’re not ready to reveal everything just yet, we can say with confidence that 2025 will be a major year for DayZ. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to sharing more details as the year progresses Stay tuned for future updates. And, as always—thank you for surviving with us! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/0802714ec87a01fb4633f1b36eb2bed3547b802c.jpg Events We didn’t host a Valentine’s Day event this year, as its timing conflicted with the release of update 1.27. Instead, the next seasonal event will be Walpurgis Night. Looking ahead, you can expect the return of our usual special events, including Walpurgis Night, Halloween, and Christmas —each carefully crafted to enhance your DayZ experience. We’re also exploring the possibility of collaborating on new events with other games. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/7b1637b29dbad22c193b9ecc5ed40bf031ef7231.jpg That concludes DayZ in 2025. We’re enthusiastically anticipating a year filled with remarkable journeys, and we sincerely hope that you will join us in experiencing the continued evolution of DayZ.

The first milestone of the new year is here - the experimental release of game update 1.27! As with previous first-of-the-year updates, the focus is primarily on the stability of the build, as well as various internal tools and processes that will help us prepare for the rest of the year. Considering the scale of our previous update, however, we couldn't leave things totally untouched. So we made a few changes and additions based on our data and your feedback. Here are some of the improvements we made to DayZ Frostline: We reinforced the eastern coast with more places to loot. Aniva city has been expanded, Baikovo hamlet has been turned into a village, and other smaller locations have been added along the eastern coast. The main island of Sakhal has been populated with more new snowy variants of broken down houses, which offer loot opportunities in the wilderness. Navigation between the vast sea ice plains has been simplified thanks to the addition of buoys and small military outposts which can be found on small islands, primarily around the island of Burukan. A minor deforestation pass was conducted on Burukan island in order to make the area a bit more dangerous to move around in. New static outdoor thermometers were added to Sakhal; curious players can now understand why their characters are freezing, even when the weather appears sunny and warm. Lastly, we added a major point of interest on the southern island of Shantar, and coupled it with a simple game mechanic as well. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/046fcf779ac9bb0545741aa54151e6c33309709a.jpg If you’re a fan of the changes we made to bandaging (i.e. the ability to bandage multiple bleeds with the single hold of a button), then you’ll be happy to hear that we have implemented the continuous factor to more actions, such as repairing. Domestic animals like cows, goats, and sheep are now more likely to run away than before. Speaking of animals, we also looked at your feedback on fishing and decided to make an additional balancing pass. Fishing takes longer and is less effective now with incomplete fishing tools. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/ecb829848b058fdf8586ddad93a5c01467b5b737.jpg We also took a look at the mechanics behind bloody hands and food poisoning while cutting up freshly obtained fish. Bloody hands will now result in different diseases depending on which animal was processed. For example, bloody hands from fish will almost always give food poisoning now, and not salmonella as before. It’s still highly recommended to wash your hands before eating, though some animals aren't as dangerous as before. Meanwhile, food poisoning has been reworked to reflect different types and quantities of food more accurately. It will no longer decay on its own. Rather, it will now disappear slowly as a player battles its symptoms. One of the things we anticipated when we added boats to the game was that they would be left in places that are hardly accessible without the use of another boat. To make sure new boats continue being spawned, we implemented a boat decay mechanic, which is fully configurable on the server-side as well. Furthermore, as a follow-up to update 1.26’s inventory cargo size reduction pass, we decided to increase your ability to carry a bit more with the addition of new tool slots to most backpacks. We also generalized the glowstick and radio slot, which now accept both, as well as more items! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/082862ef0f2532856b1ca25ad673da9e94e84b67.jpg The audio side of the game received a lot of attention as well: We heard your feedback regarding the boat audio and overhauled the audibility from both close-up and far points of view. We balanced the audibility of character footsteps by boosting the middle range so they would be more audible and not get lost in the mix of the environment’s sounds. Some surfaces (like forests) now have the additional sound effect of stepping on clutter. Adding to the intensity of your survival struggles, you can now hear your character’s teeth chattering while they’re cold. Bullet cracks were reworked and all submachine guns had their shot and tail sounds updated. Sakhal also received a number of tweaks to environment sounds. An example of this would be the fact that when a character walks through an evergreen tree (with branches on the ground), it will make a sound. We believe this is going to be a healthy change to PvP interactions, particularly on Sakhal where these trees are plentiful. We also focused on various particle effects. There are Sakhal-specific ones, like snow falling off trees when interacting with them, as well as one for explosions on snow. Considering our recent focus on the cold weather, we couldn’t help changing the breath vapor effect, so we completely reworked it. That led us to updating vomit and bleeding effects. Finally, a number of our firearms received brand new particles. We’re certainly not done working on firearms and hope to make more changes in the future. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/066f54e42ab44e43668d93c1d802555a5c1c1041.gif Last but not least, for anyone who’s ever tried to re-texture a certain vanilla item and found that some just do not work: we updated a large number of our assets to support re-texturing using configs. If you find any more issues with this, or with anything else mentioned in this article (or in our usual forum change notes), please report your findings to our feedback tracker. You can do so easily by using the feedback tracker link implemented in the game menus. You can find the change logs here! Thank you and see you on Sakhal! On behalf of the DayZ team, Adam",

The festivities will run from December 17th to January 7th. Let’s get into all the goodies we’ve prepared for you.  Christmas Trees and Gifts The beloved singing Christmas trees are making their return! You’ll find them scattered across villages and towns on all three maps. We won’t spoil the fun by revealing their exact locations—you’ll need to go out and explore! Each tree will feature gift boxes filled with goodies like food, Christmas-themed clothing, ammo, and more. As usual, opening these boxes will grant you gift wrap, which you can use to repackage a gift of your choice for a fellow survivor. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/58f96186f6e338d4a1a45541c2ef4863799ccbe8.jpg Santa’s Sleigh Crashes Santa’s sleigh dynamic crashes are also back and, for the first time, will appear on Sakhal alongside Chernarus and Livonia. Rest assured, these festive crashes won’t replace regular helicopter crashes on Chernarus and Livonia. In fact, they’ll even include loot from standard heli crashes! There is also an additional incentive to hunt down these sleigh crashes, especially on Livonia and Sakhal. They will include keys to endgame items like punch cards on Livonia and scientific briefcase keys or glow plugs on Sakhal. As you journey through the forests of Chernarus, the plains of Livonia, or the ice sheets of Sakhal, keep your ears open for the magical sounds of sleighs crashing and your eyes peeled for the glowing blue light. Let the hunt begin!  {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/c36ad25f3d2d9968b31fc35a70efb867243ed4bf.jpg Reindeer Take Over Speaking of hunting, we wanted to bring the spirit of Christmas to life, so we replaced all the deer on Chernarus and Livonia with reindeer. Even better, there’s a special reindeer with a glowing red nose and Christmas lights tangled in its antlers! Keep an eye out for this festive creature who might be found near sleigh crashes or roaming amongst a herd of reindeer. We’re rooting for his survival after the crash, or even against the infected Santa! Otherwise you’re in for a free loot of Christmas light. Seasonal Cosmetics All your favorite Christmas cosmetics are back, including headbands, seasonal eye masks, Santa hats, Santa beards, Morozko hats, and Christmas gloves. We’re also introducing three new “ugly” Christmas sweaters with DayZ-themed slogans. We hope these additions bring a festive touch to your survival wardrobe.  {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/c2004a3c235201dca4ea9709ae47a0afef9c99b6.jpg Candy Canes The magical, oh-so-nutritious candy canes are returning! These sweet treats could prove invaluable in harsher environments like Sakhal’s inland regions where food is scarce.  A Frosty First with Frostline This year marks the first ever white winter Christmas in DayZ, thanks to the addition of Sakhal. We can’t wait to see how you celebrate the holidays in the new winter map. Share your Christmas-themed screenshots, adventures, and shenanigans with us using #TalentforDayZ and #ChristmasZ. From all of us on the DayZ team, we hope this event adds warmth and joy to your winter season. Best regards, Lynn",

Halloween event returns for a limited time, running from October 29th to November 12th. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/a5abbd7e4b661e33fec38ff65808a7e991cf474f.jpg October has been a busy month with a primary focus on the release of DayZ Frostline. With priorities shifting, we had limited capacity to expand the Halloween event, so this year’s festivities will be a bit more scaled back. Here’s what you can expect across the maps: Livonia will feature the full Halloween experience, including decayed player characters, spooky zones, demon goats, seasonal infected, and fan-favorite seasonal loot like witch hoods, Day of the Dead eye masks, cauldrons, and more. Sakhal will include select seasonal loot and some Halloween themed infected and animal, but not the full event. This is to preserve a fresh experience for new players exploring the Frostline DLC. Chernarus will not feature Halloween events on official servers, though community servers can freely modify their maps. Feel free to hop between maps to collect seasonal items and check out the infographic below for more details. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/2191b0d7e03386f4f8467e7dc24d3ec2f6d527ce.png We hope this clarifies our plans, and we wish you a fantastic trick-or-treating season! On behalf of the DayZ Team, Lynn ",

We are happy to announce that update 1.26 and DayZ Frostline are now live on all platforms! This article dives into what DayZ Frostline is and what you can expect once you get into the game. DayZ Frostline is all about fighting the cold. But the most important part of it is a third official map called Sakhal. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/03769c70fcc72e5effadf155743472de6c242a4c.png Sakhal is a frozen volcanic archipelago located in the far east. With its windy hill tops, snowy forests, messy settlements, vast ice fields, and a massive naval base, it will certainly test the limits of your survival skills. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/7a7548202edafb45cb99e04244e4a93e55bfb0e1.png The temperature on Sakhal is usually below zero degrees Celsius. Food supplies are scarce and mostly found frozen, forcing players to thaw them out. The landscape’s volcanic nature, meanwhile, poses additional contamination challenges. With food in short supply, many players will resort to hunting. We wanted to make sure this part of the game feels unique, so we’re introducing three new animals to hunt for and two new fish to try and catch. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/8873e105945710b65f09080e3304c916cb7bcf4d.png For those who want a more in-depth look into DayZ Frostline’s development, take a look at our unique series of dev blogs. If you’re interested in buying DayZ Frostline, you can do so on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. While access to servers running Sakhal requires a purchased copy of DayZ Frostline, we’re providing all the assets we built Sakhal with, as well as supporting features and assets, free of charge to anyone in the community for personal use on their servers and maps. We don’t want to hamper our community’s creativity, and look forward to seeing what you come up with. Even if you resist the urge of getting DayZ Frostline, there are a plenty of things changing in the base game. If you’d like to dive deep into what update 1.26 has to offer, then you should definitely check out this article. One thing that isn’t mentioned in the article is the introduction of boats. Yes, you read that right - we are adding small rubber boats to the game! They are the easiest vehicle to get running by far, and can be used to traverse large bodies of water. The boats can be very handy on Sakhal, though they can also be spawned on any map. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/1c2ada143475cb206086685459ae64f4c564a112.png Another big change is your character’s decreased carrying capacity thanks to smaller cargo spaces for jackets, pants, vests, and backpacks. While that may strike some of you as being unpleasant, we listened to the feedback we received during the experimental period and believe this is a healthy change to the game. You’ll have to be a lot more thoughtful while scavenging as it will no longer be as easy to pick everything up. Naturally, this also means that you’ll end up leaving more loot behind for others. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/e35f70ec40fb151c5ea1364ff94f991877933567.png A number of changes were also made to the fishing mechanic, hunting traps, the player’s heat comfort, temperature simulation on items, and more. The in-game server browser saw a lot of upgrades as well, thanks to the addition of better filtering and a new server description field. On top of all this, the official hive experience is changing with the introduction of a regional loot economy. Loot on different maps is divided by climate and regional themes. Sakhal offers warm clothes and mostly eastern gear. Livonia spawns mostly summer clothes and western made gear. Chernarus remains a mixture of both in order to preserve its original feel. Due to these extensive changes, as well as those to cargo space, we decided to wipe the official servers and recommend that community server owners do the same. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/ab4aacb4f04846520993a38030ba5ccdebe14dd5.png Monitoring stability and your feedback will be extra important to us in the coming weeks. Most of our focus will be on player behavior on Sakhal, as well as on the distribution of loot. We received valuable feedback from our streamer event (thanks to everyone for participating!) and are already looking into applying some of that feedback in the upcoming 1.26 patch. These are exciting times for DayZ! We’re very proud of what we’ve achieved, and truly hope that you’ll enjoy all of your new adventures on Sakhal!

        "contents": "⚠️Disclaimer⚠️ Please be aware: Information shared in our development blog represents a work in progress, not the final product. Contents and features discussed are subject to change before release. We aim to provide insight and foster community engagement, but details may evolve as development continues. Thank you for joining us on this journey, with the understanding that what you see here is a glimpse into the process. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/080c4403cef557f3908431064f3dd0831e0c5a45.jpg Hey Survivors! Welcome to our Dev Blog, where we take you behind the scenes of the DayZ Frostline Expansion development. Here, we share the ups and downs of our creative process with you, the community. Your continuous support has always been a lifeline for the game, and we're excited to give you a sneak peek of what DayZ Frostline has in store! Let's talk about Clothing Insulation Variants, New Map Size* and Terrain Builder QoL enhancements! We’ll aim to discuss further and provide clarity on a particularly hot community topic—inventory size changes—in the next dev blog. Insulation Variants As many of you know, DayZ's diverse maps each come with their unique climates and weather conditions. Our goal with DayZ Frostline is to make your survival experience even more immersive and challenging by reflecting these environmental differences through our clothing system. Seasonal Clothing Changes One of the key changes we've implemented is the introduction of seasonal variants for certain types of clothing. For instance: Summer Hunter Gear : In the heat of Livonia, you'll find a Summer Hunter Gear set designed with low insulation to accommodate the summer heat. Perfect for when you’re navigating throug﻿h its dense forests and open fields in warmer temperatures. Winter Hunter Gear : Conversely, on our new winter map, Sakhal, survival against the biting cold is paramount. Thus, you can expect to discover Winter Hunter Gear with high insulation to help you stave off the chill. Sakhal’s unforgiving climate necessitates outfits that provide maximum warmth and protection. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/9e7ec74c91e855172dd7bb822b5f0105603b8fbf.jpg Item Spawning Rates Each map will feature a unique system for spawning these seasonal gears, adhering to a logical rule of thumb: Cold Maps : Higher spaw﻿n rates for warm clothing. Expect to find Winter Gear with greater frequency. Warm Maps : Higher spawn rates for lighter, low-insulation clothing, making your scavenging efforts more fruitful in suitable climates. It's important to remember that while these changes enhance ﻿realism and tactical play, all items remain transferable between maps . So, even if you choose not to purchase the DayZ Frostline Expansion, you can still acquire these seasonal gears through player trades or cross-map transfers. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/8e278b6fd5c7279d65c20bd17fdf4ab7662b835c.jpg M﻿ap Size We initially shared that Sakhal would feature an 83km² traversable terrain, excluding the expansive ice sheets. However, we're pushing the boundaries—quite literally—and it's time to reveal some major enhancements! From 83km² to a Massive 105km² In our early communications, Sakhal was set to be our most compact map yet, focusing on an area of approximately 83km². This decision was inspired by observing player interactions on community-favored modded maps, which showcased a preference for more intimate settings that foster player encounters and engagements. Since then, we've introduced ice sheets to Sakhal's geography. This update significantly expands the landmass, increasing it from the initial 83km² to an impressive 105km². As a result, Sakhal now further surpasses the landmass of the community modded map Namalsk, which measures 27km² without ice sheets and 63km² with them. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/19852064fc2c82ff6ee99a28bd50a79bf9588593.jpg Community Modded map - Creator: Adam Francu - DayZ Creative Lead A Colossal Playable Area With the recent introduction of boats in DayZ, your navigation and exploration capabilities now extend far beyond the confines of land. When factoring in the navigable waters, Sakhal's overall playable area surges to an impressive 236km² . This significant expansion offers you a plethora of new routes to conduct your loot runs, scavenge for essentials, and fight for survival. Despite the increase in size, we've thoughtfully designed key points of interest to maintain high player traffic, ensuring that encounters and engagements remain central to the experience. Fine-Tuned, Immersive Terrain Base building and placements on ice sheets will not be available at the release of DayZ Frostline but will be iterated on in updates following its launch. The newly introduced ice sheets will appear barren and empty, providing an alternative travel route for those wishing to avoid main thoroughfares. Although these vast expanses of ice will support base building and placements in future updates, they will remain devoid of loot to keep players focused on scavenging more high-risk areas and encouraging engagements. We're particularly excited to see how the modding community will expand on this feature, adding further layers of complexity and innovation to the gameplay. (Hint hint: Build Anywhere mod) Even as Sakhal's landmass expands, our commitment to creating an immersive environment remains unwavering. The increased size does not detract from our focus on rich storytelling and intricate details. Our primary goal continues to be delivering the deeply immersive survival experience that DayZ is renowned for. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/9e1b6561595c6c3e3c158b4c9e8ed9b40be68804.jpg Terrain Builder - Improvement for Modding community With the release of DayZ 1.26 alongside the Frostline Expansion, we are excited to introduce a range of quality-of-life impr﻿ovements tailored specifically for the modding community. This update brings enhanced tools and more streamlined workflows, al﻿lowing modders to create custom terrains more efficiently and effectively. What is DayZ Terrain Builder?﻿ DayZ Terrain Builder is a powerful tool designed for the creation of DayZ's virtual worlds﻿. It empower﻿s users to build extensive and immersive landscapes from scratch, offering endless possibilities for creative modders. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/068909f2e4628b19f933da1b34d9270609cce06d.jpg Key Improvements: PNG Generator Speed Boost The PNG generation process for satellite images, satellite normal maps, and surface masks has been significantly optimized﻿. Now, these tasks run approximately three times faster than before. This improvement will greatly enhance your workflow efficiency, allowing you to spend more time on creative aspects rather than waiting for processing. Improved Road Object Handling Moving road objects in Bulldozer used to drastically decrease performance. This issue has been addressed, and the operation now only trig﻿gers when you stop moving the road object. This tweak ensures better performance while editing roads. Additional Enhancements: Library Manager Window Search Bar A new search bar has been added to the Library Manager window. This feature enables users to filter template libraries by typing sear﻿ch terms, making it easier to find specific items. Usable Console for Useful Logs The console window, accessible via Window → Console, now functions properly without freezing Terrain Builder (TB). It provides valuable log information for different actions, helping users troubleshoot and optimize their workflows more effectively. Bug Fixes: Selective PAA Generation The PAA generation tool has been fixed to generate .paa files only for the tiles specified by the user, rather than recreating files for every tile in the layers folder. This targeted approach saves time and resources during the export process.﻿ Layer Operations Refined Renaming object or shape layers now correctly renames the existing files instead of creating new ones. Additionally, deleting layers from the Layers Manager now properly removes the corresponding .tv4l files, cleaning up unnecessary files and reducing clutter. Fixed Clear & Fill Operation The \"Refill (clear & fi﻿ll)\" operation now works as expected, removing existing objects within a shape and generating new ones according to preset names. This functionality ensures that your terrain modifications are accurately reflected. Thank you for joinng us for this weeks Dev Blog. To stay up to date with everything DayZ Frostline related.

Welcome aboard our latest dev blog week 34! Here’s what’s new and noteworthy: Boats! We started prototyping boats late last year, and by the start of this year, the boat was selected for full development. mostly to complement the islandic nature of Sakhal, The initial implementation used in the prototype was stable enough for us to move forward, though we did take some shortcuts, such as leveraging existing simulations such as the car engine and gearbox. Early on, we realized that the complex nature of vehicles, combined with the instability of the pre-existing reconciliation system, could lead to boats bouncing and spinning uncontrollably in the ocean. To address this, we agreed that changes in networking were essential. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/724ef5d3566446c5e4bf99cfaee08582b1fb4596.png Buoyancy is a complex simulation designed for the possible inclusion of more realistic ocean waves in the future. It uses a shape - which the modders will know as the \"Simple Geometry LOD\" - to find the total displaced volume and find the buoyant force and does some additional simulation of drag. Controlling boats in DayZ is intentionally simpler than handling cars. Boats feature three gears: Forward, Neutral, and Reverse. While there are no brakes, you can manage your speed by adjusting the throttle or shifting into reverse to slow down. Boats are primarily designed for one simple b ut vital purpose: transporting players across large bodies of water. They don’t have any inventory space, so you won’t be able to hoard items on them. To get a boat running, you’ll only need a spark plug and some gasoline. If you find a boat on a beach or in shallow water, you can push it into deeper water to start your journey. As demonstrated by @iRoadie_ & @AmishZed {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/bd29d677a82cd2026f092e7011e54fcff9d1722a.jpg Each boat can carry three passengers and one operator, with unique animations for sitting, dying, switching seats, rolling out of the boat even being dragged out. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/937d177b154b2df848981140e6a4274dd1f5b9ee.jpg There's also the consideration of maintenance. While damage doesn’t immediately affect driving performance, it poses a risk as it accelerates the vehicle's progression toward a ruined state. You can repair the boat body by using the tire repair kit. The engine can't be repaired. Once the boat is ruined, it will start to sink slowly, giving you time to get out of the seat. Last but not least, you have the ability to stand on the boat while it moves at a leisurely pace. However, caution is advised, as increasing the boat's speed will result in you falling off. And yes, you will be able to fish from the boat while it’s stationary, so get ready to cast your line and haul in some catches!P.S. We've rolled out an experimental update for 1.26, which includes boats! You can test it out right now on the experimental branches for PC and Xbox. We've already seen some fantastic community reactions to the boats. Check them out below: ROBL (Rolling off the Boat, Laughing) by Happybombs Slexify's Intense Boat Fight Sound Design on Sakhal In our work on environmental sounds for Sakhal, we've added 346 new short ambient sounds that play around the player as 3D audio. These include the sounds of vegetation, metal sounds for new harbor objects, and, of course, birds. We aimed to incorporate bird species specific to the Kamchatka region, but due to limited availability of recordings, we included some birds from other northern areas, like Alaska. These sounds complement the base 2D layers, such as wind, snowfall, and area-specific ambients. We've also introduced 19 new ambient loops that dynamically mix based on factors like area, time, wind, and snowfall. Our goal was to create an environment that feels somewhat alive, even in low temperatures, while also emphasizing the harshness of strong winds. When the wind blows heavily, the contrast becomes apparent as all animal sounds fall silent, heightening the feeling of being overwhelmed by the elements. We control both 2D ambient loops and 3D ambient sounds with the wind factor to achieve this effect. In moments when the player is far from trees or objects where animals might be, and the wind is still, the world can feel almost eerily silent. We're proud to say we've achieved this goal, though we already have a list of improvements we plan to make in the future.

As we enter the experimental period of massive game update 1.26, we also find ourselves on the doorstep of the busiest period we’ve experienced in years. That’s because this game update is coupled with the release of the DayZ Frostline expansion. We highly recommend adding DayZ Frostline to your wishlist if you haven't already. Make sure to check it out on Steam. https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968040/DayZ_Frostline/ You can find the patch notes for 1.26 EXP on our forum here. This is a long read, so please bear with me as I outline all the important things to look for during your experimental playthroughs. Game update 1.26 offers changes and gameplay additions that not only support the DayZ Frostline expansion, but also impact the overall experience of our existing maps Chernarus and Livonia. As the title \"Frostline\" aptly suggests, we have concentrated a lot of work around the temperature systems. That was a challenge in and of itself: ensuring the game systems adapted to a simple change in global temperature. We’ve also rebalanced the way various elements of the environment have an effect on the player character, be it from their position or the current weather. The progression of the player character’s heat comfort is now always delayed, as opposed to instant. This progression may be noticed by one or more arrows at the HUD as the character adapts to the changes in temperature. The heat buffer, also known as the + symbol in UI when you spend enough time around a heat source, is also getting an update to help you visualize its state. This is primarily so it no longer looks like an on and off bonus, which was actually never a thing. Edible items now have their temperatures simulated. They can freeze if the environment temperature is low enough, and will need to be thawed in order to be edible. They can be put on a fireplace grill (or a stove), warmed up, and eaten for warmth benefits. Just make sure to keep an eye on the temperature as the player character can take damage from consuming items that are too hot. In addition to that, we have changed the temperature badge in the tooltip and replaced it with a simple temperature description. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/02e4550a6e5afcabbaec5e70dcb356e759266d0d.png If you want to learn more about these systems, have a look at our recent dev blog post about environmental dangers. Speaking of dangers, we have also looked at the common cold/influenza. We wanted to make sure that players who took care of their characters would not run into too many issues with it, while the ones who continue to ignore it would eventually face the consequences through the newly added stage of pneumonia. Temporal immunity has also been added to the medical system, which makes an instant re-infection impossible for diseases like the common cold. Pain suppression meds (i.e. codeine pills and morphine) have also been expanded and now have the ability to suppress symptoms of both influenza and the common cold. A significant change has also come to large predators like bears and wolves, whose meat will be infected. Most importantly, it won’t be possible to eliminate the infection even after cooking the meat. There is still an option to eat and/or cure the disease, of course, but we wanted to make sure that predators who come to the player naturally are not an easy source of food. Going from Livonia’s fairly warm climate to the unforgiving cold of Sakhal means that you will have to adapt the type of gear you wear (or take frequent baths in local ponds). Luckily, changes to the loot distribution will help you, as items are now distributed with the climate in mind. We’ve also taken a deeper look at the item distribution in Sakhal and applied a kind of regional theme to each map, which will mostly be noticeable through the firearms you’ll find lying around. Livonia will primarily host western-made firearms, Sakhal will mostly host eastern ones, and Chernarus will continue to offer a mixture of both. In terms of spawning, be on the lookout for two new small animals roaming around the wilderness! If you want to spoil the surprise, you can learn more about them at our dev blog here. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/7431b84cb8197a9784293d9f11fda0c63d866144.png A lot of work has also been done around various actions and associated features. One of the highlights is the fishing feature, which has received a long overdue update. We have changed the simple \"hold until you catch a fish\" system into an event-based one, where you have to keep an eye on the water and release the action button when a water splash appears. If you miss this window of opportunity, you’ll have to attach new bait and start fishing again. We’ve also added a new entry-level wooden hook and a fishing jig, which allows you to fish without any bait. Regarding the bait, we’ve removed the crafting recipe and replaced it with a simple inventory attachment process (i.e. dragging a worm on top of the hook). {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/9bee210473c0ea0018f51a51a7d9ab8f0c45e292.png We felt they were quite underused, so a number of changes were made to the hunting traps. We’ve increased the chances of catching an animal, decreased the time it takes to catch one, and made the hunting traps more durable. There is also audio-visual feedback when the trap is triggered. We’ve tweaked force feeding actions because we felt it was way too easy to forcibly feed somebody. Now you actually have to face the player character. Additionally, the camera movement during continuous actions has been restricted, as we didn’t want players to have an easy 360-degree look around. You will also notice that the inventory is now missing a rough and precise indicator. That is not a bug. We have decided to remove the precise and rough skill as we weren't happy with the design, or its implementation (it caused a lot of actions to be desynced). We may revisit the topic of character skills in the future, but no hard promises on that one at this point. A fairly substantial change to the gameplay in 1.26 comes from a large pass over the inventory cargo sizes of most clothing items. We’ve been waiting a long time to revisit this topic because we felt the inventory space of the player character was just too big. This has often resulted in players collecting whatever they find lying around without thinking too much about what they actually need at the given time. This change has impacted most jackets, pants, and vests, as well as several item sizes. Have a look at the following example of a fresh spawn and a geared survivor: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/e22fe2d8f9389ee2c7972dc8bb1825b931077086.png You’re probably wondering, “Where am I supposed to store all the repair kits?!” Well, we’ve also reduced the damage that clothes take from infected hits. Apart from the gameplay additions and changes, we have also taken a deeper look at our server browser. Namely, we re-designed the server details section and added it to the console version. This also includes the addition of a server description field, where server owners can describe what their server is about. A new map column and filters were also added ahead of the introduction of a third official map. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/ab244a256eb6bd6264b8aeb569b7f9adb8d36efb.png Another thing we were finally able to implement is the official server verification system, which ensures that only official servers will be displayed in the official tab on our Steam build. This will put an end to all kinds of shady servers, which tend to confuse players who want to play on official servers. Understanding the server names plays a big part in finding a place where you want to spend your time. That’s why we revisited the official server naming convention. We wanted to make sure the servers are easier to read and still offer the most relevant information. You can see a preview in the picture above. When it comes to UI, PC players will be able to spot two new graphical settings - terrain and object visibility. We realized how much scenery would open up (especially with Sakhal coming), if we made these options available. These settings are client-side and independent from network bubble settings. Increasing them won’t give players any serious tactical advantage over others (i.e. you can’t see players/vehicles further away). Maximum values can also be limited by server owners, should they desire to do so. If you’re interested in learning more about this topic, check out our earlier dev blog. The blog also details the new ways that fog can be controlled dynamically. This feature can be utilized in Sakhal, as well as in Chernarus and Livonia, where we used it to implement occasional morning fog that settles in the valleys. We hope it’ll increase your sense of immersion, as well as make the environment more visually varied and interesting as you play. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/944158f509afb6601c270dff9675f0664283f0d5.png We’re sure our creative modding community will appreciate the expanded weather script API, as well as the increased vertex limit on a single model (previously 32 thousand, now 65 thousand vertices). This has already been a massive post, and I haven’t even mentioned all the new content that’s available in update 1.26. I hope you’ll enjoy discovering the rest on your own. I also hope you’ll join this experimental update. Have fun and share your feedback. Help us test the stability of one of the most important updates DayZ has had in years. On behalf of the DayZ team, Adam",

The contents and features discussed are subject to change before release. We aim to provide insight and foster community engagement, but details may evolve as development continues. Thank you for joining us on this journey, and for understanding that what you see here is a glimpse into the process. Dear Survivors, With the Frostline Expansion release on the horizon, we want to give the community a behind-the-scenes look at our development process. We've been regularly publishing Dev Blogs on our forums, and you can check them out here. This progress report serves as a summary of those Dev Blogs, and offers an extra layer of insight into our creative works, processes, and achievements. 1.26 Changes you can look forward to Before we get into the Frostline Expansion, we'd like to start with a few changes that will also impact the base game with update 1.26. Even though we're concentrating on releasing a paid DLC, that doesn't mean we aren’t implementing any changes or improvements to the base game with 1.26. Our efforts on Frostline are for the betterment of DayZ as a whole. Notably, the view distance in the game has been substantially increased, and you'll have full control over it via the settings on the client side. We’ve also made significant efforts for us and community server owners to have more control over weather elements like wind and fog. The current fog system is tied to distance fog value and overcast, and is defined by the config, which evidently is limiting. With update 1.26, the dev team, modders, and server owners will have full dynamic control over the fog through a new script API. The fog will also affect the visibility of the sky, which is perfect for those who wish to create areas that have less visibility and a gloomier atmosphere. More control over weather means more capabilities for us to create dynamic weather patterns and changes. Wind is one element we will have more control over. It will be a definitive factor in providing visual hints via the direction of snowfall, rain, or the direction and intensity of trees being affected by the wind. While the change in weather won’t be predetermined or occur in patterns players can predict, those who observe their surroundings and anticipate environmental challenges will have a strategic advantage. Think of the blizzards of Sakhal and the thunderstorms of Livonia. Snow in Frostline One of the map’s main features is the snow and its integration into the environment. The snowfall particles are newly created / added to the terrain, and have been significantly improved since the last time you saw them in the official teaser. As you can see in the example below, these particles are not just white dots, but nuanced, weighted elements that enhance immersion and are even affected by light. Moreover, the snow on the ground will gradually thaw when a fireplace is placed upon it. Cars driving over the snow, meanwhile, will leave behind distinctive tire tracks. Thanks to the Enfusion team, we have updated super, multi, and plant shaders to allow texture projection in any defined direction. This is particularly beneficial for rocks and trees, as they no longer need to be placed or textured in a specific way. Snow will always be projected from top to bottom, ensuring a more realistic appearance. This is especially beneficial for the modding community. Visuals of Frostline Following our successful upgrade of skyboxes for existing terrains in update 1.23, we're now focusing on creating a unique skybox tailored to Sakhal, which will enhance the map's snowy environment. This new skybox goes beyond mere compatibility; we're confident it will enrich Sakhal's atmosphere with a blend of Cirrus and Alto/Cirrocumulus clouds. Inspired by the Kamchatkan region, we conducted extensive research and utilized Google Street View for visual documentation. Additionally, we captured our own collection of winter sky photographs just outside our office, ensuring an authentic backdrop that fully immerses you in the cold, snowy world of Frostline. Despite Sakhal being our smallest map at 83 square kilometers, we're enhancing its visual distinctiveness by introducing new objects such as roads, fences, power lines, and a variety of points of interest. Our primary goal is to ensure that every location you visit during your travels feels unique compared to other maps. Working with essentially a blank canvas has allowed us to push the boundaries of environmental design in ways that depart from the constraints of existing maps (which had to be more consistent in general). This will ensure creative freedom and a more immersive experience. To achieve this diversity and uniqueness for Sakhal's points of interest, we've incorporated over 400 Sakhal-specific objects. These include reworked existing assets with new variants, assets ported from Arma titles (such as Arma 3 and Arma Reforger), and entirely new and unique assets created specifically for Sakhal. Here are a few examples of new residential buildings. You may have already known that we are retexturing most of the houses to fit the region. We are also reworking a substantial number of house interiors, along with adding several intriguing hiding spots. Our goal is to imbue the houses with a sense of dilapidation and occupancy, and present interiors and decorations that have more character and history compared to previous iterations found in Livonia and Chernarus. You can see some of the house tour below. Stay up to date with us! We aim to provide more platform-specific rundowns every few months or so. We also publish Dev Blogs on our forum every couple of weeks. Additionally, you can follow us Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. These blog posts are meant to share our passion and document our creative journey, including the challenges and triumphs we experience along the way. As always, we owe everything to the DayZ community, whose steadfast support and creativity have been essential not just for the game's survival, but for our shared journey toward thriving. If you liked what you’ve seen so far, make sure you hit the wishlist button, because Frostline is set to drop by the end of the fall. https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968040/DayZ_Frostline/",

While our team is working diligently on the Frostline expansion (which will deliver a winter experience to DayZ later this autumn), we wanted to give you something to celebrate at the beginning of summer. Character cosmetics and seasonal events have been major focuses in our recent updates, and this summer event is no exception. A massive shoutout to our friends at Starbreeze Studio and the Payday team for allowing us to feature legendary masks from Payday (Dallas, Houston, and Wolf), as well as Chains, which is making its DayZ debut. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/821b91855b45d47ddc8960b4324b36e86bba3d6b.png Veteran DayZ players will fondly remember when these masks were synonymous with banditry. Due to the visual progress DayZ has made over the years, and the masks provided by the Payday team, we’ve fully reworked them with brand new textures to fit our current aesthetic. The masks will be distributed across both maps, with two types on each map. You'll need to travel between the maps or obtain them from an unlucky server hopper. The iconic star-spangled mask of Dallas, along with the masks of the original Payday crew, are returning to DayZ for a limited time on the 4th of July. The event will run until July 23rd across all platforms, and community server owners will have access to the event files even after the event is over. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/742e9f0f5e7159048456f05888840b99832a4047.png So rally your squad, then suit up, mask up, and score some sweet loot!

        "contents": "Greetings, Survivors! Time is flying for us this year and there’s tons that’s going on. Earlier this month, we announced our next big milestone: an expansion called DayZ Frostline. Today, we’re happy to announce that game update 1.25 has arrived on Steam! Today also marks the start of a new era for Livonia. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/50f1171335be0e0da8f5394b9155e3a5fbf9cf10.png All current owners of the base game will get the DLC for free. Meanwhile, the Livonia DLC will be included with the base game from this point forward and available to all at a slightly increased price. If you’re itching to explore new places while you’re waiting for Sakhal, there’s never been a better time! OK, back to update 1.25. What can you expect when you jump into the game? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/03a66b9e20a2a186cb38946dd11b1da1cc5489b5.png The highlight of the update is definitely the long awaited addition of ambient music. We worked with Czech composer Dikolson to create a subtle and ambient background that increases your immersion as you walk through different areas of the game at various times of the day. There’s approximately 70 minutes of music available at the moment, with more to come in the future. We love the music so much, that we published a selection of it on Steam. If you’re interested in listening to this wonderful music outside of DayZ, you can find it on the Steam store page or within your Steam library under Soundtracks. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/4ea0440138efeccc4b3a598bbf294b168c914ba5.png Note: Can take 24 hours for soundtrack to show in Library Ambient tracks aren’t the only addition to the game’s audio. Update 1.25 also delivers the first rework of firearm sounds, including updated sounds of shotguns, the crossbow, and the grenade launcher. Our audio team has also been busy rebalancing the distance where you can still hear a player’s actions (previously, the audibility of all actions was set at 50 meters). To prevent items disappearing from the inventory after using quick slots / certain actions, we decided to limit the use of contents in nested containers like cooking pots and protector cases through quick slots. We also reworked the way a player character’s position is synchronized with the server in order to tackle issues such as getting stuck in a doorway. Another addition in update 1.25 is a new long-range bolt-action firearm, the VS-89 with a 10-round magazine. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/9f808522d11f49402149d5db96019e4b4f298e53.png We’d like to highlight the fact that we’ve integrated the Enfusion crash reporter. We’d appreciate it if you’d take the time to fill in the details before sending us the full report. That’s it for update 1.25. Our next step is update 1.26, which will be released together with DayZ Frostline later this year. Make sure to keep your eyes on our forums and socials, where more information regarding DayZ Frostline will be revealed.

We hope that your anticipation is high for this fall's release, and you can now wishlist Frostline on Steam. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/79b53873e3e6c40f8f0a81c8580205a8d2dc8e0d.png The centerpiece of the expansion is the Sakhal terrain, inviting you to explore its rugged and desolate reaches. Unlike previous locations, you'll play as a survivor seeking refuge in the rumored safe haven of Sakhal, only to face an unforgiving environment frozen both in time and climate. Despite its brutality, Sakhal promises beauty at every perilous turn, with frozen lakes, snow-draped forests, and frosty peaks. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/7c95f41f5758d70c47b172e4da6af9d3c43bd8e6.png The proximity to volcanic regions amplifies the hazards, doubling the threats you'll face. Although the terrain may be more compact compared to previous ones, each new challenge in the expansion will deliberately decelerate your progress, compelling you to recalibrate your playstyles. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/5fe50249de35d1e7ef22e17c37fa32f5a2615618.png To survive, you'll need to adapt like the new region-specific wildlife species acclimated to the cold, equipping winter-themed cosmetics to brave the elements and uncover Sakhal's intriguing structures and points of interest. Preparation is key to survival, and as the frost sets in, only those with ice in their veins and fire in their hearts will endure. DayZ Frostline is coming, heralding a chilling new chapter in the ultimate fight for survival. We hope to see you on the island, Adam, Lynn, and the DayZ Team",

Originally an Arma 2 mod before it made the jump to Steam in 2018, we're still seeing over 50,000 people play it at any given time. If you've played any sort of survival game about crafting, gathering resources, finding weapons, and contending with other players, DayZ was one of the pioneers of the genre. Now, as we approach update 1.25, Bohemia Interactive says it'll be folding the Livonia DLC into the base game, and current owners will get the expansion for free. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/steam-price-change\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-zombie-games\">The best zombie games on PC 2024</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/best-servers\">The best DayZ servers 2024</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-day-before/sale-steam\">DayZ dev trolls The Day Before with big new survival game Steam sale</a> ",

Before we get to that, however, we’d like to announce a significant change. DayZ's base game, along with the Livonia DLC, will merge into a single product once update 1.25 is released on stable branches. The goal is to streamline our portfolio and simplify our offerings in anticipation of future developments. Simultaneously, we aim to elevate the player experience by enhancing accessibility to Livonia, thereby integrating the communities of both the base game and the DLC across every platform. While there will be a modest increase in price due to the new product’s expanded value, the pricing will be more economical than the current DayZ Livonia Bundle. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/b43d0506554759605da0810cb9727529b5951946.png To clarify: the Livonia DLC will no longer be sold separately once update 1.25 is released on stable branches. Existing DayZ base game owners without Livonia will receive the DLC free of charge as a token of our appreciation. A comprehensive press release and FAQ detailing these changes will be issued on May 20th. Stay tuned for more details! Now, let’s dive into what you should be keeping your eyes and ears on while trying out the experimental version of update 1.25. The highlight of this update is definitely the introduction of ambient music. We’re thrilled that we were able to make this long-requested feature a reality, thanks to our cooperation with Czech composer Filip Míšek. The update features around 100 minutes of music, which plays during different times of day, as well as when you travel through various locations. We hope you’ll enjoy the music and become more immersed in your adventures. Keep in mind that the ambient music won’t be available until the second experimental build due to scheduling reasons. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/12770a7824afb7854c9b295e639020776ec7cbd1.png Our audio team has also reworked the firearm sounds for all shotguns, as well as the sounds for the grenade launcher and crossbow. Additionally, the team has been very busy rebalancing the distance where you can still hear a player’s actions (previously, the audibility of all actions was set at 50 meters). This change doesn’t cover weapons or footsteps yet, but that is also on the team’s radar for the future. Another thing we’ve improved is the way a player’s position is corrected between the client and the server. This only affects the character you’re playing and should prevent issues like getting stuck in a doorway. We’ve also addressed an inventory inconsistency that was causing items in nested cargo containers to be moved around or even dropped without any notice. This has been happening since update 1.23, and forced us to limit the manipulation in such a way that you will no longer be able to assign items that are stored inside a nested cargo container to quick slots. Some of the things affected by this change include cooking pots and protector cases, as well as special actions like firearm reloads. Ammo and magazines that are stored in nested cargo containers will be ignored by the reload action. Last but not least, we are introducing an automated game client and server crash collection system in DayZ. This will help us finally get a better idea about the overall stability of our game (particularly on PC). If you receive a prompt after your game has crashed, please provide details explaining what happened, then click “Send”. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/c07df57ca07cf3851a894de2cc1244d8da1a0c59.png As usual, you can check the full list of changes and additions over at our forum. Some of you may be wondering whether there’s anything more to this update. Well, there isn't. This is mostly due to the fact that update 1.25 was built on top of 1.24. That’s because we are currently extremely busy with a very important milestone which is slated for delivery later this year. We are super excited to tell you more about it soon! On behalf of the DayZ team, Adam",

Staying true to our commitment in supporting in-game events this year, we're happy to announce the return of the annual Walpurgis event. While seasoned veterans are likely well acquainted with this event, newcomers to the game may benefit from a quick overview. The Night of the Witches (known as Čarodejnice in Czech) is a celebration spanning April 30th and May 1st. Originating from ancient pagan rites, Walpurgis Night originally symbolized the renewal of nature with the onset of spring. Over time, it evolved into a Christianized festival honoring Saint Walpurga, renowned for her protection against supernatural forces, including witchcraft. In modern times, bonfires illuminate the night skies in some parts of Germany as people joyously dance around Maypoles, while Finland and Sweden embrace the outdoors with picnics and lively gatherings. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/b6340c00f1567ac5afee6d2dea6564909ae74ffd.png Echoing its real-world counterpart, the DayZ Walpurgis Night event promises an atmospheric experience, with bonfires being lit up across the maps. These fiery beacons may serve as both sanctuaries, offering warmth and respite, or potential traps, leaving you exposed to the watchful eyes of other unfriendly survivors. Following the elaborate mechanics of previous events like the healing bolts during Valentine's, we've opted to keep this simple. Here's the list of items you can find at the bonfires: Cauldron Witch Hat Witch Hood Birch Broom Crooked Nose The infected witch and the infected firefighters So, arm yourself once more with pitchforks, fire-spewing brooms, and the iconic witch hoods as you venture into both Chernarus and Livonia. The event will start on the 16th of April and end on the 5th of May across all platforms and official servers. Stay warm, survivors. Best regards, Lynn ",

Similar to other updates we’ve released early in the year, this one features a thorough tidying up. Basically, we went through a bunch of pending tasks for quality-of-life improvements and addressed an array of outstanding issues. While it may be rather humble in nature, update 1.24 will serve as a solid foundation to build upon and lead us to our major update which will be featured in the autumn. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/e3d8c824cbe30c592eb4d6de067ff1f19cff51f5.jpg Those who were involved in the update’s experimental phase will already be familiar with our brand new Vikhr rifle, which features a new 30 round 9x39mm magazine that’s compatible with all 9x39mm rifles. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/f0c78cc1d24cbb0bdea9b98fd14e4d5234b1c0ce.jpg In addition to the new rifle and magazine, update 1.24 also offers new camouflage variants of the ballistic helmet. These will help enrich the variety of your player character, and protect your head during the exciting journey DayZ will embark on this year. Here are some more notable improvements we're particularly fond of: Smoother weapon handling when you make contact with obstacles Increased damage output of blunt melee weapons against infected and animals Optimized gun particle effects for better client performance Refined collision geometry of foliage that improves performance and overall fluidity of movement (both player and vehicle) Rebalanced recoil patterns for automatic rifles Official release of the Linux version for the DayZ server slated for the stable branch To get the complete scope of everything available in update 1.24—including an array of new sounds and animations—we encourage you to drop by our official forums and peruse the comprehensive update notes available here. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/979f9e085ff89a11457301bdb86e971271fd5175.jpg DayZ in 2024 While we're thrilled to start the year with update 1.24, we're equally eager to offer you a glimpse into what we have planned for the remainder of 2024.

As we indicated last year (DayZ in 2023 & DayZ 10 Year Anniversary Q&A), our focus has been on expanding the scope of the DayZ brand. Significant resources have been allocated to this endeavor, and we’re poised to showcase the initial outcomes later on this year – it's a colossal milestone and an exhilarating moment you won't want to miss! We’re still working out all the details, but I am pleased to share our strategic areas of focus for 2024. One of the things we’ll be continuing is our dedication to new character cosmetics which are a core aspect of the DayZ experience. We’re also planning to unveil a rather exotic long-range rifle. Our recently reinforced audio team has already begun the major task of reworking the sounds of firearms. Other parts of the game’s audio are also being concentrated on, including the addition of new action sounds, coupled with a substantial balancing of the audio that’s tied to player actions. Another audio angle we’re committed to is the introduction of nuanced ambient music, which will increase the game environment’s depth and tension. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/80d7bd5b187e8858def5b39d1123ad6a6e2a9803.jpg Other areas of focus include introducing a richer variety of wildlife, improving our terrain tools (Terrain Builder primarily) to make the lives of our modding community easier, and elevating survival mechanics—from extreme conditions to medical challenges—that will test your mettle and encourage players to adapt their survival strategies and manage their nutrition through an extended variety of sustenance options. As you can see, we are fully committed to delivering a fresh and challenging survival experience to DayZ. Stay tuned for more info! Events As of this writing, we bid a fond farewell to our Valentine’s event, which introduced Cupid’s bolts to the Experimental release and was available via community servers. Don’t worry if you missed out, though, because this year will include our usual special occasions like the Walpurgis Event, the Halloween event, and Christmas celebrations—all of which will be carefully designed to enhance your gaming experience. We’re also looking into the possibility of hosting new events in collaboration with other games. Legacy DayZ players may have an idea of what we’re talking about. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/f82c7c25dcf75b1aa71ce751ba4c6ce18293efa7.jpg That concludes DayZ in 2024. We’re enthusiastically anticipating a year filled with remarkable journeys, and we sincerely hope that you will join us in experiencing the continued evolution of DayZ. On behalf of the DayZ team, Scotty ",

        "contents": "Greetings, Survivors! We’re excited to announce that Experimental game update 1.24 is now available on experimental branches on Steam! As with most updates early in the year, this one includes a clean sweep. Basically, we went through our backlog and tackled a variety of lingering issues. Let’s go through some of the major ones, so you know what to focus on while you’re enjoying the experimental branch. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/396266ab3cf4069279ed8935c27923a73e6c996e.jpg It’s pretty much tradition at this point that our awesome community breaks DayZ’s record for highest player count every new year! It was definitely a confidence boost this time around, as we face a number of challenges in this year’s plan—by far the most ambitious we’ve had since the engine switch in 2018. But it’s far too soon to talk about such things here. Instead, this post is dedicated to the year’s first experimental release: game update 1.24! As with most updates early in the year, this one includes a clean sweep. Basically, we went through our backlog and tackled a variety of lingering issues. Let’s go through some of the major ones, so you know what to focus on while you’re enjoying the experimental branch. The collision geometries of vegetation (particularly trees and bushes) received a substantial polishing pass. Our aim was to simplify and fix issues which were causing odd collisions with vehicles. There were also performance problems with too many particles, which occurred whenever a bullet pierced through branches. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/382451a69e0649afdd465eeb0eb3dc3e00d99a25.png Speaking of particles, we took a look at firearm particles and optimized them for smoother gunplay. We also increased the recoil slightly in several automatic firearms. Furthermore, we unified our approach to randomly loaded firearms that spawn in the world. This change now makes it impossible to recognize whether a firearm was dropped by a player or spawned in recently. We dramatically improved the way weapon lifting behaves, making it smoother and more precise now. We also improved the way weapon lengths are calculated. We hope these changes will make close-quarter combat with firearms less frustrating overall. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/4153b37151c7b322caf8b142c03bb994fcc235b6.jpg Unfortunately, we had to postpone making more complex changes to the infected AI, though we still found time to investigate some of the issues. As a result, we significantly reduced the noise from the impact of bullets. This means the infected won’t be so easily drawn to the impact from fired bullets (particularly helpful when suppressed firearms are used). We also increased the damage output of blunt melee weapons and tools against the infected and animal AI. This was done by adding a portion of their shock damage into the total damage dealt. Moving on, a noteworthy improvement was also made to bandaging. If your character has multiple bleed sources, and your bandage stack has enough uses, you can now continuously bandage without any interruptions. If you’d like to dive deeper into experimental update 1.24, you can find the change notes on our forums. Fair warning—the change notes also mention a few fun things that are included in this update. So, if you’d rather not spoil the surprise, join us on the experimental servers before you do any more reading! As usual, please report any issues you may encounter to our feedback tracker. Thank you!

They can be found in the center of town in both Chernarus and Livonia. Gift boxes will spawn around the trees and serve as hotspots with high engagement rates. The boxes will offer loot from various tiers and double as reusable wrapping paper, so you can embrace the spirit of giving by sharing the joy with fellow survivors. Infected Santa and his sleigh will be crashing into forests and rooftops. Please note that they won't be replacing normal dynamic helicopter crashes, though they will spawn loot in gift boxes that’re just as good. Keep an eye out around the wreckage for Rudolph and his friends. We hope they’ll stick the premature landing. In addition to classic seasonal items like Santa’s beard and hat, we're also introducing new assets to help you embrace the holiday spirit: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/58be410881cc18b63cabad9177145eb9b432f3fe.jpg Christmas-themed woolen gloves (including the fingerless version) A variety of Christmas-themed headbands A selection of consumable candy canes with new custom animations ​​​​​​​The Morozko Hat (inspired by Ded Moroz, the Slavic version of St. Nick) But wait, there’s more! We mentioned briefly that it’s DayZ’s 10th anniversary. That’s why we left a few surprises in the game for you to find (yes, that includes the 10-year anniversary shirt). If you discover what the surprises are, we hope you’ll share your findings via screenshots, videos, etc. so everyone can enjoy.",

        "contents": "Greetings, Survivors! Update 1.23 is now live on Steam! We’ve brought highly anticipated changes to Vybor Air Base on Chernarus (commonly known as NWAF), the sky has gotten a massive visual upgrade, and spawning into the game has changed. Check out our change notes (Steam, Consoles) for all the details, or keep on reading for an overall summary of what you can expect. One of the update’s most exciting changes is the way the day and night skies look. Clouds are generally a lot more defined now, and the transition between day and night is smoother than ever before. We even developed a custom sky setup for Chernarus and Livonia so now they feel different from each other. We truly hope these changes will help make you feel more immersed in the environment. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/4e376724111af6a31c48d69be74fc50cea447170.jpg Prepare for a thrilling transformation at Vybor Air Base in Chernarus, fondly known as NWAF. Our latest update brings you exciting changes, featuring brand-new Points of Interest (POIs). The revamped layout not only pays homage to the legacy iteration of this iconic airfield but also introduces something fresh to the table. With the land expertly flattened and an intensified sense of paranoia, we've restored the high-risk, high-reward atmosphere that awaits you at this renowned location. We’ve also introduced new assets into the game. Those who remember the old Arma 2 DayZ Mod may recognize the legendary firearm - the DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle). This iconic semi-automatic firearm (based on the legendary M14), is used by the US marine corps, shoots .308, can attach most western sights, and loads 10 or 20-round magazines. It’s definitely a must have if you’re looking for a powerful mid-range firearm! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/9ba151ddd6132e498f0a90841a69588c8a9c3934.jpg For those of you who like to keep your valuables in stashes, say hello to the field shovel. It’s a compact tool that can do most of what the adult shovel does. There are also a bunch of character-related clothing items for your head, as well as new gloves. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/939a4a2b175328eefe9fe729758812158a0f7825.jpg We’ve also attempted to bring new players closer together with the introduction of player spawn groups. This mechanic switches between different spawn points around the map during the server’s runtime. That means you can start or respawn on a server at the same time as your friends and you'll have a very good chance of spawning in the same area. This makes it easier to meet up when you're just getting started! Remember: finding a friend in the starting areas is always easier than bumping into them when you’re fully geared! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/060bb6ec805ceef85f908c43095019cb7460e61f.jpg But wait, there’s more! You are now able to unstick your vehicle using the new push action Queue states and the time of day are now visible in the server browser Building bases in the Livonia underground is no longer possible We rebalanced the distribution of high-tier firearms within and outside of Chernarus’ and Livonia’s contaminated areas We introduced a way to adjust a player’s startup gear through the server-side mission files (particularly important for console community servers) If you think there isn’t much to look forward to in DayZ before the end of the year, just you wait and see! We’ve got DayZ’s 10th anniversary celebration coming up, as well as our annual Christmas event. And don't forget to look up! As a friendly reminder, we’d like to emphasize our Wipe Announcement. Due to recent modifications on both DayZ terrains, we will be performing a wipe on both maps. Rest assured, your characters are safe, and any loot carried by your characters will not be affected by the wipe. On behalf of the DayZ team, Adam ",

We have set the duration from 17th of October the 7th of November. During this time, we're not just reintroducing seasonal assets and scenery changes but adding some exciting twists. Let's briefly discuss them. The beloved spooky zones are back, so make sure you're dressed warmly with good insulation, as the temperature can significantly drop, casting an eerie blue tint over your surroundings. Keep your senses sharp, for these spooky areas are now haunted by the lingering spirits of the departed. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/9614b3d21c750f4fde7a6109e0be532d60f8833b.jpg The seasonal infected types, from the pumpkin-infected to the formidable mummy variants, will be spawning in spooky zones and cemeteries, respectively. Of course, we're also bringing back other seasonal infected types to align with the thematic essence. Also, keep an eye out for tribes of goats, as one of them will exhibit a certain demonic presence in these grim settings. We are “officially” debuting some seasonal cosmetic additions we have added into the game over the past few updates. Notably, the Hooded Chainmail Coif and Eye Masks (Day of the Dead variant) will be scattered throughout the maps, alongside other Halloween-themed cometic items. It's not just about gears and assets; your character will have a certain spooky appearance, perfect for trick-or-treating with other survivors in every scenario. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/a3ea2d1a7d4bc4751cf024f8ae5c52f9fe59994a.jpg If you happen to capture eerie screenshots or create video content of your trick-or-treating adventures, please send them our way!

We're thrilled to announce that the experimental phase for the much-awaited game update 1.23 has begun. For those on Steam, dive right in and experience all the enhancements we've made. From major additions like player spawn groups to quality of life improvements in the server browser, this update promises an enriched gameplay experience. Check out the full change notes on our forums, and join us in shaping the future of DayZ. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/71fccbf1e3900a8040d96618059610d0614f2b6a.jpg One of the major additions in this update are player spawn groups. We’ve updated the player spawn system in such a way that it now cycles between pre-defined sets of positions during a server’s runtime. Our primary goal is to keep fresh players closer together and to increase the chances of interactions. Finding good values for this new system may take a bit of time, so please let us know what your experience is like. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/a80d7580f044881cf05eae7fb37b5883ddbed72e.jpg Speaking of player spawns, we’re also introducing the ability to adjust player spawn gear through a dedicated mission file. Documentation for both of these features will be coming to the official wiki during the experimental period. We made a number of tweaks to driving the M3S truck and M1025 off-road, which should help players while driving uphill and during general off-road conditions. In addition to this, we’ve also introduced a push vehicle action, which should help get vehicles unstuck from various light crashes with the environment. We’ve also continued efforts to increase your immersion by adding more custom sounds to actions within the game. You can find a list of them in the change notes. Keep in mind that this is a massive undertaking, but we are slowly getting to them all. The server browser has received quality of life improvements again, this time with the introduction of the number of players (if any) in the queue, as well as displaying the time on each server (previously missing in the console server browser). We’ve also decided to disable the placing of base building objects in the underground areas, though server owners can re-enable it through the server-side settings. The long awaited overhaul of the Vybor Air Base (commonly known as NWAF) on Chernarus has arrived, alongside many supporting assets. We hope these changes will improve your experience within the area by making the looting less tedious and interactions more fun overall. Speaking of looting, we made some adjustments to the distribution of higher tier weapons in both Chernarus and Livonia. While you’re (probably) shooting at each other at the updated airfield, please keep an eye out for any character movement desyncs on your targets while shooting between trees, as we’ve been working on some low-level fixes to tackle desyncs during those situations. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/1a020e745a89a9293d81315759e168a9a4a4b51e.jpg We’ve added a lot of cosmetic items (primarily for your player’s head), and the field shovel has made a comeback. There’s also a brand new rifle, which may look familiar to those of you who used to play the old Arma 2 mod. Finally, you may want to look up this time around, as things should feel very different! As usual, please report any issues you may encounter to our feedback tracker. Thank you! DayZ Dev Team ",

As usual, you can find the full list on our official forums The biggest highlight of this update is the addition of new low tier bags, as well as a major rebalance pass of existing backpacks. We’ve always felt that the early game was lacking in variety, and we’ve tried to fill that gap with this update. Additionally, bigger backpacks are now more rare than before. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/cf77c368ffb129da987866fb5c013b7726a3dcda.jpg Melee combat received a number of balancing changes. This includes a reworking of how bleeding is applied (i.e. respecting the values of individual clothes you wear), and a rebalancing of damage and protection values. Basically, we tried to establish a greater difference between what is considered a tool and a weapon. You can read more about these changes in our experimental blog post. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/f41f50eb82cad1517cb0615c69afae959bca2647.jpg We also made several improvements to the server browser. The most obvious one is that the game and PC launcher now display the absolute number of players on a server. The PC launcher server browser also received several quality of life improvements to the direct connect window, as well as to tab switching, which now makes searching in different tabs a lot faster. Speaking of connecting to servers: have you ever had a problem with waiting in the queue, only to find that your mod files are outdated or corrupted? Well, that won’t happen anymore with update 1.22 because we’ve implemented changes to the login procedure. Now it processes the data integrity check right at the beginning. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/ced2924ba24b69034b01fb49a50c08b56971c628.png Last, but certainly not least, we are also hard at work on our upcoming Halloween event.

We’ve got a lot of new bugs bags and backpacks – coming in this update. We won’t dive deep into what they are or how they look, but let’s just say that our focus was on increasing the variety in lower tiers. That’s because we felt there weren’t enough options, and it was fairly easy to obtain a high-capacity backpack early on in the game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/188385ea6e5b32a423f8339343399f650b8262c2.jpg Next on the menu is a major balancing pass on melee combat. We introduced the mace and sword in update 1.21 and observed that it was fairly difficult to balance how these weapons behaved against each other. As a result, we did some balancing on both the attacking and defending side of things, and tried to do a better job distinguishing between tools and weapons in their stats (i.e. a tool is not necessarily made for combat, unlike an actual weapon). Additionally, clothing items with meaningful protection should actually provide much better protection now to those who wear them. The chances of bleeding were reworked as well, and we also fixed the issue regarding infected bleed attacks ignoring protection. This should greatly improve your odds of surviving a fight with the infected, particularly when wearing an item like chainmail. Furthermore, we removed the ability to stun opponents with certain light items. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/f41f50eb82cad1517cb0615c69afae959bca2647.jpg Players on Steam will be happy to hear that the launcher server browser has received a number of improvements, such as: All tabs are now automatically refreshed at the start of the launcher and queries are not restarted whenever a tab is switched. A direct connect window now allows you to connect to a modded server and offers the option to add the server to your favorites. The player count is no longer obfuscated and the actual number of players on a server is displayed instead. The change in displaying the player count is also reflected in the in-game server browsers, which means console players will also be able to benefit from this improvement. We made a lot of changes “under the hood” and would love to know if you have any issues with the following during your experimental testing: Joining a modded server with the queue in place. We changed the data verification process so that players with incorrect data get kicked out the moment they enter the queue, instead of getting kicked out after going through the queue. The hit registration. We made some improvements and would like to know if you experience any issues hitting targets in the mid to long ranges. The mouse cursor while in the window / full screen. We’re trying to resolve some issues with the mouse cursor being stuck during certain conditions. The AI navigating the environment, and doors in particular. We fixed a lot of bugs on the navmesh side of things. Player collisions with the bodies of bigger dead animals to prevent players from hiding inside them. As usual, please report any issues you may encounter to our feedback tracker.

Whether you're looking for some intense PvP, a relaxed PvE sandbox, or even a place to roleplay like DayZ Underground, where a creative community has lived out years' worth of stories, creating authentic in-universe lore. We'll also talk about what awaits you on the official servers. Dean Hall, perhaps the leading figure in the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival game</a> sandbox revolution of the early 2010s, first created the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-zombie-games\">zombie game</a> as a mod within ARMA 2, then joined Bohemia Interactive to work on a standalone release. While Hall has since moved on, Bohemia has continued to update the game, and it has come a long way from its first form as a zombie-survival sim. Dozens of additional systems have <em>almost</em> turned it into a life sim, and endless mod-ability means that if you can't do something in the vanilla release, you can probably do it on a modded server somewhere. Read on for our list of some of the best and most populated official and community servers, and a breakdown of exactly what they offer to the discerning <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz\">DayZ</a> player. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/best-servers\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/steam-player-count\">Legendary survival game DayZ hits new highs following second expansion launch</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/frostline-dlc-out-now-steam\">After 11 years, DayZ is suddenly harder and more brutal than ever before</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/steam-sale-price-increase\">Steam's biggest zombie survival game has final sale before price hike</a> ",

        "contents": "Greetings, survivors! DayZ update 1.21 has just been released on all platforms! We’ve got something unique for you this time around because we’re traveling back to medieval times! What does that mean exactly? Let’s dive right in and find out. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/bfbb300cb15cd7fb79fd8da87c35c821f4600e57.jpg We’re introducing the crossbow in this update, which happens to be DayZ’s first ever spring-powered weapon. The crossbow is a ranged weapon that can shoot deadly bolts and fit a variety of sights and scopes. The bolts are recoverable, though they will suffer a loss in durability every time they hit their target. In case you can’t find your bolt after you’ve shot it, you can always create improvised ones to replenish your supply. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/d27c65b32335310b8f04006d60ced3ef352d994b.jpg While the crossbow may not be strictly medieval, we’ve scattered an assortment of replicated items and clothing throughout the world that are medieval in theme. We don’t want to spoil the fun by going into specifics, but let’s just say there’s enough variety to equip a survivor knight who’s ready to lay siege on a castle base. In other update news, fans and winners of last year’s Lights Out event will be happy to learn that the winning flags have made it into the game and can now be found in Livonia. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/764ba1556190db3d97a10013265311e0ffb174d4.jpg Server owners will surely be busy after this update because proper support for spawning bushes, trees, and rocks has been introduced. As we announced at the end of April, we’ve decided to wipe characters and server persistence files in order to freshen up the experience and facilitate central economy adjustments on the official servers. The wipe is not mandatory for community servers. If you’d like to learn more about update 1.21, you can find a list of all the changes on our official forums Here We hope you enjoy this latest update and wish you many great adventures!

We’ve got a really interesting theme for this update. This time around we’re getting medieval and traveling back to the Middle Ages! One of the new additions we’re introducing is the crossbow – DayZ’s first ever spring-powered weapon. It can load a variety of bolts and be fitted with a number of sights and scopes. Legacy players may recall this model originally having a quiver, a characteristic we decided to scrap in order to focus on the behavior of bolts. Our aim is to make the projectiles recoverable, as well as animate them with every entity you hit. The ballistic properties of projectiles, along with their recoverability, are the most complex parts of the crossbow, and we are interested to see how they behave on public servers. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/c4e40949f43eb541d0bfdebdf8f563f409a525b0.jpg While the crossbow itself may not be strictly medieval, we have incorporated medieval themed replicas of various items and clothing throughout the world. Don’t worry though – we’ll let you find them on your own instead of spoiling the fun for you here. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/b892feff5ce19e230d058295dbee5669e11e692f.jpg Experimental update 1.21 also comes with rebalanced quick slots, so now you won’t have to open your inventory as often. Fall damage has been rebalanced as well and should be much more readable. Continuing with the theme of readability, you now have the option to adjust the brightness of the in-game UI. Furthermore, we adjusted the lighting of the inventory camera. These two improvements should make your inventory much more pleasant to look at. We also made a few fixes regarding thrown items falling through the ground, and we’re curious to learn how often you stumble upon this issue after this update. One more thing we’re introducing is the ability to spawn bushes, trees, and rocks through the server-side object spawner (and script). Last, but certainly not least, we are in the final stages of testing our Linux server distribution. We encourage anyone on Steam who wants to play experimental update 1.21 to try and do so on the Linux server, as we are monitoring it closely for any issues. If you’re interested in running your own Linux server, you can already do so on the experimental branch. A full list of changes can be found on our official forums. We hope to see you in the public playtests and look forward to hearing your feedback!

        "contents": "Greetings, Survivors! We have released our first update of 2023 today! Say hello to update 1.20! We’ve already started gearing up for a full year of DayZ support and felt it would be wise to spend a bit of time tackling various issues and addressing all the feedback we received during our very busy developmental phase last year. You might find update 1.20 lacking in the content department, but it certainly makes up for that with a wide variety of fixes and changes. There are far too many to mention them all here, but some of our favorites include more vehicle fixes, a resolved ADS bug, connectivity indicators, and improvements to the third-person camera. If you’d like to learn more about everything update 1.20 brings to the table, head on over to our official forums and check out the change notes Here. New assets Mime Masks Carnival Masks {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/473324688eedf619dff5a64b1590a67c78d6ef4e.png Livonia POI This new point of Interest was in connection to a community competition. The winner's art would be displayed in the game and forever be part of DayZ Livonia {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/a47b0d295e52a9059cdc62ea97804b3653422448.jpg While we’re very happy to kick off the year with update 1.20, we’d also like to discuss what’s in store for the rest of 2023. As we teased in a recent live stream, this year is going to be a little bit different. One thing we’d like to clarify is that we will definitely be supporting the game throughout 2023. The content of future updates, however, will be a lot more dynamic in nature, and won’t always deliver the usual template of “gun, feature, bug fix”. The reason for this is because we plan on expanding our focus regarding the possibilities of the DayZ game, brand, and team itself. We can’t offer too many details at the moment, but the following are a few of the areas we’ve begun to look into as possible additions to future updates. Character cosmetics will play a huge role in every update this year. We’d like to grow what is already a massive collection by increasing the variety of loot to be found and offering even more amazing clothes to wear. Don’t expect us to follow other popular games with an abundant amount of pink skins. Think backpacks and survival themes and outfits that exemplify the DayZ brand. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/a1764c1cd2f365960b1f8d803174c13f24dff585.jpg Another element we intend to update later this year is the iconic northwest airfield (NWAF) on Chernarus. Our primary focus will be to simplify the airfield’s layout and make the runway and taxiways more authentic. Obviously a change to this location is a substantial project and will require synchronization with a total server wipe. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/5873bae4199f6b0583d83ef93b13ed1df3751774.png We also plan on focusing more on infected AI this year. We’d like to change the way they move through the environment, as well as how you battle them. There are a number of factors regarding this subject that require further investigation, so we can’t share much more info with you at present. But suffice it to say that the changes we’re considering have great potential to change the PvE aspect of the game for the better. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/58f6f53dc59c85adea0b36bdf1ac63b520dc68b7.jpg Following last year’s addition of Steam achievements in update 1.18, we’ve spent some time thinking about how we can expand the selection of available trophies/achievements. We’ve got a few ideas up our sleeves and will be offering additional challenges later this year for all you completists out there. This year will be less about firearms as we feel there is generally a good variety present and we would rather invest our resources into other features. We would also like to give more attention to some quality of life changes, similar to what we did in the 1.20 update. Furthermore, we will continue the trend of offering more tools to server owners, with our primary focus oriented towards console communities and the ability to manage their server. That’s pretty much it for now. We’re really looking forward to another year of great adventures and hope you’ll continue to enjoy them with us! On behalf of the DayZ team, Adam ",

We were once again able to release all of these updates on schedule, and to include some pretty big additions in terms of assets and features. While all this was happening, the team and its processes underwent major changes as part of the continuous restructuring in preparation for team growth and future challenges. Another aim of ours was to stabilize the game. The stabilization process included a more in-depth look at long-standing issues regarding stability, exploits, and recurring bugs. We balanced these fixes with spectacular themes in every update to generate more attention and continue supporting our marketing efforts. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/63366cb1d787b6432f5289c4e2c4c71115c28c62.jpg Update 1.16 kicked the year off with a clean sweep that was meant to stabilize the build, supported on asset-side by the firepower of the Bizon SMG. Meanwhile, update 1.17 was all about crafting. It introduced improvised bone spears and knives, as well as a very popular mummy outfit made from rags. Update 1.18 set out to define an explosive summer season with both industrial and self-made explosives, and a grenade launcher. Finally, the year culminated with update 1.19, which provided a significant update to our Livonia DLC, including the first large underground area in the game. We also introduced the M1025 Multi Purpose Vehicle, which was supported by an update to our vehicle simulation and character collision that fixed tons of bugs and exploits in the overall gameplay. DayZ 2022 in numbers Game Updates: 4 (1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19) We broke the all-time concurrent PC player record from 2021 in every month but one. The current record was reached in April with 58,523 players. (SteamDB) Daily Active User peaks of 184,000 on PC. Top monthly average of concurrent PC players: 31,070 in January (all-time record, Steam Charts) Last year’s monthly average record was surpassed during every month of 2022, except for March. DayZ saw over 3.9 million new users from January to November Highest average monthly viewers on Twitch: 17,200 in June (all-time record, TwitchTracker) BattlEye bans: 30,000+; reaching a total of 100,000 cheaters banned from DayZ 17,000+ mods created by players 3 seasonal events TELLING A TALE OF THE APOCALYPSE DayZ is all about the survivors and their paths in this post-apocalyptic world. This is why our recent trailers have focused on telling these stories and how they are interconnected and impacted by large scale events. With update 1.19, we were finally able to finish the first major story arc around the character named Hannah. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/bf46536eb9a485be74080c31383af8df99612c79.jpg Hannah was introduced in our previous release trailer back in 2019, when she was ambushed and robbed of her backpack by two bandits with motorcycle helmets. She got her revenge later and retrieved her possessions. A battle-hardened Hannah returned in the trailer for update 1.14, where she witnessed what appeared to be a trigger for a barrage of mortar strikes across Livonia and Chernarus that were infused with toxic gas. Another mysterious character appeared during this turbulent period, this time in the form of the mysterious Yellow King. A bandit with a scarred yellow motorcycle helmet appeared, hunting down survivors while searching for something. The hunt culminated in our trailer for 1.19, when the masked bandit tracked Hannah down at an abandoned underground ammunition storage, which appears to have found (and lost) new inhabitants since the outbreak. After retrieving hidden in a safe, Hannah was ambushed by the Yellow King. She managed to fight him off but lost her lucky backpack in the process. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/b34df71ff43f86d90740d1a414a447b818ce7352.jpg A wounded Hannah escaped from the underground and drove away, but the fate of the mysterious , as well as her pursuer, remains unknown... Huge props to Scott Bowen and the entire video team for pulling off such amazing storytelling! OLD AND NEW FACES - PUSHING THE LIMITS TOGETHER We received increased support from both inside and outside the DayZ team in 2022. While one team member left, the year started big with the return of our former Lead Programmer. Also additional new programmer joined the team to increase our implementation capacity and tackle complex topics. Most recently (Q4), we expanded the ranks of our programmers once again, an established modder known for his participation in some of DayZ’s most popular mods. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/62c6d8f2584154fba1033af4b9e2d597c57f2f1c.jpg Aiding our design team we have a new Designer, who joined us from Publishing QA. We received reinforcements during the second half of the year. Joining us was DOJ, a long-standing DayZ modder who further added to our terrains as an Environment Designer. And let’s not forget a new Artist with thriving experience from one of our other titles (Vigor) who’s pushing us with asset production. By the way, we’re still on the lookout for experienced talent in design and art! We were able to accomplish the enormous scope of updates in 2022 thanks to our cross-project teams, Combined efforts from all our studios, which helped create Livonia’s underground facility and port the vehicle simulation from the lastest version of Enfusion to DayZ. The audio and animation teams also stepped up their game and provided invaluable help. As usual, DayZ as a live service could not exist without the continued support from our friends in Deployment, Backend, Marketing, Platform Support, Publishing QA, Operations, and IT. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/4f505c21e51a74efc696f420055e00a676719870.jpg While we do try to highlight community content and success in our monthly community spotlight. We are well aware of contributions that don't get as much attention due to sheer amount of amazing work. This year the DayZ team got more involved in community events that builds relationship of our team and player base (Including our Creative Lead Adam Francu) Modders, community server hosts, content creators, chat moderators, social leaders, event organizers, forum admins and Proudfoots - \"Proudfeet!\" We aim to expand more on existing features to enrich community led content. A huge special thank you to all! What's next? 2023 is going to be a very interesting year for the DayZ team and Bohemia Interactive as a whole. DayZ currently competes toe to toe with our other well know franchise Arma, and we are very aware of our responsibility in continuing the game’s success. While plans are setting and investigations are a go, We are unfortunately unable to provide more information at this time. We look to giving more clarity of 2023 development in our - DayZ in 2023 Article scheduled for Q1 of 2023. Furthermore you can check TopeRec's Interview with Scotty for some sneak peaks we would like to achieve.

        "contents": "Greetings, survivors! The moment you’ve all been waiting for is here! Highly anticipated game update 1.19 “The Secrets of Livonia” is now live on a stable branch. It brings with it some major changes and additions and is the biggest update we’ve released since the Livonia DLC. So let’s get to it! Thanks to the Enfusion team, we were able to implement the latest version of vehicle simulation into the game. Our primary goal was to resolve long-standing issues with vehicle stability. We’d like to thank everybody who participated in the experimental phase, as it helped us test the vehicles in a live multiplayer environment. We’re still tracking a few lingering issues, but we believe we’ve taken a giant step forward in improving the driving experience in DayZ. The update to the vehicles was quite a substantial one, so you should definitely expect them to behave differently. Hopefully, they’ll be more fun to drive! These changes were reinforced by the addition of various features like the vehicle horn, as well as better feedback of the vehicle’s state in the vehicle HUD. The new simulation also includes support for automatic transmissions, which you’ll find in our brand new vehicle - the M1025 - the first drivable military vehicle in DayZ. We hope you’re going to enjoy this legendary and lightly armored 4-wheel drive monster! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/fea3f8515b36e6263d2eed234ec73b92ea4035d0.jpg Our DLC terrain, Livonia, received a lot of attention in this update. We felt it was lagging behind the base game terrain (Chernarus), so we looked at how we could improve the experience and bring it closer to Chernarus in terms of features. That’s why we added a number of major and minor points of interest, and conducted quite a big balancing pass on the loot distribution. We hope these additions will make your adventures in Livonia more refreshing, with new routes to try and new places to visit. There is one truly special place, which may trigger the end of the adventure for many, since we’ve also introduced some new environmental dangers. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/2d66141d46b8b2f8a49dda60992cb85d1ef7b8e5.jpg Now that we’ve tackled the vehicles, let’s talk about the player character controller changes. We took a deep look into our backlog and resolved many issues that were connected to various exploits (such as glitching through walls and terrain). With these fixes, we’ve also lowered the speed of moving up or down hills, restricted movement in shallow water, and reduced the distance that characters are pushed when falling over edges. Last, but certainly not least, we increased player character inertia, which is mainly noticeable while sprinting, as we felt it was too easy to maneuver around. We understand that this change may not be for all players/communities, so you can adjust the level to your liking through server-side configuration. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/7a86a1d17d741f504fe0593b06f9ac35d4cf372f.jpg But that is far from being all! We’ve also improved the in-game navigation helpers, implemented a GPS receiver, and added on-screen bleeding effects, which will help you notice you’re bleeding much faster, even if your HUD is hidden. Two new civilian firearms have been added, along with new clothing that’s waiting to be discovered. Modders have also received new and powerful in-game tools within the diagnostic executable. These will help modders with configuring new assets, debugging issues, and code optimization. See the documentation here. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/4b4b7391d429e0028511bb1a6dbf2c28a7176e93.jpg If you’re eager to learn more about this massive update, we recommend you visit our official forums for the full change notes. By the way, the time for Halloween festivities is upon us once again. With this release, all of our official servers will be offering various spooky additions to the landscape, so make sure you don’t miss out! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/f8ce444b781e3c72eb10b537a7b67fdfe7e2e939.jpg See you in Livonia, survivors!

Allow us to present the first experimental build of upcoming game update 1.19 - live right now on Steam. This update is definitely one of our biggest since we released the Livonia DLC. It was hard to hide our excitement, which you probably noticed during the various teasers and streams we provided in the past few weeks. It's impossible to cover everything in this announcement, but we will outline the most important parts of the build, along with our intentions behind some of the changes. As usual, if you’re interested in checking out the full list of additions, changes and fixes, head on over to our forums where you can find the patch notes. Here Let’s start with something everybody will notice immediately: changes to the player’s physical movements: Our primary focus was on fixing a variety of bugs and issues, some of which were exploited by players to gain an advantage over others (i.e. clipping through terrain and static objects). We also looked into the issue where falling off the edges was pushing the player far too forward and decreased their speed quite a bit. This means players won’t be falling that far anymore, which will hopefully result in far fewer random deaths from stepping over tree trunks while going downhill in a forest. This will also make jumping more relevant. We fixed an issue that now allows players to move faster up and down hills, compared to flat terrain. This doesn’t mean we’ve slowed a player down more when they’re walking through rough terrain. While it’s something we’d like to do eventually, it was beyond the scope of this update. Moving through water was looked into as well. We didn’t really like that somebody could just sprint through water, so we decided to implement a restriction on hip level, making it so players are forced to walk (or jog, if the sprint modifier is used). Lastly, we looked into restricting player movement while they’re in a sprint. We felt it was way too easy to maneuver at such speed, so we increased the inertia of the player’s character. This affects both the time it takes to reach full speed (or stop), as well as changing direction while in a sprint. We understand that such a change may not suit all the communities out there, so we spent some time on implementing parameters into the server-side json configuration, making it possible for server owners to tweak it to their liking (and revert to the previous state, if so desired). Speaking of characters, we added a new (and optional) on-screen bleeding indicator, which should make cuts much more noticeable. It also allows players to learn about the amount of sources and their severity without looking at the HUD. Seen in the Article Aside from the changes concerning characters, we also implemented the highly anticipated vehicle simulation upgrade. We integrated the latest version of Enfusion’s vehicle simulation into DayZ, thanks to the tremendous help of the Enfusion team. The primary goal was to resolve longstanding stability issues found in vehicle simulation. This is quite a huge change, so vehicles will feel different, and hopefully they’ll be more fun to drive around. Along with the new simulation, we’ve also introduced the ability to have an automatic transmission (with a certain new vehicle ;-) ), a hand brake, and a car horn. The HUD vehicle has also received a much needed update, and now offers drivers more information about the state of their vehicle. Experimental testing is the next big step for this huge chunk of work, and we’re looking forward to your feedback and results from stress testing. We have a dedicated server running the Chernarus terrain, where it’s much simpler to find a working car to drive around. You can find it under the community tab on PC under DayZ EU - DE 3524 (Experimental/Unstable/Inland Spawns/More Vehicles) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/c91398ff7f532c611a0e1795386251cac8c6edee.png Modding with update 1.19 is a whole lot easier now because we’re introducing new tools within the diagnostic executable (DayZDiag_x64). These include a script profiler, a free camera, geometry debug options, a vehicle simulation debug, central economy debugs (including a loot spawn point editor), damage system debugs, and much more. We plan to release documentation on how to use the diagnostic executable and its debugs before the stable release. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/cba317fccac1cf27c24a5ca0536a3b0c07866b51.jpg This update also focuses on our Livonia DLC terrain, where we’ve implemented dozens of new places to explore and perhaps a few puzzles to solve. Both of our terrains have also received new dynamic events. As with any update, you can find some new firearms, as well as some other new items, which will enrich the overall sandbox. We hope you’re going to have a lot of fun exploring the new content on the experimental servers. As usual, if you find a bug or have any sort of feedback, please let us know through our official channels. Thank you! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/5d3c132c197e46a8b909aa4a4d6efe3693709d4f.png See you in Livonia, survivors! On behalf of the DayZ team, Adam See full Article here ",

We’d like to thank everyone who joined the experimental servers and helped us by playing and providing their feedback. We’d also like to offer some info regarding the update to the vehicle simulation. While internal testing is in progress and the results look promising, we were unable to include it in the build for 1.18. we'll keep the community posted on the progress of Experimental servers in near future. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/b35ea2a9f669fa16efcbae00a60865962051d74a.png Now let’s get to the rather explosive content of this update. We are very excited to introduce the first grenade launcher to DayZ – the legendary M79. This single-shot grenade launcher is able to deliver deadly 40mm fragmentation grenades up to a distance of 300 meters and opens a whole new realm of possibilities for encounters. Besides the 40mm fragmentation grenades, we’ve also added 4 different smoke grenades (black, white, red, and green), as well as one special type of grenade, which you’ll have to search for in contaminated areas. We’re also introducing the Claymore - a new and remotely detonated directional mine. Scavenging industrial sites might produce plastic explosives, which need to be combined with a remote detonation unit in order to detonate them from a safe distance. Protector cases can be combined with the electrical repair kit to craft an improvised explosive device that can accept a variety of explosives and can be activated by using an alarm clock, kitchen timer, or the aforementioned remote detonation unit. Being unveiled for the first time as well is a new event item – the fireworks launcher. Commonly found in amusement parks, this item is ready to light up any party, or be used, perhaps, as a distraction while dealing with the infected and other survivors. Aside from explosions, we’ve added our smallest firearm to date as well. The Derringer is a two-barrel, .357 pistol that can be hidden pretty much anywhere. Speaking of firearms, the Revolver and Blaze rifle can now be sawn off. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/0cd93e521e02504fa4704c799247fac649310d1c.png You can now stumble upon a new type of dynamic event in the form of an abandoned train. This event makes the existing railway networks of Chernarus and Livonia worth traveling as it adds new points of interest in areas that were relatively empty in the past. The trains come in a variety of types and spawn military, industrial, and civilian loot. Read more including Steam Achievements from our article.

We’ve got a lot of new tools to discuss this time around, changes, and fixes. Head on over to our forums for the official change notes: Change Notes First off, there are plenty of new explosives to be found and made. There’s the Claymore, a directional mine found in high-tier military areas which can be detonated remotely. Next we have a powerful plastic explosive that can be found in industrial areas and combined with a new remote detonation unit, which is meant to be detonated from a safe distance. Finally, all you crafty survivors out there can also create an improvised explosive device from a protector case. This device accepts a variety of explosives found in the game and can be activated with a remote detonation unit, alarm clock or kitchen timer. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/ba1d4b1208115b881568b89da1b25403776b55a3.jpg Speaking of explosive things, we’ve also added a grenade launcher. We chose to go with the legendary M79 – a single-shot grenade launcher – because we feel this one fits our gameplay the best (unlike the underslung grenade launchers for existing assault rifles, which we deem too powerful). We experienced a few challenges in terms of aiming, so please let us know how the current setup works for you. The M79 also comes with a variety of 40mm grenades, which can be found in different places across the world. There are other firearm additions as well, but we’ll leave it up to you to discover what they are. Since many of these newly created items are considered very powerful combat and base raiding tools, they will be difficult to acquire under the balanced economy we intend to provide. To allow for easier access during this experimental period, we’ve adjusted the spawning of these tools so they appear more frequently and in lower-tier areas. We hope you’re going to have fun with all these new tools, and we look forward to bumping into you during our regular Friday playtests!.

There's only one rule in the popular post-apocalyptic zombie game - survival. But the longer you survive, the more dangers you're likely to face. Like most survival games with a major online component, you're going to meet other players, and they're more likely than not going to want to take all of your stuff. That's where <strong>DayZ base building</strong> comes in. A major feature that sets the standalone version apart from the original ARMA 2 mod of yore is that you can now build your own complex bases, rather than just try to hide a tent somewhere. Whether you're taking over an existing structure and slapping on a door, or building your own watchtower from scratch, you can now create secure places to rest up and defend yourself. It's not as hard as it sounds to create a basic stronghold - either from scratch or using existing buildings - but the more complex the er, <em>complex</em> you want to put together is, the more materials you'll need to gather.

        "contents": "Greetings, Survivors! Update 1.17 just went live on Steam! While we’re already hard at work on the next update, this text will elaborate on the most important aspects of 1.17. Our primary focus this time around was on the themes of accessibility and crafting. If you’re interested in seeing a full list of the update’s additions, changes, and fixes, See link at bottom of the post. One of the key parts of update 1.17 is the addition of new sensitivity settings, which offer players the ability to adjust the sensitivity of their controls in different scenarios such as aiming, moving, and steering. Another important part of the update is the revised existing control scheme for controllers, the addition of an alternative control scheme, and a large bug-fixing pass on a variety of control-related issues. The alternative scheme gives us room to adjust the controls without affecting the existing scheme in a major way and enables us to resolve some long-standing issues with the existing scheme. We will be processing feedback from the stable branch of 1.17 and possibly adjusting the alternative control scheme further. Control schemes can be changed while in the main/pause menu through the controls screen. Crafty survivors can now make an improvised gas mask filter, a belt out of rope, a cookware stand for a fireplace, and a whole new set of improvised clothing made out of rags. The crafting of a stone knife has been revised and bones can now be used to craft a bone knife. Meanwhile, both improvised knives can be used to craft an improvised spear. Some non-craftable melee weapons have also been added, such as a meat tenderizer (which works as a weaker hammer), a cleaver, and a pitchfork. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/1c2a76d81c9c3ecb36e5c2860d65bbb8c49b63e1.png Speaking of weapons, the selection of civilian firearms has been expanded, and now includes the CR-550 Savanna - a powerful .308 hunting bolt-action rifle, as well as the .308 Longhorn pistol and the legendary P1 9mm pistol. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/c3bd6222896472e462d3fc2154e6cad5f8ae83c7.png Last, but certainly not least, we’ll be kicking off our Walpurgis Night event alongside update 1.17, which will run from April 19th to May 9th.

If you’d like a complete list of additions, changes, and fixes, head on over to our forums for the official change notes. (Steam). Cookware (including cookware stands) can now receive damage when used over time, and lard is no longer required when preparing food. Gas mask filters are no longer ruined when depleted and can be refilled using charcoal tablets. We’ve also implemented a new system of universal temperature sources, which allow us, for example, to have torches increase a character’s heat comfort. Last, but certainly not least, we’ve added 3 new civilian firearms, as well as a pitchfork and craftable spear. We hope you’re going to enjoy this experimental branch and look forward to meeting you all during our regular Friday play tests.

        "contents": "Game Update 1.16 is now live on Steam. Greetings, Survivors! 2022 may have only just begun, but the first update of the year (1.16) has already been released on Steam! We dedicated the end of last year and the beginning of this one to a “clean sweep” type of update, which is to say that we went through our backlog and fixed everything we could within a given timeframe. This approach also gave us the opportunity to plan out the content for future updates. If you’re interested in learning more about our plans for this year, make sure to check out our DayZ in 2022 article for all the details. Update 1.16 contains a variety of fixes and adjustments which are aimed at certain balancing and gameplay issues. This can be read in detail on the following article: https://dayz.com/article/game-update/DayZ-Update-1-16 Server-side gameplay settings (introduced in a previous game update) were expanded by adding the ability to switch off the 2D map layout for a more immersive experience (only the 3D map will be available in this instance). You’ll also now find additional parameters to control the length of the unconscious state to tailor the experience according to play styles (i.e. interaction-based vs PvP servers). Speaking of servers, we have also increased the limits of script class indexing, which were causing issues when combining a larger amount of mods together. Modders and server owners will also appreciate the extensions within the firearms API, which now allows the spawning of magazines and bullets directly into newly created empty firearms (this was only possible before through the central economy). And it wouldn’t truly be an update without us introducing a bit of content with it. That’s why we’re happy to introduce the Bizon, an iconic AK-based .380 submachine gun with an extra-large magazine. We’re also introducing the alarm clock, which allows you to see the time in-game and offers you the ability to set an alarm for a certain time in order to scare your enemies or lure the infected. We’re already hard at work on the next game update, but we hope you’ll have fun with this one for now.

Unfortunately, according to a developer of Warhammer: Vermintide 2, this seemingly isn't the case. In a <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=6#c3202622271470957243\">Steam discussion thread</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/easy-anti-cheat-not-as-simple-as-expected-for-proton-and-steam-deck/\">GamingOnLinux</a>), Fatshark staff member Hedge revealed that there are in fact two versions of EAC: EOS (Epic Online Services) and non-EOS. Hedge says this presents a problem for some developers who want their games to run on the Steam Deck, because \"most games historically use Non-EOS EAC. It's the one Vermintide 2 uses as well. Epic only added Proton support for the EOS version of EAC. Therefore, in order to implement Proton support for Vermintide 2, a huge amount of reworking of the EAC implementation would be required\". Dead by Daylight developer <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-by-daylight/steam-deck\">Behaviour Interactive previously alluded to this issue</a> back in October, leading to concerns that it and other popular Steam games may not work on the Steam Deck at launch (if at all).

Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and us switching up office spaces, we managed to release those updates on schedule. DayZ's 3rd year of live ops support and 8th year of development overall was focused on supporting our creators. We revised our systems for post-processing and particles, and the newly implemented contaminated areas are fully configurable, even without installing community mods. We love our PC modding community, but we care about the entire community regardless of what platform they’re on, including consoles which can’t benefit from modding. That’s why we nurtured the ability of console users to modify gameplay experiences through server settings, thereby enabling them to easily adjust to settings that we saw appearing frequently on PC mods. This applies, among others, to tweaking building restrictions, altering stamina consumption, the spawning of structures and loot, and adjusting contaminated areas. We already saw plenty of creativity emerge from the communities, and we’re excited to see what they’ll do with these new tools. 6 new/returned weapons Introduced contaminated areas Wound infections Increased support for modifying console community servers Continued modding support Read more about the year in review Here to learn more about what we got up to and snippet of future focus.

It is such a humbling experience and we sincerely hope that you’ll stick around as we strive for newer heights! At the moment, nominations for this year’s Steam Awards are underway and we’d like to ask for your support once again by nominating DayZ for the Labor of Love Award. The criteria for this prestigious award is as follows: “This game has been out for a while. The team is well past the debut of their creative baby, but being the good parents they are, these devs continue to nurture and support their creation. This game, to this day, is still getting new content after all these years.” This, as you already know, perfectly describes what DayZ is. It’s not just a labor of love that belongs to the dev team or Bohemia Interactive in general; it also belongs to you, the community, who’ve made friends through the game and collaborate with each other to tailor the DayZ experience to your unique tastes. This year, the team has worked rigorously to release update after update and introduce new content that includes various firearms, new playstyles and upgrades, customizations to community servers, and an entirely new environmental threat that radically intensifies the DayZ experience. It’s been a long and arduous road for the team but it’s totally worth it because we know and love our committed community of modders, content creators, and server owners who have been pushing out amazing content throughout the year like creative tools, week-long competitions, and a plethora of new community maps. We are incredibly grateful for your support and believe that both the community and developers deserve this amazing award. So if you feel the same way, please cast your vote and show us your support.

Up to 60 players on a server will be tasked with a single goal: survive this new unfamiliar land for as long as possible, by any means necessary. This is DayZ, this is your story. What to expect with update 1.15: We're introducing another bullpup assault rifle - the iconic AUR. It comes in two variants, both accepting 5.56 NATO ammunition. The A1 variant offers limited customizability with its fixed scope and a dedicated 30 round magazine. The AX variant on the other hand offers a full range of options for the scopes, suppressor and is compatible with the standardized magazines as well. Besides a new rifle, we're also introducing new civilian gear - the hunter vest, which offers great storage capacity and can be found around the hunting areas. Finally, we're also opening up the combination of the barbed wire and baseball bat to craft a unique looking and powerful barbed wire baseball bat. A brand new female survivor is now available in the main menu character selection to increase the variety. Speaking of characters, we've resolved a major clipping issue of balaclavas and all available head gear items. While looking into the head gear, we've also made a change that allows you to wear a head torch in the glasses inventory slot, meaning from now on, you'll be able to wear a head torch together with your head cover of choice. We've adjusted consumption and thresholds of the player character's water and energy in a way that makes it harder to retain higher values, while making it less impactful on lower values (that includes lower damage to a character's health). The adjusted thresholds give you better heads up on when exactly you should start taking care of the needs of your character and the decreased processing rate of the stomach contents means it's harder to eat everything at once (eating will generally take more time). As part of our ongoing efforts to support a more immersive experience, we're adding audio feedback to the switching of the fire modes on a firearm. We've also added new onscreen directional hit effects. These replace the previous red-colored vignette effect with a splash texture, which also helps you to determine the direction from which an attack has come. This feature is also fully customizable server-side. Server owners are receiving additional tools to manage their servers without the need for directly modifying game files through the addition of server-side gameplay settings. These include a new way of configuring the weather, adjusting various gameplay features (such as construction, placing limits, stamina and the new hit indication effects) and finally, a new way of spawning various objects to enrich the environment through the new object spawner. We're open to any feedback you may have on the current options or even things you would like to see included in there in the future. If you had fun with the Halloween event we ran a few weeks ago on the official servers, then we have one more surprise for you this year - the Christmas event. We've worked hard on this one and we hope you're going to like it! Santa is coming down to the lands of Chernarus and Livonia, literally.

As part of our ongoing efforts to support a more immersive experience, we're adding audio feedback to the switching of the fire modes on a firearm. We've also added new onscreen directional hit effects. These replace the previous red-colored vignette effect with a splash texture, which also helps you to determine the direction from which an attack has come. This feature is also fully customizable server-side. Server owners are receiving additional tools to manage their servers without the need for directly modifying game files through the addition of server-side gameplay settings. These include a new way of configuring the weather, adjusting various gameplay features (such as construction, placing limits, stamina and the new hit indication effects) and finally, a new way of spawning various objects to enrich the environment through the new object spawner. We're open to any feedback you may have on the current options or even things you would like to see included in there in the future. If you had fun with the Halloween event we ran a few weeks ago on the official servers, then we have one more surprise for you this year - the Christmas event. We've worked hard on this one and we hope you're going to like it! Santa is coming down to the lands of Chernarus and Livonia, literally.

However, according to the developers behind the survival experience DayZ, the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-open-world-games\">open-world game</a> might pass on support for the upcoming portable powerhouse. As shared by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/qmno1q/dayz_unlikely_to_support_steam_deck_according_to/\">Joshersratters on Reddit</a>, DayZ's creators, Bohemia Interactive, responded to a Twitter DM inquiring about Steam Deck compatibility by saying support would be \"unlikely\". While the developers didn't specify why the game would be incompatible, Battleye's \"opt-in\" policy could be linked to the studio's decision to forgo support. Of course, if Bohemia has opted out of Battleye for Steam Deck, there could be a good reason for the decision. As you'd perhaps expect, Valve's dinky <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-gaming-pc-build\">gaming PC</a> isn't as beefy as a fully-fledged rig, meaning performance issues could arise if games aren't optimised. While DayZ still has <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/search/?q=dayz\">29,339 concurrent players</a>, the fact it's now eight years old could also mean it has a smaller team maintaining things behind the scenes. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/steam-deck-support\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/update-1-14-contaminated-areas-le-mas\">DayZ's latest update adds contaminated zones, so get your hazmat gear ready</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/update-1-11-sval-rifle\">DayZ has gotten a major update, a new rifle, and a complete character wipe</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/update-2020\">DayZ studio shuts down - but updates should keep on coming</a> ",

        "contents": "Greetings survivors, It’s only been a few weeks since we released the biggest update of the year (1.14), but here we are again, this time with the first experimental release of Game Update 1.15. We will cover the parts of the update we’d like the most feedback on while avoiding any talk about the new content, which you can find by exploring the experimental servers or by visiting our official change notes. One of the update’s major additions is the new server-side gameplay settings. These new files (within the mission folder) aim to make certain gameplay adjustments more accessible without the need for modding the game itself. For now, these include control over the following systems: - Weather behavior through various parameters in cfgWeather.xml - Player stamina system in cfgGameplay.json - Placing and construction restrictions in basebuilding in cfgGameplay.json - Support for overriding other gameplay parameters, currently stored within the server config (to simplify the approach) We’re already looking at expanding the customization options even further for future updates. If you already have any feedback or requests, do not hesitate to share your thoughts on our feedback tracker. Documentation for all these new settings will be available around the stable release of 1.15. This game update also focuses on improving feedback to the player through the addition of onscreen directional hit effects. These accompany the already present red vignette and are positioned in a way that will help you locate the direction from which you are getting hit. Work on these effects also allowed us to start working on the onscreen effects of bleeding. This will greatly improve feedback on the bleeding, which is currently lacking (especially when playing without HUD). While we’re pretty excited to bring this into the game, we’re going to need more time to develop it. Therefore, it’ll be included in a later game update. Another thing we’ve done is balance the player character’s stomach, water, and energy storage. Our primary goal was to decrease the strength of a character's water and energy reserves, which had previously allowed players to stay alive for hours without the need for food or drink. These changes include: - It is now easier to get out of dangerously low energy and water levels, but harder to retain high values for a longer time. - It takes longer for water and energy to be processed from stomach contents. - Slightly lowered damage to health during dangerously low levels. - ]Adjusted thresholds to better reflect the actual state of water and energy levels (primarily to give sufficient time to react). There are also a lot of smaller changes that greatly improve the overall experience: - Fire mode switching now has audio feedback; mainly useful when playing without the HUD. - Performance during shooting has been greatly improved. - Some firearms had their fire rate increased to match their real-life counter parts more closely. - Unconscious state from a firearms hit has been prolonged (compared to 1.14, not the original 1.12 values). - Head torch can be worn with most head gear (takes glasses instead of head slot). - Most of the small bushes now yield long sticks after being cut down. - Night vision scopes now have the ability to switch between day and night modes while in hand. - Ski mask clipping with head gear has been solved. Finally, we’ve added a new female character and there are some new toys to be found in the world as well, but we’re not going to tell you what they are. We hope you’re going to enjoy this update and we’re looking forward to meeting you on the experimental servers during our Friday play tests. As usual, if you run into any issues or have some feedback for us, do not hesitate to contact us through our official channels (forums, feedback tracker).

Bohemia Interactive says it's given special attention to the new contaminated zones to make sure they're creepy and immersive, adding new visual and sound effects to enhance the feeling of being in a lethal environment. The zones come in two varieties: there are static areas, where you'll find high-tier loot hidden away among the clouds of gas and hordes of undead; and dynamic areas, which move around the map.

Believe us when we say it’ll change your adventures in DayZ forever. Before we dive in, however, we’d like to thank everyone who participated in the update’s experimental phase and submitted their feedback. It really helped us out a lot! Now let’s get to the update. We’re introducing a new type of passive environmental threat - Contaminated Areas. These areas come in two variants: static and dynamic. Static areas are meant to lock away high tier loot, while dynamic areas make the world more dynamic. We’ve worked hard to make your experience as immersive as possible through various visual / sound effects. These areas will also finally make use of already present NBC gear such as suits and gas masks. Should anyone enter these areas unprepared, they’re going to face the deadliest disease we’ve ever implemented. All you wilderness survivalists out there will be happy to learn that we’ve added hunting traps. This includes a bigger fishnet trap, a small fish bottle trap, and a snare trap. Each trap is capable of catching its own unique animal based on where the trap is placed and the type of bait that’s used. We’ve also added a new booby trap - the tripwire - everyone's favourite trap to stumble over in the most unwanted situations. Our animations department has prepared a new set of animations for the bullpup rifles. This has allowed us to introduce a first in DayZ - the LE-MAS assault rifle! This exotic looking assault rifle uses 5.56x45mm ammunition in its unique 25 round magazine and offers single, burst, and automatic fire. Why did we choose to focus on this rifle and not the bullpup present in the legacy version of DayZ, you ask? Sadly, all of the weapon assets from the legacy version need to be reworked, while the LE-MAS was made with the new animation system in mind. For more exciting new additions including Heli crash sites, Nightvision scope and New stealth kill.

If you’re interested in seeing the full list of changes, you can visit our official change notes for PC here. Danger is looming over the lands of Chernarus and Livonia. If you’ve seen our teaser from last week, then you’ve probably figured out what that means. If not, allow me to present the contaminated areas. These areas come in two variants: static and dynamic. Static areas are meant to lock away high tier loot, while dynamic areas make the world more unpredictable, which spices up random encounters and forces survivors to reconsider their loot routes. We’ve worked hard to make your experience with the area as immersive an experience as possible through various visual / sound effects. These areas have allowed us to add new functionality to protective gear such as gas masks and NBC suits. On top of that, some major changes were introduced within the central economy configuration to make sure entering the static areas is worthwhile. We also added a new infected type to keep you on your toes at all times. We’re definitely interested in hearing your feedback regarding the balance of accessing the area, your experience inside the area, the loot from the static areas, and overall performance in general. We’ve made this feature fully customizable, so any server owner can add / remove new static areas as they wish. Coupled with our work on the contaminated areas, we’ve finally taken a look at the obstructed view of the head and face, as well as other gear-related effects. This includes a reduction in what you can see while wearing various head and face coverings, as well as effects for glasses and even breath condensation on the glass of a gas mask.

Before we dive into the contents of the update, we’d like to take a moment to thank everyone on PC and Xbox for participating in the experimental phase. If you’re interested in a detailed rundown of the changes we made, head on over to the changelog forum posts (PC, console). And if you encounter any issues, we’d love it if you let us know on our channels. Feedback tracker Now let’s take a look at what’s been changed and added! We are introducing the legendary M16-A2 assault rifle together with its iconic 3 round burst mode. This rifle accepts standard 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and is compatible with most M4-A1 magazines. Due to the lack of an attachment rail, its customizability options are very limited, which means it is easier to find in the world than the M4-A1 rifle. We also have some new weapon attachments.

Next we have two new magazines: a 45 round for KA-74 rifles and an actual 60 round standardized magazine for 5.56x45mm rifles, which replaces the standardized coupled 30 round magazine. Now let’s talk about the changes to player vs player combat. We’ve changed the way the unconscious state works during firearm combat, making its length dependent on which caliber is used to knock down a target. There were also a number of changes made to player damage zones, which will reduce the chances of a double punishment in the form of falling unconscious and breaking a leg, as well as seemingly invincible arms and shoulders when wearing a ballistic vest. Speaking of vests, we have reduced the strength of police and plate carrier vests. The plate carrier vest is also less durable and all of the ballistic vests have higher repair kit consumption. We have also further iterated on the infected AI. One of the biggest changes is making the individual infected more distinct in their abilities by adding new types of infected and scaling the infected difficulty with the player's overall progression through the game world. Other changes to the infected AI include: A stealth approach is now more viable because of increased noise dampening (lesser ability of infected to hear noise through obstacles) and lowered noise from a player’s crouch sprint. Infected are now attracted by smoke grenades, flare gun flares, fireplaces, and explosions. Infected are now more likely to leave the position of unconscious players, thus preventing the frustrating waking up - unconscious loop. All infected attacks are now blockable and overall infected attack speed has been reduced (but not down to 1.11 levels). And last, but certainly not least, we are introducing the chance for wounds to get infected. This means that from now on, you should always keep an eye on which item is used to treat wounds. We’ve added a new label on the items, displaying their disinfected state, which allows you to quickly recognize which items are safe and which are not. Damaging disinfected items removes the state and requires applying disinfectant again. If a wound gets infected, the infection is spread over two stages. The first can be treated by disinfecting the wound, while the second is more punishing and needs to be treated with antibiotics. The second stage also includes a new fever condition, which is triggered during influenza. We hope you are going to enjoy this update. We wish you safe adventures and hope you’ll listen carefully over the summer because a storm is coming! \"Is there anything more frightening than people?\" - Svetlana Alexievich Read more via our article: http://bit.ly/2UGSXT4 Patchnotes/Changelog PC: https://bit.ly/2UKl83u Console: https://bit.ly/3wBivhu Thanks from the DayZ Dev Team",

That means we’ll be conducting complete wipes (all characters, items, vehicles, bases etc) on our official servers on release day. We don’t have an exact date set in stone yet, but we’re hoping the update and wipe will occur around the middle of July. Like the previous wipe, we'll be increasing the occurrence of helicopter crash-site events with high tier loot on all official servers in the days leading up to the wipe. This will start from July 2nd and run up until the update releases. To clarify, this wipe is only happening on Official servers, Community server owners can decide to wipe at their own discretion. Please note that we won’t be doing these wipes with every game update, though we do want to ensure there’s an ending and a new beginning every once in a while. We intend to synchronize wipes and server take-downs with updates to keep the impact on our active player-base as little as possible. We’ll also be shutting down a number of official servers (you can see the full list of affected servers below). We’ve been seeing more and more players migrate from Official to Community and we’d like to merge the less populated servers together. Furthermore, most of these servers were a temporary measure meant to run parallel to sales / promotional periods. One final note: we’ll be adding temporary servers for capacity during peak times. This is to ensure overall stability for the player base. We hope you like what we’ve teased so far with Update 1.13. We’ve been overwhelmed by your helpful feedback and really appreciate your involvement as a community!

At 163 km², Livonia is big enough to provide you with hours of exploration as you learn the lay of the land. Its varied landscapes and numerous landmarks provide an abundance of places for players to take shelter, build a base, and hide from both the infected and other survivors. Idyllic environment. This Eastern European terrain covers the southern Topolin-Nadbór region of the larger Polish-speaking country of Livonia.

Fresh hunting ground. Livonia's food supply is scarce, and players wanting to survive will have to quickly learn how to forage, fish, and hunt in this new wilderness to keep from starving.

Maybe nostalgia is starting to creep in. I do miss the kinder Chernarussian days when we would drive out to the countryside and celebrate this time of year by dancing to music around a bonfire. Adults would dress up as witches and wizards; children would get their faces painted. I remember one time when my idiot of a brother tried to barbecue while drunk and nearly caused a forest fire. Thank God for that fire safety officer. Speaking of forests, I’ve noticed these intense flickers of fire at the edge of the woods, up the hill across from my current camp. It’s too bright to be another camp but not bright enough to be a large base. I do see some infected walking in that direction though. I’ve been debating whether I should go over there, and I have to admit that my curiosity is starting to get the better of me. Maybe I’ll check it out in a week or so when I move on from here. A Walpurgis historian's overview Night of the Witches (Čarodejnice in Czech) is celebrated on the night of April 30th and during the day on May 1st. This popular event is meant to commemorate Saint Walpurga, an 8th century abbess in Francia, who battled against rabies, pestilence, whooping cough - even witchcraft. Citizens used to celebrate her during the modern days by building a large bonfire and having parties around it. A figure of a witch would be placed on top of the fire to signify the “burning of the witch.” Of course, since large fires were potential fire hazards during that time, local firefighters would be deployed to the event for safety. Something new to look out for In Chernarus (resembling the culture of the Czech Republic) and Livonia, this is celebrated by large bonfires put up by each village In modern days, local firefighters are present to ensure the safety of the fires (nowadays they might be considered an additional hazard) Around the bonfires, you will be able to find items of local witches List of items: Structure: Bonfire Cauldron Witch Hat Witch Hood Birch Broom Crooked Nose See you there Survivor!",

        "contents": "Hello survivors! We’re excited to announce that game update 1.12 has been released on Steam! Before we dive into the contents of the update, we’d like to take a moment to thank everyone on PC for participating in the experimental phase. This update offers plenty of changes in the game and your feedback during the experimental phase was very important to us. If you’re interested in a detailed rundown of the changes we made, head on over to the changelog forum posts (Link below) . And if you encounter any issues, we’d love it if you let us know via the Feedback Tracker. Now let’s take a look at what’s been changed and added! We start with the most important part of the update - changes to player vs infected and player vs player combat. The scope of these is far beyond anything we’ve done before. Here’s a quick summary: Infected are deadlier up close due to the increased frequency of their attacks and higher resistance against damage from melee. To counter their attacks up close, players need to use heavier weapons when trying to stun them. Their senses were tweaked in a way that makes them slower to react to nearby noises, making a stealth approach and stealth kills more viable. Infected are also more likely to leave their target alone if they lose it and they won’t attack unconscious players anymore. A massive balancing pass was done over existing firearms, making them more diverse while keeping rarity in the world in mind. This primarily includes a focus on non-automatic rifles being stronger and more precise than automatic ones. We also overhauled the audibility so smaller caliber weapons are harder to hear from a distance. The diversification of firearms also affects ammunition properties, which means we paid attention to damage to health, as well as shock differences between individual ammo types. This was also coupled with a major buff to protective gear with ballistic properties (selected helmets and vests), which now protects players a lot more from incoming damage to health and allows for more firefights to end in an unconscious state rather than instant death. - Read more from our article: https://dayz.com/article/game-update/DayZ-Update-1-12 Patchnotes https://t.co/bSHJdBph6X?amp=1 DayZ Update 1.12 Teaser - Out Now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgUVB2ZxqqA",

        "contents": "We’re thrilled to announce that DayZ began the new year with a bang, setting an all-time record in January in average player count for the PC on Steam! We couldn’t be happier that so many of you are enjoying the game! Our main news, however, centres around the release of 2021’s first game update, 1.11. A huge thank you to everyone who participated in the experimental phase of the update on both the PC and Xbox. For those of you who already checked out our changelog, you know that this particular update wasn’t focused on any significant additions to the game. DayZ is a complicated beast, and since we had a fair-sized backlog of issues, we decided to focus on bug fixes and improving the game’s stability instead. With that in mind, let’s take a quick look at what this update actually contains. One of the things we looked at was how the infected collide with players during melee fights and adjusted it so that the infected no longer go inside the player’s character. Getting out of cars had proven tricky in the previous update as well, as some players were randomly teleported onto the car’s roof. This has been fixed and your feet now remain exactly where you’d expect them to be after leaving your vehicle. Sea fishing would also be interrupted at times, but we squashed that issue too and play should now be as smooth as the calm waters. Finally, we improved horticulture in a number of areas, including removing garden plots with the shovel and the infestation of plants. One final bit of news – paired with the update, we had a complete wipe on all official servers. The wipe is meant to compliment the update 1.11 for a fresh start into 2021. It also secures us a clean foundation to monitor the changes made with previous economy updates. You can read our official announcement on the wipe here. As usual, this article provides just a snippet of what is inside of this game update.

It also improves server stability and capacity and has fixes for damage triggers - all stuff you expect to find in a stability patch, but welcome changes for sure. However, there's a new piece of gear you'll want to be on the lookout for now that the update is here. It's the SVAL rifle, which comes with an integrated suppressor and takes 9x39mm ammunition.

We’d like to thank all of you who voted for us last year and helped us secure the Better with Friends Award. Now we’d like to ask for your support once again. There’s only one category for games that weren’t released this year, which puts us in the thick of some stiff competition. Clearly, we’re an underdog in this race. But we are talking about the Labor of Love Award after all, which is a fitting description for our little labor of love – DayZ. Here’s the criteria for the prestigious award: “This game has been out for a while. The team is well past the debut of their creative baby, but being the good parents they are, these devs continue to nurture and support their creation. This game, to this day, is still getting new content after all these years.” As many of you know, DayZ has been available on Steam for nearly seven years now, and our team here in Prague has been tirelessly working on the game in a continual effort to improve it. Some veteran players will attest that it hasn’t always been the smoothest of rides. Others might even say there were moments of pure torment. Nevertheless, we believe (and hope you agree!) that the game has gotten exponentially better over time. Not only that, but we promise to continue elevating the game to greater heights, regardless of nominations or awards. Matter of fact, in addition to our recent 1.10 Game Update, just yesterday we released a new hotfix on our Experimental branch to improve the server performance! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458811/7b0cf6ce36dfd52888a36605bc08b69e6de4e97d.png But this isn’t just about our development team or Bohemia Interactive as a whole. Another reason we believe DayZ deserves the Labor of Love Award is because we’ve been blessed with an amazing community of modders, server owners, and content creators who’ve invested so much of their valuable time to provide unique and memorable experiences to our loyal group of players around the globe. We’ve seen this remarkable surge of support blossom over the last two years and we can’t wait to see where it will go from here. We’d be honored if you’d consider nominating DayZ for the Labor of Love Award, and wouldn’t ask if we didn’t feel our efforts and yours truly deserve it. To cast your vote, please visit this year’s Steam Awards Nomination Page. It’ll only take a minute and we’d really appreciate your support. Thank you!",

There are tons of substantial changes to this update, including the long-awaited return of the M3S truck. Along with a drivable variant, we’ve also added brand new static variants for partial spawning. On top of that, all vehicles now offer increased engine durability during collisions with the environment, as well as the option to repair the vehicle’s chassis with epoxy putty and the engine itself with a pipe wrench (unless your engine happens to be ruined). We also added player damage when jumping out of a car. New shelters have been added! They come in three variants (stick, tarp, leather) and offer basic storage capacity, as well as protection from the rain. Speaking of the elements, cold mornings and warm afternoons are more realistic now, as are local wind speeds and altitudes. Furthermore, players can temporarily contain heat from fireplaces, the user interface now contains information about the heat insulation qualities of an individual piece of clothing, and heat insulation / maximum absorption limits for all clothes have been rebalanced, offering players a variety of choices regarding protection against the rain or cold. Leg fractures are back as well, along with improvised fixtures (splints). Legs can be broken in all kinds of situations, including combat, stepping on a bear trap, falling or jumping from a great height, and even while jumping out of a car. Keep in mind that if you don’t fix a fracture with a splint, you’ll suffer limited movement, as well as frequent shock damage, which can render you unconscious. Visualizations of current shock values have been added (i.e. how close you are to unconsciousness), as well as when the actual shock damage is dealt. Applied splints are now visible on the injured player as well. Rounding out the update, the signal pistol has returned and can light up the night sky in four distinct colors, the longevity of items has been lowered dramatically, and locked doors stay locked during server restarts, while the rest of the doors are randomized. Localization tweaks have also been added, including the introduction of localization into Brazilian Portuguese. Finally, DayZ and DayZ Livonia will be fully playable on both PS5 & Xbox Series via backwards compatibility! Read about it here: https://dayz.com/article/general/dayz-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s",

In addition to this, we’re also adding one more brand new gun to DayZ - the Deagle. This beast of a pistol is available in silver and rare gold variants, features a nine .357 round magazine and fits the re-introduced pistol scope, to engage targets over longer distances. Developers have also been working on some balancing of the durability of individual firearms, mainly aimed at lowering the durability gap between chambered and magazine based weapons. With this, we’ve also increased the durability of suppressors and removed the ability to repair weapons with duct tape along with their attachments. Keep an eye out and hold on to those weapon repair kits! A new structure for base builders has been added - the flagpole. It aims to make base management easier by continuously refreshing the lifetime values of items and structures around. Meaning that you will no longer need to run fence by fence to keep them alive once you build and activate a flagpole in your base. Just keep an eye on how low the flag is, because its position defines how many refresh cycles remain. There are 27 flag variants; we hope you find your personal favorite.

Following his tree related rant, modders added an abundance of Christmas trees into the game, with the firs literally raining down on Summit1g's character while he took a mini streaming break.</strong> Summit1g had once been a regular player on the DayZ scene, but until his very recent return, had spent several years away from the game. Upon his return, he immediately criticised the trees, tweeting \"DayZ needs to remove 50% of their trees and 80% of the Christmas trees,\" doubling down on his criticism as people defended the forest's density and realism. Some were unhappy that Summit1g immediately began suggesting changes in a game he had barely started playing again, especially as someone of this stature in the streaming scene is more likely to be listened to than the average schmuck. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/dayz/summit1g-trolled-trees\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/dayz/lirik-grenade-fail\">Lirik's unfortunate grenade throw in DayZ ends in death</a> ",

The rifle uses .22 ammunition (added to the game via the 1.05 update last year), comes with various magazines, and has the ability to mount a hunting scope. And speaking of long-range engagements, the Sway and Hold Breath mechanics have been adjusted, which should make distance shooting a bit easier. New base building improvements focus on the balance-of-destruction of various structures, such as fences, watchtowers, and tent objects, and the update also includes the addition of the Canopy Tent, Indoor Fireplace (oven), and Direct Cooking Slots (fireplace grill for meat). Additionally, the update comprises general gameplay tweaks, bug fixes, and UX improvements. Finally, 1.08 will bring an updated Saint Roman Ski Resort, Biathlon shooting range, and a race track to the ChernarusPlus terrain.

As time passed, the game&apos;s scope grew, devblogs and roadmaps were published, and new features like multiplayer were discussed with the community. In 2014, things began to change. Communication from the developers slowed to a trickle. Multiplayer was shelved. On February 3, 2015, developer Paul Hart revealed that Under The Ocean&apos;s programmer had quit. Hart said he still wanted to finish the game, though he didn&apos;t know when or how it would happen because he would be &quot;restarting the project from scratch.&quot; Refunds weren&apos;t an option&#x2014;the money earned from Early Access sales was gone. Hart continued to work alone, though said he couldn&apos;t devote much time to it. The eighth alpha still exists in the libraries of those who bought it, but the game <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/under-the-ocean-pulled-from-steam-early-access/\"> is no longer on Steam </a>. When we think of gambling in games our minds immediately go to loot boxes, but there&apos;s no bigger gamble than Early Access. Players hand over money thinking they&apos;re buying a game, but they&apos;re not. They&apos;re placing a bet. They have no way of knowing if they&apos;ll win, or even what they&apos;ll win. Often it works out and everyone, devs and customers, are happy. Other times players wait years and wind up with a game they don&apos;t like, one vastly different than the one they thought they were paying for, and occasionally, no game at all. And sometimes they&apos;re left with just an ancient alpha collecting dust in their library. The Early Dozen Steam Early Access was launched in March 2013 with a total of 12 games. Some left Early Access fairly quickly, including ArmA 3 (which launched within the year), Kerbal Space Program and Prison Architect (which arrived in 2015), while others took quite a bit longer, like Kenshi, which didn&apos;t launch until 2018. A few of those original 12 never arrived, like Under the Ocean and a rhythm game called 1&#x2026; 2&#x2026; 3&#x2026; Kick It!, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/15540/1_2_3_KICK_IT_Drop_That_Beat_Like_an_Ugly_Baby/\"> which is still in Early Access </a>.&#xA0; Another of the original 12, Space sim Kinetic Void, left Early Access in 2014 to overwhelmingly negative reviews, largely because many players felt it hadn&apos;t launched as much as been abandoned. Survival game Starforge left Early Access in 2015 to mostly negative reviews, and the developers removed it from Steam completely in 2017. DayZ entered Early Access in December of 2013. It sold 400,000 copies in a week. But Early Access quickly became a big hit with developers, particularly solo devs and small teams and studios (though AAA devs and publishers have used it too), because it allowed them to earn money from their unfinished games and use it to fund the remainder of development. It was a hit with players, too, because it meant they could jump in early to play games they might otherwise have to wait years for. They could typically pay less than a full release would cost but receive a complete version when development was complete. And there was also the promise of participating in the development of a game through feedback and communication with the devs, an enticing hook for the most passionate enthusiasts. Why just play a game when you can help shape it? All genres of games can appear in Steam Early Access, but survival games leaned on it hard, mostly due to Bohemia Interactive&apos;s DayZ. After three years as an extremely popular mod created by Dean Hall for ArmA 2 and 3, the standalone version of DayZ entered Early Access in December of 2013. It sold 400,000 copies in a week. Within a year Bohemia Interactive had sold over 3 million copies of a game that had bugs so bad players couldn&apos;t even climb ladders without dying instantly, netcode that had survivors desyncing &#xA0;across the map, and zombies that could walk through walls. It was an incredibly engrossing and exciting game&#x2014;I personally put in over 200 hours&#x2014;but it was also a bit of a mess, and it would stay that way for years. Pardon our dust After DayZ became a top seller and massive success despite not even being finished, Steam quickly became packed with unfinished Early Access survival games. Many were just frameworks: an open world and a few basic survival systems to keep players busy while the devs continued to work on other features. Players could scavenge gear and supplies, eat and drink to keep their meters filled, engage in some basic crafting systems, and deal with some sort of threat: zombies usually, wild animals occasionally, and most often, other Early Access players. A new genre was born: not just survival games but <em>Early Access</em> survival games. Customers became impatient with delays, poor communication from developers, and features that either never arrived or wound up being cut. I love survival games and bought and played a ton of them in Early Access myself, many of which I barely remember now. I bought Starforge, one of the original 12. I bought <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/reign-of-kings-diary-i-bashed-my-face-with-a-rock-i-kept-in-my-butt/\"> Reign of Kings </a> (made by the developers of Starforge). The Long Dark, Rust, Ark: Survival Evolved, Subnautica, Just Survive (H1Z1 at the time), Unveil, Miscreated, Empyrion, Frozen State, Hurtworld, Grav, Better Late than Dead, Three Days, The Solus Project, and at least a half-dozen more. Some of these Early Access survival games went on to eventually be completed. Some still remain in Early Access. A few turned out great and became big or modest hits, while others stumbled, fell, and faded away like Under the Ocean. Most, at some point, drew ire from Early Access customers who became impatient with poor communication from developers, infrequent updates, and features that either never arrived or wound up being cut&#x2014;a normal occurrence in closed development but one tricky to explain to thousands of people who have already paid for and are playing the game. Feedback loop And then there was all the waiting. As more games missed milestones and deadlines and revised their roadmaps to extend their stay in Early Access, sometimes for months or even years longer than planned, players became more skeptical of the system. Many began to feel less like they were contributing to a game&apos;s development and more like QA testers who had to pay for the privilege of finding and reporting bugs. For better or worse, they were getting what they asked for: a transparent view of the difficulties and realities of game development. But the popularity of Early Access survival games continued. Ark: Survival Evolved sold millions of copies and is still one of the most-played games on Steam, though it weathered a number of controversies in Early Access, including selling DLC while still in an unfinished state and a sudden price jump from $30 to $60 prior to full release. The Long Dark experienced several delays before leaving Early Access, but is a great game and a massive success. Rust left Early Access last year <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust-will-leave-early-access-in-february-but-its-not-finished-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">but in an &quot;alpha&quot; state</a>, according to its creator Garry Newman. It&apos;s currently one of the top ten games on Steam. Then there&apos;s The Stomping Land, a dinosaur-based survival game that raised over $100,000 on Kickstarter before entering Steam Early Access. It <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-stomping-lands-dinosaur-modeler-gives-up-moves-to-a-new-game/\" target=\"_blank\">was delayed and then abandoned</a> by its creator, leaving backers unable to acquire refunds and leaving several artists on the project reportedly unpaid for their work. Just Survive spawned King of the Kill, a massively popular battle royale, but the survival mode languished for years and then shut down for good in without ever having been finished. DayZ, meanwhile, finally left Early Access at the end of 2018, five years after it set the trend, and even after all that time it still didn&apos;t contain all the features originally planned. That same year, another post titled &quot;<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/227720/announcements/detail/1700563260683998722\"> The Last Update </a>&quot; appeared on the Steam community page for Under The Ocean, stating that game was essentially dead. Currently if you attempt to open the last published roadmap in Google Docs, you&apos;re informed that the &quot;File is in owner&apos;s trash,&quot; the bluntest of epitaphs.&#xA0; The developer has promised a free key to any upcoming (and currently unnamed) projects for customers that provide a receipt for Under The Ocean. &quot;I want to start to tackle smaller projects that I can realistically finish between working a job and being a decent father, and I hope you join me for the ride,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Maybe one day Under the Ocean will live again.&quot;&#xA0; Anything is possible. I just wouldn&apos;t bet on it. ",

But players and zombies aren&apos;t the only hazards you&apos;ll need to worry about. There are bears in DayZ now, and not just in Livonia but also in the survival game&apos;s original map, Chernarus. &quot;This Eastern European terrain covers the southern Topolin-Nadb&#xF3;r region of the larger Polish-speaking country of Livonia,&quot; read the Steam store page. &quot;The new topography brings lush green landscapes, dense forests, overgrown fields, winding rivers, serene lakes, murky swamps, an array of dilapidated structures, and various remnants of an abandoned society.&quot; And bears. It also brings bears. To my eyes, Livonia doesn&apos;t really look all that different from Chernarus, though I&apos;ve only seen a handful of screenshots (you can see for yourself below). I also worry a bit that since you need to buy the new map, it could fracture the DayZ community a bit&#x2014;I expect tons of DayZ servers will want to host the new map, which could give players of the original Chernarus map a harder time finding a place to play.

        "contents": "Following a turbulent and frankly amusing couple of weeks, DayZ&apos;s Australian ban is no longer official, with the country&apos;s Classification Board issuing a new MA15+ classification today. The new classification is the result of a &apos;modified&apos; version of the game submitted to the Classification Board. This version is more than likely the one <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/au/dayz-will-be-changed-everywhere-because-of-the-australian-ban/\">which removes</a> the offending depictions of drug use from the game. The offending content involved the use of marijuana as a health item in the game, and if there&apos;s one thing that rubs the board the wrong way, it&apos;s incentivized drug use. Weed isn&apos;t currently in the official build of the game, though it was set to arrive via DLC. Those plans have been <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/au/dayz-will-be-changed-everywhere-because-of-the-australian-ban/\">thwarted</a>. The game is still unavailable to purchase on Steam at the time of writing, though that&apos;s likely to change in the coming days.&#xA0; The board has issued several &apos;Refused Classification&apos; rulings of late, which means a title is effectively banned in Australia. Of most interest was yesterday&apos;s Bonaire, which is <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/a-rockstar-title-called-bonaire-has-been-refused-classification-in-australia/\">an unannounced Rockstar Games project</a>, more than likely an expansion for Red Dead Online. But We Happy Few and Kingdom Come Deliverance have both been banned of late too, due to recent DLC additions.&#xA0; Cheers, <a href=\"https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/08/the-modified-version-of-dayz-has-been-rated-ma15/\">Kotaku</a>.

Tim Quilty, Liberal Democratic Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council, said the &quot;absurd&quot; ban was triggered by Bohemia Interactive&apos;s plans to include cannabis as a healing item. The developer hasn&apos;t yet confirmed which in-game item fell foul of the Australian Classification Board, but players can use morphine to heal and the game files mention cannabis, which is illegal in Australia.&#xA0; &quot;What makes this ban especially absurd is that Australia has an R18+ classification for videogames...refusal of classification should be reserved for illegal materials, things like child pornography and snuff films that should never have been created in the first place. It should not be used for zombie survival videogames. &quot;Sadly, the developers of DayZ have caved,&quot; he said in the Parliament of Victoria on Thursday, referencing Bohemia&apos;s decision to <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/dayz-will-be-changed-everywhere-because-of-the-australian-ban/\" target=\"_blank\">change the game worldwide</a> because of the ban. &quot;Australia is once again the wet blanket and laughing stock of the whole world. It&apos;s an embarrassment that we obediently let our government treat us like children. While the rest of the world is legalizing cannabis, we are banning representations of cannabis in videogames.&quot; You can watch his speech below.

The key objective is to keep the gameplay as authentic as it was, so players are not affected by this change.&quot; The specifics of the changes haven&apos;t been detailed, and it&apos;s especially strange because DayZ doesn&apos;t depict recreational drug use. It does, however, contain morphine, which caused similar problems for Bethesda, prompting them to change its name to Med-X in Fallout. There are files for cannabis, too, though it doesn&apos;t appear in the live game. If Fallout is anything to go by, simply changing the name should appease the board. It&apos;s all very arbitrary and unhelpful, of course, and if there was a real issue, a name change wouldn&apos;t solve anything, but at least it won&apos;t be too disruptive for players. &#xA0; ",

It&apos;s not unusual for games to not receive a rating in Australia, often leading to developers making changes to fit the draconian rules, but DayZ has been available in Australia for years. It entered Early Access in 2013 and finally launched last year.&#xA0; The <a href=\"http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=gz0aSYFv0o1BKPOzy7Etbw%253d%253d&amp;ncdctx=s4WpdN3XPMCekIxVnkOX26Cfvi5J9BQPhs8Wo1nuP3TnFisvGzKrxTNaA6aKhvkX\" target=\"_blank\">classification page</a> (cheers, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/cn1bbe/dayz_refused_classification_in_australia/\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a>) shows the decision was made in June and was applied for by Five Star Games, an Australian distributor. The reason for it being refused classification, which essentially means it&apos;s banned, is that it depicts naughty things that might offend.&#xA0; It apparently depicts or expresses matters of &quot;sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified.&quot; DayZ was already rated, so it&apos;s not clear why it was refused classification when it&apos;s exactly the same game. We know DayZ is getting a physical edition this year, which is probably why distributor Five Star Games is involved. What doesn&apos;t make sense is why the rules would be different for digital and physical games.&#xA0; So far, it&apos;s yet to affect Steam, as DayZ continues to be sold in Australia, but this may halt the physical launch. I&apos;ve reached out to both Bohemia Interactive and Five Star Games for more details.&#xA0; ",

DayZ is now out on all the major platforms – PC, Xbox, and PS4. You've probably seen team changes on social networks and are wondering: what's next? Of course, that's only natural, and today we would like to talk about the current issues, the expectations set by both the DayZ Mod and 0.62, and the future of the game. Past, Present, and Future Parity with 0.62 and the DayZ Mod – full parity isn't possible because of the engine specifics. While features from 5 years ago are exciting, we want to remind you: most of the features didn't really work properly back then, and this is why it wasn't a final game. You might question the necessity of a new engine, but for those who took a long break from the game, it's plain to see just how much of a difference it has made. DayZ runs a lot smoother on the new engine. Although it might be hard to notice the change when you play daily, taking a step back should help to highlight many of the improvements that have been made during development. And these improvements are strengthening the game every day. We see it through the steadily increasing player count (even on PC) since March 2019 (public data is here). We see it in Twitch statistics – with more channels streaming the game and more people watching (link to Twitch stats). It might be a far cry away from the numbers of 2013, but for an almost 6-year-old game, it's pretty good! Of course, we will continue to work on DayZ to make everyone's experience better. Let's take a more detailed look at the game and its future: Advanced health system – We improved it in 1.04 and will continue the balancing. However, at this time we will not commit to implementing complex medical/injury gameplay – while this is desired by many hardcore players, we are still struggling to fully explain the complexity of the existing system to the majority of players. Moving forward, we are working on a nice balance between authenticity and accessibility. New content (guns, cars, etc.) – As you know, we have already added some of these. More will follow, but keep in mind that it will depend on how quickly we can achieve this year's goals. Modding support – We will improve the user experience for both modders and players. For example, we will soon bring animation tool support. Stable base building – A large part of this is the matter of balancing, and it's one of our key objectives for the year. Our focus for DayZ for the rest of 2019 will be: bug fixing, stabilizing, balancing, and modding support. We also plan to release an official DLC this year (keep your eyes open, and follow us on social media for updates). Additionally, we are currently experimenting with Survivor GameZ (a mod and popular tournament from the past), and will possibly bring this to DayZ as an additional game mode. About people It's normal – especially in this industry – to move on after working on a particular project for several years. And after major releases are done is the most likely time to do so. With DayZ, it's no different, and after releasing 1.0 on PC and console, some people are moving onto other projects internally, or leaving the company. It should go without saying that no matter what, these people will always be in the hearts of the DayZ team. While these are by no means the only team changes, we wanted to at least address the public faces of the game who are leaving: Peter, Lead Designer, who led the design direction of DayZ through many tough years. Eugen, Project Lead, will always be loved for his honesty and open ears to both players and developers. Martin, Brand Manager, is in our hearts for his effort to finally bring DayZ successfully to players on Xbox and PlayStation. Baty, Community Manager, loved for all the personal care for our community and interactions with our player base. Everyone who worked on DayZ not only has a great line in their portfolio, but the tremendous support of both us and the community behind them, and we wish them all the success in the world. Press F to pay respects. ",

        "contents": "DayZ, the game about roaming a post-Soviet wasteland looking for can openers (<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/dayz-review/\">among other things</a>), is getting a battle royale mode in the form of Survivor GameZ. DayZ veterans will recognise the name: it&apos;s the name of a mod and tournament founded in 2012 by former DayZ Creative Director Brian Hicks and Jordan Tayer, back before the core game went standalone. Now, six years later, it&apos;s coming to the official standalone game. The first closed alpha is &quot;just around the corner&quot;, according to the official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DayZ/status/1148594583166734336\">DayZ Twitter account</a>, and sign-ups are available <a href=\"https://dayz.com/sg-alpha\">here</a>. The original mod supported 32 player duos, and played a tad differently to modern battle royale games. But its undeniably influenced the genre as a whole, with PUBG creator Brendan Greene citing it as an influence. But none of the people responsible for the original mod are involved in this new Bohemia-helmed iteration. Hicks, who left Bohemia last year, told us in an email that he&apos;ll be rooting for the dev team at Bohemia Interactive Bratislava, but hopes they&apos;ll not rush it out the door. &quot;The Survivor GameZ was a labor of love for the team involved in it,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;Long before the battle royale craze took hold, the Survivor GameZ team managed to set records in the video game livestream industry and create genuine memorable moments. This was all done on a shoe string budget, and with the free time we all had outside of our jobs back then. Even though it took years to convince Bohemia Interactive&apos;s management that a team last man standing experience in a post-apocalyptic world was worth investing in, we were all elated when they chose to purchase the property from us. Early on there were a significant amount of lofty plans associated with the sale. A Bohemia Interactive Seattle office, Survivor GameZ as a stand alone title, and while we did push forward on many of them, none of them seemed to come to fruition. Despite that, Bohemia Interactive Bratislava has pushed forward with a DayZ DLC model - and I&apos;m certain they have put together an exciting experience.&quot; He continued: &quot;That said, neither myself nor the rest of the original founding Survivor GameZ team have been engaged by management at Bohemia Interactive in regards to the design, or functionality of the Survivor GameZ. Due to this, I am uncertain as to the state or feel of the offering they have talked about today. I can only hope they have held true to the design, and heeded my words of caution when we made those early plans. That the Survivor GameZ can *not* make a reappearance until the game itself is reliable, smooth, and as bug free as possible.&quot; Survivor GameZ was a community-driven enterprise created by enthusiasts, so its audience could forgive its shortcomings. &quot;We got away with a lot with the original Survivor GameZ, primarily due to the fact that those competing in it understood that this was a part time gig for the team - and that we all had other responsibilities,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;That does not apply to a professionally released game or DLC, and the market for battle royale style experiences is seasoned, with an intelligent and demanding audience.&quot; Survivor GameZ will at least play quite differently to the likes of PUBG and Fortnite. As the alpha sign-up page <a href=\"https://dayz.gamepedia.com/Survivor_GameZ\">explains</a>, each match comprises three phases, with the first two of these confined to specific parts of the map. Available loot changes between these phases, as well as hotspots where the most powerful items spawn. The third phase opens the map entirely but spawns an &quot;endgame interaction object&quot; which, naturally, will attract remaining players. &quot;This object is always in the lumber yard area,&quot; Bohemia&apos;s description <a href=\"https://dayz.com/sg-alpha\">reads</a>. The player&apos;s distance from this area will determine the damage they take&#x2013;the closer they are, the safer they are.&#xA0; It&apos;ll be interesting to see whether Survivor GameZ can gain traction in a flooded scene.

Or at least adding one as an optional mode. To Bohemia Interactive&#8217;s credit, Survivor GameZ doesn&#8217;t sound like the standard &#8216;closing circle of death&#8217;. Instead, it&#8217;s more inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)\">the original Battle Royale film and novel</a>, with players constrained to looting, shooting and evading zombies in a series of safe areas. Matches end in a rush for a final objective with the power to wipe other players off the map.

Along with many quality of live improvements, fixes and tweaks, it reintroduces two .308 caliber weapons and what&#39;s arguably the most luxurious transport option the post-apocalyptic Chernarus offers: the mighty Olga 24 sedan. While the 1.02 update does not have a strict theme, a lot of work has been done to streamline the inventory design and functionality (yes, you can move with your inventory open again!). The game design team also put emphasis on promoting stealth gameplay when dealing with the infected, and also went through a couple of iterations on the night time experience. Get all the details and full patchnotes below! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bJ_sBgLTxo New vehicle Olga 24 Once a high end, \"Executive\" level car, the Olga 24 is a four-door Sedan easily able to reach top speeds on the Chernarussian roads. https://i.imgur.com/pV0YlXp.png New Firearms LAR The select-fire rifle LAR is used by specialized military forces.

To kick things off, I have some interesting facts for you from our animation team. The animators have already made or started progress on 5660 animations for DayZ, and 4169 of those animations are currently being used in the game. And another interesting fact - the longest animation we have is shaving which clocks in at 400 frames, meaning it's just a little over 13 seconds long. Thank you Adam Oresten for this interesting info! https://i.imgur.com/S6Xl8P2.jpg  The Xbox community has a lot of questions and we decided to answer them in a live stream. We took the frequently asked questions and issues you've sent to us in theXbox Feedback Round - January 2019 on our Forums and we were talking about them on the live stream. Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBuRO9FP9SI  I can't forget to mention it was Valentine's Day. All of us get from our nice colleague Ket (who's taking care of all the crashes you send, and takes her lovely huskies to the office every day) a DayZ heart cookie. https://i.imgur.com/u5LO356.jpg But we get nice stories and wishes from you too. Look at this cute picture. It's Valentine's gift from Kyla to her other half - a picture of them playing DayZ together for the first time. It's so romantic and it is cool to know you can find the love of your life in DayZ. https://i.imgur.com/KQJi02l.jpg And thank you all for nice wishes and pictures. It warmed our hearts. ",

We've just released the PC Stable Update 1.01 on Steam (both game update and server files). This is the first in a series of Platform Updates that we will publish throughout the year, with the focus this time being on stability, fixes, server performance improvements, and the introduction of two new firearms. https://youtu.be/caGOYM7eeYE  New firearms With each Platform Update, we're aiming to expand the variety of content available in the game. Our choice for 1.01 were two classic 7.62x39 rifles previously available in the legacy builds: the SK 59/66 and the CR-527, also supported by the re-introduction of the Hunting Scope! SK 59/66 A ten-shot semi-automatic rifle fed from an internal magazine. It is an older model, but still reliable, using 7.62x39mm rounds. Can be equipped with a PU scope and an improvised suppressor. https://i.imgur.com/nT6pLLM.png CR-527 A bolt-action hunting rifle, fed from a detachable magazine. It's light-weight and accurate when used at intermediate ranges. Uses 7.62x39mm rounds. Can be equipped with a Hunting Scope and an improvised suppressor. https://i.imgur.com/beTYF95.png  Persistence fixes Undesirable persistence wipes were definitely among the most annoying issues reported in 1.0. With 1.01, we're introducing a system of Persistence Backups that aims meant to prevent problems with saving of the persistence data on the servers. This system will be available to both official and community owned server. We've seen some pretty good results on the Experimental branch so far. In any case, we will still be closely monitoring all incoming reports should any loot, bases, or other persistence data get deleted after server crashes/restarts.  Server Performance Optimizations Good server performance is critical to ensure an enjoyable DayZ gameplay experience. In 1.01, our programmers have made some solid progress on that front. Official vanilla servers running at full capacity with 60 concurrent players should no longer be witnessing flying cars and other shenanigans on a regular basis. As far as community/modded servers go, please understand that increased player counts may and other modifications to the server setup have a significant impact on the server performance, and problems may occur. We will continue with further optimisations over the upcoming updates. The most curious of you can take a look at the report on this topic by our Lead Programmer, Mirek Maněna.  Voice communication improvements The voice chat in 1.01 is using a completely new codec that bumps the overall quality of the Voice over Network sound - especially with a high quality microphone. We've also added a mumbling sound filter for players who try to communicate when their speech is restrained with a rag.  New status indicators & damage tweaks As a first step towards balancing the health and damage systems, we've added new icon status indicators that better communicate bleeding damage and the effect of medication (for example, the vitamins will now boost your immune system). We've also made some adjustments to the player damage, with the most visible example being the reintroduction of a bleeding damage penalty when walking barefoot. Furthermore, we removed the chance variable for bleeding damage dealt by bullets. Now, every bullet scratch causes bleeding 100 percent of the time.  TrackIR Support TrackIR is a head tracking input device that allows you to use freelook independently from your mouse controls, and 1.01 now fully supports this input method. Popular and proven in Arma, introducing this input method was pretty straightforward for us, so we made that option available already. If you own TrackIR, you'll definitely have some fun when driving around in your ADA!  50+ other changes and tweaks In addition to the highlights, we've introduced over 50 other changes and tweaks that make DayZ a better game. Read the full changelog below!

It means sorting through, and selecting features, content, and timeline of their delivery - in practice a lot of meetings, whiteboard scribbles, and digging through our backlogs trying to identify what we're able to deliver this year, and when. In the meantime, normal development continues, and we have deployed a first bug fixing patch, with more bug fixing ahead of us of course, as we also have a backlog there to go through. The first quarter of this year is pretty much all about spring cleaning, and us getting on track to more scheduled Stable Platform Updates bringing new content and fixes. The first Platform Update is on its way to be released in February, and we will share more details once it's live on Experimental. We want to improve the game in many areas. We also hear you loud and clear and are aware of a vast amount of reported issues. They will get the attention they deserve when there's a right time for that, for now, let's look at some of the most critical and immediate ones.  Top Community Issues Server Performance - server performance affects everything, from user actions taking too long, doors not opening, infected that stutter, to vehicle physics behaving in weird ways. Most of the gameplay can get affected when the server FPS dip below 20, and currently, that's happening on full or high population servers more often than acceptable. As such, this is our top priority to sort out. While the build out there right now has seen a noticeable FPS increase on low population servers, it still does not scale well enough when more players are active, and we are tracking possible causes of this server performance drop. https://clips.twitch.tv/CarefulJoyousPhoneJonCarnage Persistence - right now, we are preparing a safety net for persistence that will help the current shortcomings where entire areas get wiped when the server crashes during the writing process of the snapshot of the world state. In simpler terms, the persistence data does not save correctly because of a crash. The proposed solution is in testing and will land on Experimental once ready. When that happens, we will do our best to share useful information on the usage and functionality of the safety net solution. https://i.imgur.com/3NhmX0l.jpg Picture by GallopingGepard Server Browser - we know the new server browser still has its flaws, and performance issues which are getting in the way of the DayZ experience. We are looking into possible improvements on a more granular level; however, those might take time, so at first, we will dig into the issues that damage the experience the most. Once there is more information to share, we will provide an update. https://media.giphy.com/media/fimJ6EBodrxMgCVKKf/giphy.gif Animation issues - we are tracking multiple issues that break characters/weapons and more, and these require engine level fixes that are in discussion right now. Once e details get sorted out, and fixes are confirmed, we will talk about these in greater detail. https://i.imgur.com/GdvoG6j.jpg The issues above are our primary areas of interest as of now, but the list of reported issues goes on, from bullet damage to medical items not serving any real purpose, or item placing being very limited, and more. While the list above does represent some of the reported issues (arguably the ones that break the gameplay experience the most), it does not mean we're not considering, or working on the rest.  Modding We'll do justice to our company motto - Curiosity, Creativity, Community - by delivering significant modding improvements this year. Documentation, samples, and fixes that make new things possible are all in our pipeline. We will look at the topics of licenses and content usage, as well as making sure that with upcoming Platform Updates, we provide Experimental server branch to everybody so that both server owners and content creators can look at the game changes happening, and make necessary arrangements for their creations. We're already seeing lots of cool creations in the Steam Workshop (some prime examples in the video below!), and it'll be exciting to see what's possible in the future. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pcfwt8RHsA  Weapons We have a massive weapons backlog to go through, and you can expect that we will not only look into current issues with firearms (both visual and functional), damage and unconsciousness values but most importantly into that big stash of weapons that haven't been implemented yet. Our weapons strike team has already managed to make steps toward having two new firearms implemented in the upcoming February Platform Update. We will share more details when they're ready.  Vehicles Vehicles have a lot more polish coming to them this year in terms of stability and functionality. As already mentioned, we know and understand that server performance has a huge impact on the experience, especially when player counts go beyond the recommended 60 players on community servers. Server optimisation plays a huge part in our early spring cleaning, so bear with us. While this is, of course, important, we can't forget that we should expand the variety of vehicular transport; this year will bring more options to players. Once again, we will share more details on the upcoming vehicles once we're sure we're ready to deliver.  Consoles Recently, we've opened a round of Community Feedback targeted at our Xbox Survivors, and it proved to be a great source of useful information. Our console specialists in Bratislava are already looking into Xbox specific issues that were reported often and can be scheduled for a relatively easy fix, and there are of course the more complex issues like rendering and performance drops that are being investigated. DayZ launched with very decent frames in Xbox Game Preview, and we believe we can get rid of the current drops. It will take some time though. We also know that we still have a large sleeper community on PlayStation 4 patiently waiting for a release. While we are currently not able to dedicate more resources to advancing with another platform, we're taking small steps towards a PS4 release later this year.  Communication With many internal changes in planning and how we approach update releases overall, we will also need to be rethinking how often and in what forms we're communicating with you. We still have a lot of brainstorming to do, but it's very likely that the frequency of development Status Reports will no longer follow the 2 week period. Instead, we'd like to think of ways how to more actively work with what's happening in the community, engage in the events organised by community server owners, and improve the direct communication across channels. Before the PC 1.0, we've made an attempt at Focused Feedback rounds with our game designers, and we'd like to get back to that idea when we know our developers can invest the time into carefully evaluating the feedback we receive on balancing, or specific game design topics. What we mentioned today is merely a fraction of things that are ahead of us this year; there's more to share down the road, but only when we're ready to talk about it. Once our internal roadmap is fleshed out, we will start our deep dive into how exactly DayZ will change this year. Until then, see you all in Chernarus! - Eugen Harton / Project Lead ",

It has been a bit over a month since our last Community Spotlight and a lot has happened since then! In December we released DayZ 1.0 on PC. It was definitely the craziest month in the office and the devs really deserved their Christmas holidays. I know we've been pretty quiet this year so far, and I've even noticed that some of you think we're still on holiday somewhere, but that could not be further away from the reality!  Most of the team has been back to their stations since January 2nd and there's a lot of buzz in the office. We're working on fixes, planning our road ahead, and also getting ready for our first Platform Update - but I'll let Eugen explain it in his first Status Report of the year, so stay tuned! https://i.imgur.com/tgPHWVX.jpg https://i.imgur.com/4Cw4SqA.jpg We are collecting feedback from the Xbox community because the Xbox version still has several specific issues, and we want to know them all. If you are an Xbox player and have some feedback, here is the place to talk about it. We've organized a 5 Year Anniversary Live Stream in December and answered a lot of questions, so if you missed it, here's a VOD of the live stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dl2YbbhESQ For the live stream, Tim and I organized a special community event for our content creators and a bunch of other members of our community. The event was about attackers assaulting the defenders inside their base. The defenders were asked to build and defend a complex of buildings, the attackers had to kill them all. https://i.imgur.com/p33fnwF.jpg If you want to know some stats from the battlefield, here they are: DayZ 5 Year Anniversary Stream Results: Hero of the Attackers - AnarchyHD (7 kills) Hero of the Defenders - M1ndr (7 kills) First Blood - M1ndr after 3 minutes Highest Kill Streak - Anarchy (7 kills, stopped by DrDeSync); M1ndr (7 kills, stopped by Moondye7) Blood Enemies - Fadez and Jonny Rotten traded Kills Brought a melee weapon to a gunfight - and won - Uncuepa: 2 kills with the Wooden Axe; Catfu: 1 kill with the Combat Knife Last Men Standing - DrDeSync, Dizzy and Gary were the last surviving defenders Immortal Warrior - Dannyboyy did not die during the event. The best motivational speech - MrMoon We definitely want to keep doing live streams, so stay tuned for more - and feel free to send us some tips about what you'd like to see us streaming! Let's check the community content. Our friends at the Australian DayZ podcast Compass asked us for an interview and we joined them for their latest episode. Eugen and Peter were talking about some interesting topics and if you are interested in DayZ development, you should definitely check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovhdvgBYe18 If you are a DayZ beginner, you will maybe appreciate some community help: Recently, my favorite \"DayZ teacher\" has beenArchie Stormcloud, who has his own \"DayZ school\". Check out his videos, they are funny, informative and entertaining.

BarelyInfected has prepared a guide for base building. It can come in handy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOk9GwZvc3I Another amazing piece of work from Asmondian. He has created a series of #dayztips pictures with instructions how some things work. Let's check out some of them: https://i.imgur.com/tGhVL0F.png https://i.imgur.com/xFMMVng.png https://i.imgur.com/GXwXHwF.png https://i.imgur.com/vNCkj2Z.png If you are into modding, you can find some great community mods in the Steam Workshop. The most popular Workshop item -at least for the last month- has been Winter_Chernarus. This mod retextures Chernarus to a beautiful winter environment. https://i.imgur.com/VqwW2wR.jpg And if you run Winter_Chernarus on your server, I suggest you to add Cl0ud's Wintergear, it is really nice. https://i.imgur.com/JSMTGmW.jpg Everyone wants Namalsk, but other terrain creators are already doing an amazing job as well, so now you can check out a new terrain called DeerIsle. It is a 16x16 km size map based on the DeerIsle location in the USA and is still in development. You can try the 3x3km starting area on the creator's server 85.25.214.246. Here is a sneak peek by the map creator JohnMcLane. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLJVCc1zy_Y And here is a first encounters video by TheRunningManZ. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFWN9xsj18 I want to show you one more video, which the DayZ team really likes. This base is really awesome, good job guys. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP1xHz4tc4Q And the last thing I want to share with you are some examples of amazing handwork skill. dubas_ got this amazing picture as a gift. Why don't I have anything like this on my own wall? https://i.imgur.com/vpFsCKA.png DrZZed shared with us his logo cut from wood. It is huge! https://i.imgur.com/Hf1so7S.jpg I carved a DayZ logo into pumpkin last year and it was so hard. But Reddit user ApersonawithCANCER did the same thing with a piece of wood, how it is even possible to do this by hand? https://i.imgur.com/jxLyMGW.jpg And the last one is a very atmospheric sketch made by Specu85. You are talented, man! https://i.imgur.com/F0lehbk.jpg And one bonus photo to end things in style. Who else is envious of this DayZ command center by DownBy9UpBy5? I know I am for sure. https://i.imgur.com/sjGDvij.jpg As always, it's location riddle time. The location from the latest Community Spotlight was under a little factory west of Lopatino. And who guessed it right? Rosiu (@Rosiu11) DrDeSync (@DrDeSync) Emu Threat (@DayzedEmu) Foxypote (@Foxypoteoffical) Good job, guys. Here's the next one: https://i.imgur.com/pA1e9Li.jpg If you know where the location is, send your answer to our Twitter account with the #DayZriddleTime hashtag. Good luck! That's all from me for now, thanks for all the awesome content you create, enjoy the game and see you in two weeks. - Baty Alquawen / Community Manager ",

        "contents": "February, 2013. Barack Obama is in the White House. &#x2018;Thrift Shop&#x2019; by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is topping the charts. The Harlem Shake is taking the internet by storm. And DayZ, a mod for Arma II, has become such a hit, Bohemia Interactive puts a plan in motion to turn it into a full game. Part survival sandbox, part social experiment, the mod throws 64 players into a bleak post-Soviet apocalypse, sits back, and lets them make their own fun. Five years later and DayZ is a standalone game, having gone through an extended Early Access period. And, well, nothing much has changed. There&#x2019;s something weirdly comforting about the fact that DayZ is still DayZ, with its clunky controls, buggy zombies, and commitment to making surviving as punishingly hard as possible. It&#x2019;s kind of absurd that, in a 1.0 release, there are still problems that have been around since the alpha days. But honestly, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting much else. For better or worse, it&#x2019;s almost exactly the game I remember, warts and all. You still have to run for miles to meet up with friends. The zombies still get stuck in walls or just completely fail to notice you at all. You can scour an entire town for supplies only to find one dirty jacket, a tin opener, and no tins. And the chances that you&#x2019;ll be killed by some unseen sniper, usually seconds after you finally find something good, is always high. At least those damn ladders have finally been sorted out. Veteran players will remember the agony of climbing a ladder and ending up inexplicably dead at the bottom of it. <a target=\"_blank\"> </a> The map, Chernarus, is a former Soviet republic, and dripping in misery If this all sounds a bit miserable, it is. Minute to minute, this is about as gruelling as survival games get. You have an ever-dwindling parade of meters to manage&#x2014;thirst, hunger, temperature, and so on&#x2014;and the general scarcity of items can make staying alive an ordeal. There&#x2019;s nothing more disheartening in DayZ than trekking for miles to a town, only to see all the doors lying open: a surefire sign that someone has already been and no doubt thoroughly looted the place. But this does complement the hopeless, melancholy atmosphere of the game. The map, Chernarus, is a former Soviet republic, and dripping in misery. You get the feeling that even before the zombies arrived, this would&#x2019;ve been an unpleasant place to get lost in. But there&#x2019;s a quiet beauty to be found out there too, particularly in the rolling farmland, dense forests, and sleepy rural towns. It&#x2019;s a fantastic setting, and a welcome change from the more familiar Western post-apocalypses that usually feature in these games. The largest concentration of players tends to be around around cities and military bases&#x2014;where the best loot is often found&#x2014;meaning you can travel in the wilds pretty much undisturbed. When I play DayZ, I&#x2019;m constantly on the move, travelling between towns, landmarks, and other points of interest, grabbing whatever I can find, avoiding trouble if I can. But that means a <em>lot </em>of uneventful running. There are vehicles, but they&#x2019;re often missing parts or fuel, and locating them can be a real chore for a solo player. The sandbox nature of the game means that getting &#x2018;geared up&#x2019; will be most players&#x2019; main goal: finding a gun, ammo, bandages, food, drink, and maybe a nice helmet or something. But the more you hoard, the more nerve-racking the game becomes, because you know that you&#x2019;re just one trigger-happy survivor or mischievous troll away from losing it all. I actually love this, because it makes death mean something. When you die you&#x2019;re unceremoniously dumped back to a random starting location with no gear, and knowing this makes every decision, especially with other players around, loaded with danger. <a target=\"_blank\"> </a> I've become wary of other survivors to the point of fearful paranoia The real thrill of DayZ, and the reason I&#x2019;ve played both the mod and the standalone version for hundreds of hours each, is in the feeling you get when you inevitably bump into another survivor. Even now my heart pounds when I&#x2019;m exploring a town or wandering in the wilderness and I see another player ahead. Sometimes, but not that often these days, they might wave you down for a friendly chat and some beans. Or they might helpfully warn you about a group of bandits (DayZ slang for players who kill other players) in the next town down the road. But they&#x2019;ll probably just shoot you on sight. There are a lot of reasons for this. They might just enjoy killing people. They might want your loot. Or, and this happened to me, the game has turned them into a horrible person. See, I used to be friendly. I&#x2019;d approach people, wave, say hello. I&#x2019;d give them advice or ask if they needed a hand. But after several instances of people pretending to be friendly then stabbing me in the back (literally), or luring me into an ambush, I&#x2019;ve become wary of other survivors to the point of fearful paranoia. That&#x2019;s brilliant, though. It&#x2019;s what makes DayZ such a fascinating, compelling multiplayer game, and far more interesting to me than something like PlayerUnknown&#x2019;s Battlegrounds. In games like that, your only interaction with people is, ultimately, shooting them. But in DayZ, every encounter with another player is an opportunity for a story. Even if you get robbed or handcuffed or humiliated, it&#x2019;ll be something you remember. Incidentally, make sure you play with a mic. Not responding vocally when someone says hello, or orders you to do something at gunpoint, will likely just get you killed. I haven&#x2019;t really talked about the zombies yet, because they&#x2019;re the least exciting thing in the game. Which is, perhaps, a little odd in a game about a zombie apocalypse. When they aren&#x2019;t stuck in the scenery they run dumbly at you, and sometimes they phase in and out of existence like your internet connection can&#x2019;t keep up with them. Then when it comes to actually shooting or smacking one with a melee weapon, there&#x2019;s no sense of physicality at all. Fighting a zombie feels like swatting at a hologram. The combat really is abysmal, and there&#x2019;s no sense of challenge or satisfaction attached to it. They&#x2019;re better than they were in the early days of the standalone, but only just. The result of this is that, rather than something to be feared, the undead are just annoying. There was a point in the mod when the zombies didn&#x2019;t work at all, and I enjoyed that a more because there was nothing getting in the way of the real heart of the game: the interactions between players. <a target=\"_blank\"> </a> These were intelligent humans I was facing, not AI drones I could easily outsmart DayZ is a difficult game to review, because a lot of the time it&#x2019;s pretty boring. There are long stretches of nothing; of rambling across seemingly endless fields, not finding anything in towns, never encountering another soul. But what keeps you going is knowing that, around the next corner, something incredibly exciting might happen. A firefight with a rival group of survivors in a ruined city. A knife-edge stand-off with a gun-toting rival. Someone who hasn&#x2019;t seen you, meaning you might be able to sneak up, stick an axe in their back, and steal that nice jacket they&#x2019;re wearing. Hey, don&apos;t judge me. It&apos;s dog eat dog out there. These snatches of drama are fleeting, but in the right moment there are few games as exciting as DayZ. And, similar to EVE Online, knowing that everything (except the zombies) is player-driven makes it feel extra special. If you get tricked and robbed by a group of bandits, it wasn&#x2019;t some event scripted by a developer: it was dreamed up by a real, thinking human, and that really adds to the experience. In one combat encounter&#x2014;my backpack stuffed with hard-earned supplies, my friend lying bleeding in the corner, two assailants hidden in the distance&#x2014;the exhilaration was incredible. These were intelligent humans I was facing, not AI drones I could easily outsmart. But then it was back to running around the fields, scavenging for supplies, failing to find any, then dying and restarting&#x2014;again and again. DayZ comes into its own when you get a foothold, managing to locate enough supplies and weapons to defend yourself and stay alive. But getting to that point is absolutely gruelling sometimes, and that&#x2019;s where a lot of people will bounce off it. It&#x2019;s a game where you have to work hard to achieve anything, and even then it can be immediately snatched away from you if you make one stupid mistake, or a player decides they want to shoot you for no particular reason. Occasionally, in small doses, DayZ is one of the best multiplayer games on PC. But a lot of the time it&#x2019;s a slow, dull, frustrating, and meandering mess of bugs, broken zombie AI, and weightless combat. So I don&#x2019;t know what to think, really. Some of the stories this game has created will stick with me forever, and that&#x2019;s something to be celebrated. But it&#x2019;s also unforgiving, messy, and doesn&#x2019;t have much respect for your time. If you want a social survival experience that doesn&#x2019;t pull any punches, set in an evocative and atmospheric world, then DayZ might be worth investigating. But if you&#x2019;re after a solid, polished game that always does what it&#x2019;s supposed to, you&#x2019;re going to be disappointed. <a target=\"_blank\"> </a>",

It is time to end the Early Access journey, and start a new chapter for the DayZ development. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8YxinOKNss Over the past days the team has come closer together and worked more passionately than ever to make this important leap happen.

We know there is still a mountain of work ahead of us and the team is not taking this milestone as an opportunity to rest, but as a chance to recover, evaluate, and plan for future. So what's ahead until Christmas? First of all, we've just started our first Free Weekend on Steam, so this is your chance to show DayZ to your friends and invite them to a trip across Chernarus. This will also be the last chance to buy DayZ for 15% off its Early Access price, which will be increased when the free weekend ends on Monday, December 17th (19:00 CET). We are also approaching the 16th of December, marking our 5 year anniversary of DayZ. To celebrate this milestone with you, the team will also have a Live Stream on this Sunday evening, to show you some in-game action and talk about the release. For the following week (17.-21.), we have additional appearances on community streams planned, to share more about what the release means for DayZ and what's to come. This is DayZ. This is your story. See you in Chernarus! ",

It's been a lengthy journey for DayZ, of course; the game started life as a fan-made mod for Bohemia's Arma 2 in 2012, and was an almost immediate hit, reaching one million players in the first four months of its release. As a result of its popularity, Bohemia made the decision take on the project in an official capacity, and early access development of a standalone version, with original creator Dean Hall at the helm, began in 2013. Since then, much has changed; Hall <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-02-24-dean-hall-to-leave-bohemia-and-step-down-as-leader-of-dayz\">left the project</a> to start his own studio in 2014, and the originally PC-only game is now available as part of Xbox One's Game Preview programme, with a PS4 release also planned.

DayZ is going to leave Early Access with a PC 1.0 update on December 13th, after almost exactly 5 years in open development! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KsipmJinTo Everyone on our team has been working hard and will continue for this remaining week to deliver the best launch version we can. With the BETA last month, we've seen the return of the first vehicle and item stashes, as well as the premiere of DayZ base building, the release of server files and the beginning of Modding Support. The most recent Experimental Update has returned horticulture to the game, making survival within your base more autonomous, and allowing the return of the full hermit play style. Backed by the underlying engine changes introduced with the BETA, the 1.0 launch should feel like a fresh new start for anyone who has not played DayZ for some time - so let your friends know that they have a game to play on December 13. Keep following us for more events and information over the course of the next two weeks! See you in Chernarus! ",

Eugen gives an overview of the most pressing issues, and the team leads give a brief recap of their work during the past two weeks. Let's get into it!  Dev Update/Eugen - General status report and overview of current issues Xbox One update/Martin - Basebuilding & Vehicles game update details; DayZ is 15% OFF on Xbox One now! Dev Update/Peter - Focused Feedback, Round 1 Dev Update/Mirek - Car physics, hit registration, and other bullet point updates from the programming team Dev Update/Viktor - Animation polish pass on items + new sickness and character states animations Dev Update/Filip - new infected sounds, clothes/backpack sounds, and other improvements Community Spotlight/Baty - Community Spotlight on your Halloween content, mods, and more  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors! Today, I'm gonna talk about the pressing issues that you are experiencing in-game now, about our update schedule, as well as touching on the subject of things breaking apart as we get fixes in. But before I do all that, I just want to celebrate another milestone in the history of DayZ! To this day, the game has attracted more than 4 million people and I cannot state how grateful we are for all the support you gave us over the years. It's amazing that this genre has grown so much. All that makes me excited to continue, and I'm glad I could be a part of this team and the community for a better part of the last five years.  As we march towards the 1.0 release, we will break things as we apply systematic changes to frameworks that hold the gameplay together. While it may seem as counterproductive from outside perspective with only couple weeks left before the release, there is usually (usually, but not always - truth be told, we make mistakes) a good reason behind it. I'm going to try and break it down for you. When we see an issue somewhere, we have to consider many factors. Our implementation needs to be consistent across the board in the underlying systems. Not only this is good for modding in the long run, it is also very important for us to lower the amount of new issues brought in with every update. In reality, that may mean that while a feature or action might be working right now, we have to break it temporarily, and apply fixes to make sure its implementation is, in the end, consistent with everything else in-game. Having said that, we are not happy about it and understand that it is hurting the player experience. While we have closed numerous bugs with recent patches, and improved many systems from a technical point of view, we introduced new ones that need our attention. Things will stabilise in the coming weeks and post 1.0, and our goal is to benefit from this stabilisation in the long run. Another thing I wanted to touch on was the update schedule. Since the initial switch over to Stable, we have made some mistakes and learned from them. We had a streak of hot-fixes in a very short time period and while we will keep reacting to most pressing issues as quick as we can, we want to stabilise our update schedule to the Wednesday maintenance window. The use of the Experimental branch will be less frequented, but still possible if required. We will try to be consistent, but flexible when needed. We want to get better. Update on pressing issues from the last Status Report We've made some progress on the pressing issues we listed the last time, let's take a look: HIT REGISTRATION We have tracked and fixed a number of hit registration issues over the last couple weeks. To be specific, I'm talking about the inventory manipulation of magazines through double click, which wasn't properly synchronised and caused ghost bullets. Another issue was with zeroing and a reload initiated during scoping/iron sights in a specific way. The most common issue was caused by problems in packet priority and networking. Overall, you shouldn't be seeing hit registration issues pop up too much any more, and I highly recommend you to contact us through the Feedback Tracker if you experience weapons not dealing damage at all. While there are certainly some issues with damage itself left, it is tied to a balance pass and things will get ironed out. I'll also be talking about one specific damage issue that has popped up on our channels recently. CHANGING KEYBINDS The next update should contain the keybinding UI and while still work in progress, it should be a large improvement over what was possible before, and it will also finally be consistent with other UI elements in-game. LIGHTING ISSUES Lighting and exposure settings are being debugged right now and you should see changes coming in over the next weeks, making sure that both day and night lighting problems, tone-mapping, luminosity, light sources and what the community describes as excessive bloom are improved. The issues we are tracking right now require more input from the Engine Team and are planned after the next Stable update. FPS DROPS With the investigation into FPS issues reported, we haven't gathered enough evidence yet. I would like to ask all of you experiencing a decrease over the last few patches to send us information about the server you play on (possible modification causing some drops, even economy changes causing more items to be placed on map), their configuration and drivers to help us iron out exactly what happened and how. Internally, we haven't been able to reproduce it on any range of systems we have available, but we may be missing a crucial piece of information. Current issues As I already mentioned, while fixing some things, we also manage to break them. Let's see what's broken. To make things short for the Status Report, I'm just going to list them as bullet points of current most pressing issues, and you can read the full context and our response in the related forums thread.  Server crashes Vehicles issues Broken play button Persistance issues Gun sounds missing Sounds stuck in a loop Basebuilding issues Shotgun damage issues Night time setup Hit reaction and stun lock VOIP issues Again, please make sure you read the related forums thread to see our replies on the issues you reported. Many of the reported issues can be improved by value adjustments on our end. I want to emphasise how important this balance pass is for DayZ and its functionality. While all sorts of interesting features are in, they require us to review their current state. We need to get dirty to properly configure them. Gun-play, damage values, diseases, economy, persistence, and so on - bugfixing definitely comes first with high priority issues, but a balance pass is what makes the game fun in the first place. We will announce as things get rolled out over the following updates before we reach 1.0. The first thing you should be seeing is recoil and its behaviour tweaks. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Martin Hi everyone! While on the PC side of things, we're in full bug fixing mode, our Xbox Survivors are still waiting for the big update to drop. As we detailed in our Xbox Development Briefing, if things go well, we'd like to release the Basebuilding & Vehicles game update on Xbox this Thursday. This is still with a disclaimer as we'll be going through the final stage of testing tomorrow, but even if we discover some specific issues, this update will still be the biggest Xbox update of DayZ since we launched in Game Preview. We're also right in the middle of the Xbox Black Friday sale, and this will probably be one of the very few chances to get DayZ on Xbox One for an advantageous price (currently 15% OFF at $33,99 / £26,99 / 33,99€). So, If you were considering getting DayZ on Xbox, or convincing your friends to give it a try, right now is probably a good time to go for it. The game will only get better and more polished from here, so while I'm of course strongly biased, I'd say the current price is a pretty decent deal. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/4458811/b5bd4c499e7a893596e50f7bef91b6783f5e4e9e.png - Martin Čulák / Brand Manager  Dev Update/Peter Over the past week, we've been collecting your feedback on gameplay mechanics in the first installment of the Focused Feedback Round on our forums. Below, you can find links to the individual topics. You've sent us countless ideas and suggestions for every single one of them. Status Indicators in the HUD Character Movement, Gestures and Actions New Actions & Crafting Stamina As we are pretty busy with the preparation of the December release, we will take this week to evaluate your feedback before starting round two. We are going to talk about gun mechanics, melee, infected and the damage system, so gather your thoughts for when we open the next Feedback Round. - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek Hello Survivors! As we're all very busy with our tasks, I just wanted to provide a quick bullet point overview of what we have done, what we are working on and what we have planned for the upcoming weeks. Let's go: Done Car physics update; We had to rework the car physics controller as the suspension system was very unstable at lower fps (both client/server side) Hit registration fixes; We've managed to fix one specific hit registration bug caused by packet ordering Support for hearing sounds outside the network bubble (this can be configured in a server config) View distances are now also configurable via server config Voice over Network fixes; We fixed specific issues with 5.1 & 7.1 headphones Aligning characters on sloped ladders Added script API for light sources; Our scripters (and modders) can now script the intensity, colour, and size of light sources and dynamically change them Support for additional character animations - e.g. sickness In progress Overall stability improvements; Mostly crash fixes Modding support; Further script API extensions, filepatching & security bug fixes Further car physics tweaking Input system (allowing the ability to assign key binds) Fixes for applying damage texture to specific damage zones Plans for next weeks Continue with crash fixes Character physical controller fixes Infected AI fixes - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Programmer  Dev Update/Viktor Greetings from the animation team Survivors! We've been very focused on bug fixing and improvements to existing animations and systems in these past two weeks. We have finished a pass on hundreds of in-game items, mostly updating their holding poses to make the animations look more natural, and also to reduce various clipping issues. There are still some problematic items which will be up next. Other than that, we've also worked on bug fixes in the animation graph and animation polish for player character animations. One of the specific improvements is the addition of animations related to various sickness states. Player characters will be able to show signs of being sick by coughing or sneezing, and also to show signs of being too warm/too cold. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Filip Hi all! In the audio team, we've been working on introducing additional variety to the sounds of player movement. That includes three different sounds for movement with a backpack, three new sets of sounds for various types of clothes (represented by the Patrol Jacket, Raincoat, and Quilted Jacket) and noises for movement with the ghillie suit. By now, you have also probably discovered that the leaves are now rustling when players are moving through bushes and small trees. Finally, our infected received new voices, now totaling at four male and two female infected voice variations. - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello everyone, I am leaving to my two-week long holiday today, but I prepared a Community Spotlight for you before I take off. While it's quite some time since the Halloween, I have not had the chance to feature all the spooky screenshots and videos that you've sent me, so this is why I dedicated a large part of my yesterday's community spotlight to those!There ares also photos of our own real-life infected at the Prague Zombie Run, and a many community mods for you to try!

One of our infected joined the zombie-themed night race called Zombie Run here in Prague. The race was 5km long and it was fun to watch people dressed as zombies running around.

Today is a very exciting day for all of us here at the DayZ team. Coming closer to five years of Early Access Alpha development, we are now moving the PC version of DayZ into BETA. What does that mean for the future of DayZ and how long do we intend to run the BETA? Watch our new Dev Log video to find out more. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ZfK6a8T00 To recap, The DayZ BETA shifts our focus from introducing new features and content to bug fixing, stabilization and balancing. The goal is to create a stable and -most importantly- fun experience for our 1.0 release, scheduled for the end of 2018. Worry not, this is not the end of DayZ development: we have more features and content planned after we stabilize the game, and they will come to you as part of free platform updates in the future. The former 0.62 version running on our old technology has been moved to a legacy branch on Steam, and the default (Stable) branch on Steam now runs the new, 0.63 BETA update. So what are some of the BETA highlights? Major engine changes Improvements to game and network performance Introduction of base building Massively improved implementation of vehicles More elaborate AI for infected and animals Major map rework to make Chernarus more beautiful and detailed Ability to run your own servers Modding Support While mentioned as the last bullet point, the modding toolset is equally important to our effort of polishing the game, as it opens a whole new world of opportunities to experience DayZ in different ways. Read more about our modding toolset on our official forums. Pricing plans, and post 1.0 plans Despite our original announcements suggesting otherwise, the pricing will not change for DayZ with the BETA release, and we'd like to reach the final price for DayZ when we release the game out of Early Access. That means for now, DayZ is still available for 27,99 EUR / 34,99 USD. For the rest of the year, we will be working on our post 1.0 development plans and evaluating where we take DayZ next in terms of additional features and content. As soon as we have a solid roadmap in place, we'll let you know through all the official channels. Until then - see you all in Chernarus, and please do report every issue and bug you find to our Feedback Tracker!  ",

Remarkably the plan is for DayZ to get to 1.0 before the year is out. &quot;While there are large numbers of issues left, only about 600 of them are crucial to make DayZ work as intended. We plan to do exactly that.

The tools will launch alongside a DayZ Steam Workshop to make sharing mods easier. DayZ has had a choppy development since it first arrived late 2013 and became a craze for a time.

So apologize this late Status Report, it is worth it. Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, we are listening. We know the last Status Report has started some heated discussion about DayZ. I'm gonna do my best and touch upon multiple subjects you guys have pointed out and make sure your questions don't go unanswered. But first, I also want to  because today is the day that we updated the Experimental branch with what will become the first BETA update. The update itself contains multiple features and tons of content. Just to name the headliners: all new base building, a new implementation of vehicles, player restraining, leaning and more. I'm excited about this first step to a more polished gameplay experience with more endgame goals to achieve.  Farewell, 0.62 - 0.63 is fully taking the reigns Not only have we hit Experimental today, but tomorrow, we want to open another floodgate. Since we're no longer working on old technology, the 0.62 version is now becoming a legacy to look back at and learn from. We believe we are past the point where 0.62 is a good first entry into the world of DayZ. So tomorrow, we will be going through a clean-up in our Steam back-end and shuffle things around a bit. The current 0.63 will be moving to the default branch (what we call the Stable branch, as in the first thing that installs when you click on DayZ in Steam, and a version that most if not all community servers will run). 0.62, then, will be moved to its own \"legacy branch\" for future reference. This will make sure that players coming back in will get in touch with the new version of DayZ, and won't be facing a situation where they start up a game and can't join almost any server due to version difference. That way, we can focus on what the future of DayZ should be and we will deliver updates straight to you. Experimental and Stress Test Branches should not see much use for the rest of the year, and will be deprecated until we get to a point they are once again needed. Our goal right now is to focus on addressing issues you guys have been reporting, and on making DayZ fun for our core player base. With this change, we will release one more thing for you guys to play around with: DayZ modding tools. Yes it''s happening! While they can definitely be considered Experimental, your early feedback on the tool set can help us shape the future of the DayZ platform and game alike. Tools will be available as a free download on Steam and will be also supported by our new DayZ Launcher to organize your DayZ experience. The launcher (familiar to those of you who tried Arma 3) will be useful not only to work with mods, but also for work with startup parameters, server and tools after the tools package stabilizes a bit. With the DayZ tools release, we will be opening the Steam Workshop for you guys to share your creations in an easier way, accessible in one central place. TLDR; if nothing goes majorly wrong, 0.63 is moving to Stable tomorrow, and we begin our BETA development - the march towards a stable 1.0 release.  Plans for the upcoming weeks With 0.63 on the Stable Branch, and community server owners updating their servers with all these new features we introduced, I wanted to touch on few more things that are about to happen in the upcoming weeks, as that's certainly something you'll be very curious about. Server browser changes & update schedule The server browser is getting an overhaul based around a new technology that we developed together with our Online Services team. The gain with this implementation is that you'll be better able to tell if a given server is running a modified version of DayZ, and at the same time, the new implementation will make the server browser feel more aligned with rest of our UI design (which is by no means polished yet, but at least a basic direction has been set). Related to community servers, at least for the rest of the year, we're trying to go and have a fixed schedule of weekly updates so that server owners can be ready for any upcoming game updates. Fixing, tweaking, and polishing The upcoming bugfixes and tweaks will be focused on many of your complaints over the years. We read almost everything you guys post across social media, including (especially) those comprehensive lists for 1.0, and I just want say we know these things are important to you. While features are in, their functionality is often broken. We know that's what makes or breaks a game, and now is exactly the time to get that fixed. During this period of stabilization and iteration, you'll see the game change around the details that matter. A balance pass is ahead of us, and while it's certainly not the last, it will definitely be a first one that will fix a whole lot of the inconsistencies you guys experienced over the years. Just as an example, I'm going to use the fix of misaligned guns that is already in Experimental (caused by either using a vehicle, being in prone, or using free-look). We're also going to go over some of the issues that bother you a lot: like hit registration problems, or changing your key binds. Let's go. Feature and content freeze for BETA/1.0 With today's Experimental update, we have released a huge amount of items that were not available in-game before, and while some of their functionality might be bugged, these specific cases will be tackled in the bugfixing, polishing, and balancing push. What's in the Experimental build now is the list of items we want to hit 1.0 with, and anything else we've talked about in the past will be a post 1.0 content released as free platform updates. The same goes for features - features that we previously had planned to deliver and are not in-game right now and are postponed after 1.0 release. We will be working on our post 1.0 plans and communicate the exact details of our efforts through official channels. One thing I can already say - I'm really looking forward to working on a stable game platform. Something we have not seen a lot (or at all) for the past 5 years.  Addressing the current most pressing issues There are some hot topic currently resonating in the community, and I wanted to touch upon some of those in more detail. As these would make the Status Report visually even longer, we're gonna put them into a separate forums post. These are the topics covered: Item renaming Hit registration Changing key binds Bloom post process effect tweaking FPS drops READ THE FORUM POST  Now to an elephant in the room that has to be talked about in a proper manner. Previously, I have said that I want to write up my thoughts after talking to you guys on various channels and criticism that has ensued after the last Status Report. Here it is. Why go for a 1.0 release this year? There were two choices here, either we miss our 1.0 deadline, or we miss content parity. Both are bad no matter how we look at it. I seriously believe for the health of DayZ as a brand, as a game, we have to move in a direction of stable and reliable gameplay. The core DayZ features are already in the game now, and the devil is in the details. We have to make sure those core features work as they should first and foremost. Not only are you missing out on some really cool things in the game because the current implementation of features is simply broken - additionally, we also we have to deal with development on a game platform that is simply not stable enough for us to continue without loosing our minds. Making a new weapon on a game that crashes or stops shooting bullets every day due to low level changes is not fun for us either. We know that this step is not only important for the game, but also for the team here. While we might have put on a version number 0.64 and just continue development as many of you have suggested, we have to start working with deadlines properly and be prepared to prioritize. We could have spent years polishing and adding to what DayZ is, but to do so, we need to start planning better and that requires a platform where estimations on complexity can be relied upon. That is not the case right now. While we agree that content variety is extremely important to DayZ, we can improve upon that that post 1.0. And the same comes with features like helicopters. We are not abandoning DayZ. We're taking a deep breath, we're taking a look back with the aim to properly plan out building on a platform that is fun to develop for. Can you really have a polished, stable 1.0 version of DayZ by the end of the year? There's not much time left. Yes, unless we believed that, we wouldn't have chosen the option to hit the deadline. There is about a month of real development left, and hopefully some you have noticed we have started fixing some really pressing issues in DayZ over the last week as we shuffled our priorities. And that is what deadlines do. They make you think twice about what is really important. While there are large numbers of issues left, only about 600 of them are crucial to make DayZ work as intended. We plan to do exactly that. Fix features, stabilize the game and make it enjoyable after being weighed down by bugs for a very long time. Are you pressured from the Bohemia management to go for the release? There is pressure of course, that's a natural part of game development. We've just spent five years in Early Access. That said, Bohemia Interactive is a privately owned company under no pressure from external investors. It is our decision to meet our deadline, and there are no business people standing behind our backs forcing us to do it. Bohemia is a family of like-minded people who want to make games without publishers calling the shots. It's also one of the core reasons why Bohemia still self-publishes its own games, and generally does things on its own. While we may not be perfect, our players, our community, our games are still very clearly different from the rest of the industry. Why not just continue in BETA after stabilizing the game, and not avoid \"slapping\" a 1.0 on a game that's not \"feature/content complete\"? Because if we were to do every single thing that was ever conceived/thought of/casually mentioned for DayZ, we would not be able to exit Early Access even next year. In development, especially if you work with new technology, there is no proper way to do estimates. You just do them based on your past experiences with different technologies. This a super complex topic and we were unable, and effectively failed to predict the amount of time some these things would take on the new engine. While the possibilities with our own technology are endless in theory, we just can't hit content/features that we wanted or wished for in the time we set for ourselves. That said, we know that the game is going to be tons of fun even when some of your favorite features and content are missing now. Is there any team restructuring going on after the 1.0 release? Are DayZ developers going to be assigned to other teams at Bohemia? No, we are keeping the same resources as we had this year for the year ahead. To be precise, it's 86 people working on DayZ right now. What are your plans for development after BETA? When can we see the remaining features being implemented? As mentioned previously, we want to properly plan out content and features for next year, and focus on timely delivery by having a stable platform that we can build upon. One of the top priorities will definitely be weapons and content variety. As for features implemented post 1.0, we will share more information once the whole team agrees on what exactly we can and will deliver. DayZ is our dream game and we want to make it the best possible experience for developers and players alike. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer Header image by ​Uncuepa.",

        "contents": "In <a href=\"https://dayz.com/blog/status-report-23-october-2018\" target=\"_blank\">today&apos;s status report on the DayZ website</a>, Brand Manager Martin &#x10C;ul&#xE1;k and other members of the team laid out Bohemia&apos;s plans for the remainder of 2018&#x2014;which still include releasing both the beta <em>and </em>the 1.0 version of the game. Today&apos;s post essentially draws a line between the features that will make it into 1.0 and those that will be held until a future update, post-launch. In short, it&apos;s good news if you like building things but bad news if you like throwing things. The beta will include base building, the first iteration of which was quietly added to stress test servers last week, allowing players to tinker with it using the offline editor (some <a href=\"https://dayz.com/blog/community-spotlight-22-october-2018\" target=\"_blank\">nice, cozy examples can be seen here</a>). Bases will include an electricity system and a way to lock other players out. Two vehicles, the V3S truck and the Lada 4x4 will be included, as will modding support, and some fun new character features like growing beards over time (yes!) are also planned for the beta. A few smaller features are listed such as being able to perform melee attacks with guns, a better server browser, and a more extensive in-game map. What&apos;s <em>not </em>going to be included in the beta and 1.0 version is just as noteworthy. And some much-desired features Bohemia had hoped to include this year have been tabled until next year, to be added post-launch. This includes helicopters for players to repair and fly, a system for climbing over obstacles, plus bows, arrows, and throwing items&#x2014;including grenades. Several guns have also been shelved until post-release, including the Magnum, SKS, and Winchester 70.

It is the day before our Status Report, and that means it's time for the Community Spotlight! We released a Stress Test last week and you clearly had some fun with it over the weekend. We didn't announce officially that you can find the first iteration of base building on the servers, because we didn't think it is ready (and no, it isn'''t). But some of you discovered it really quickly and tried their first creations. A small base concept in the offline editor by Lijazos: https://i.imgur.com/5oiz8KW.jpg  Another one by CryDoXz, including a time-lapse video: https://i.imgur.com/skQVa3M.png https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVWUYH-Dm_M And the last one made by JeckRush: https://i.imgur.com/hWg5SM4.jpg It is really nice to see you had a fun on the Stress Test, even though it is very much WIP. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gGkyDaZ3zo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25uAsvQTnW0  TheRealCDiggity has shared a deep truth with the community. He added a comment to this nice picture: Had a great time with these guys before we were brutally attacked by a barbaric madman, they taught me a valuable lesson, that making friends is a lot more fun than attacking randoms with knives and eating them. Don't forget, an empty stomach is not a good political adviser. https://i.imgur.com/g4VqAfm.jpg What is better than calm evening on your farm? mov3ax is really enjoying the rest. https://i.imgur.com/8EeeR1u.png  And I don't want to force my opinion on you, but even in DayZ is the Earth round. mov3ax has a proof! https://i.imgur.com/BxRFCh3.png  We have another amazing screenshot-guy here.

In its wake, we&#8217;ve been introduced to a cavalcade of punishing, persistent environments intent on putting us in an early grave. The masochistic impulse to put ourselves through the wringer for entertainment has spread to RPGs, management games, cosmic sandboxes and more than a few horror games, so even if you don t fancy punching rocks and trees while wandering around in the wilderness, you might still find a survival game to tickle your fancy. <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/10/09/the-20-best-survival-games-on-pc/#more-598031\" class=\"more-link\"> (more&hellip;) </a> ",

We had the first internal multiplayer play-test of vehicles, Eugen is going to tell you more about it. He also talks about the hit registration issue, which is one of our priorities right now. Adam wants to introduce some changes related to gamma abuse, and Boris shows you how to prolong the burning time of torches. Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Boris  Dev Update/Eugen Dear survivors. Let’s start with something that definitely needs addressing. While I’m happy we've released the PC server files, in regards to the both the PC and Xbox versions, there are some serious flaws that we need to look into.  Priority Issues For one, hit registration has been quite a problem recently, and I want to talk about what we know so far. While for most you, it seems like your bullets are not registering when hitting players around you, there might be (and probably are) multiple causes to this behavior. From magazines spawning and having ghost bullets (server and client think there is a different amount), through network messages not being sent, to maybe the armor system working incorrectly on specific items and configurations. We’re looking into different angles. So far, with the use of bots, we are able to reproduce the issue when there are multiple corpses around. It seems like a network issue, so we’re starting with this to eliminate the possible low level cause first. It is also the first course of action because if we can confirm some network messages are not being sent in certain cases, it probably causes much more than incorrect hit registration. We’re still in the process of debugging when exactly it happens and how. But having a sure way to see it in game helps us a lot. So if by any chance you know how you get your character/weapon/magazine/bullets in desynchronized state, please do report that through the Feedback Tracker. The second thing I want to mention today is the inventory implementation on Xbox. We know it needs to get our love and attention. We will soon be reaching out to you and we'll be interested in your feedback. Other than that, we are preparing a patch for the PC Experimental branch, ideally containing the fixes to the hit registration issue, as well as other smaller changes based on your feedback. From log upgrades to the ability to set a Steam query port for ease of DDOS setup when hosting a server, and some more.  Progress towards Experimental BETA We've recently had our first multiplayer playtest of vehicles on the new implementation and the first results are promising. Once we have more to share about the patch, we will do so, both here and other channels. But the current state leaves us with two major, risky features in terms of overall update stability: vehicles and base building. The rest are going through rounds of intense QA testing to make sure we’re not missing something game-breaking. So let’s get back to work and see you in game once we''re ready for further Stress Test. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Adam Nighttime in DayZ should be dark and terrifying. It should force you into using any light source you have available. Having an ability to light up your surroundings should be just as vital as having enough water and food. Shutting off your light should only be required in case of an emergency. Also, when night vision goggles make their way into the game (which is something we still want to do in the future, but not in BETA), they should be a rare, powerful thing that can turn their owners into potential predators, not a laughing stock for people avoiding night-time by turning the night into a day by cranking up a gamma slider (be it through drivers or display settings). The removal of the in-game gamma slider was but a first step towards making the very frequent gamma abuse more complicated to do. In today's status report, I'm going to present another step towards making the night-time a en equal playing field for everyone (at least as much as we're actually able to do that). A survivor scouting Myshkino military camp using flashlight mounted on his AKM, unaware of a danger hidden in a shadow. https://i.imgur.com/1ly8asB.png Please keep in mind that this is still very much experimental feature and we will be tweaking it based on your feedback (once it hits public branches). We have also taken a look on the global light config again (adjusting some dusk and dawn values), boosted up brightness of all available light sources and we will be taking a closer look at the CE setup to make sure there is always enough light sources within the game world. - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Dev Update/Boris Greetings survivors! Lately, there has been some effort invested into improving night gameplay across multiple departments (Adam will share more on that as well). So I'd like to report on one of the contributions I did in this regards, which is a refactor of the craftable torch. Firstly, the torch now contains an attachment slot for rags, which allows players to prolong its burning time by adding more than one rag on it. You can also refill its stock while it's burning, which means you don't have to craft a new torch after running out of fuel for the current one. The latest Experimental branch on Steam already contains this change so you can try this out for yourself. Additionally, in BETA, refueling will be possible to do through a crafting user action without the need to open inventory. As usual, this will be done through a quick bar or an interaction with a relevant item on the ground. https://media.giphy.com/media/tZXHyr3hzLkhfPzpaR/giphy.gif Refueling of a torch 1 Secondly, you'll be able to even further prolong the burning time by coating the torch with animal lard. Such upgrade is mainly useful for base builders, as it allows them to craft a long-lasting source of light that can be placed anywhere without the need of frequent refueling. Using gasoline as fuel is being considered, but currently, it's not implemented yet. https://media.giphy.com/media/XJ1SpeDfI6mDNA8UPA/giphy.gif Refueling of a torch 2 Lastly, the amount of fuel on the torch will be represented by its quantity bar, so you will always know how much time you have left before it goes cold. With these changes, this basic item is more interesting to use while giving it some connections to other activities like hunting, base building and collecting clothes or rags. - Boris Vacula / Scripter Header image by Sp1kerZ.

We were shooting a Dev Log video last Thursday in our motion capture studio in Mníšek pod Brdy. It was a really long day but we are satisfied with the result. I can't promise you when this video will be out, but I have some behind the scenes pictures and a bunch of short Instagram stories on our Instagram account. I've added the stories to our archive, so you can watch them without any limits https://i.imgur.com/1fjAzdj.jpg https://i.imgur.com/vONljkK.jpg I hope all of you know our best screenshot-er DrDeSync. This screenshot looks really creepy, and I am afraid to ask if these guys are friendly. Because I don't think they are. https://i.imgur.com/2FGDxJ9.jpg  Another nice screenshot is made by pizzausfree. Thank you for sharing! https://i.imgur.com/Ljf8nBE.jpg   rumski  called this screenshot \"Dropping Gear and Stuffing Faces Because...Running…\". It is not needed to collect everything you find, man! https://i.imgur.com/qRUAksO.jpg  Meet Michael and the trailer he's living in. It looks like a cozy place! Intruzo posted his experience from a role-play server on Reddit. He said Michael was really friendly and he invited him to his trailer for dinner. I like players like Michael, they make the DayZ experience more interesting for other players. https://i.imgur.com/FDEVEEN.jpg This screenshot comes from the Xbox community. Wilson80121 and his squad are ready to go to Tisy. https://i.imgur.com/yc567wV.jpg  This is a nice edit from kakshiOG called \"Fallout Storm\". Good job! https://i.imgur.com/EVgUfSP.jpg  ZomboCZ really cares about DayZ. He likes to share every detail he can find in the game. Last week, he posted a bunch of new assets from the Experimental branch on Reddit, which he thinks could be interesting for the community. I am going to share it here with you. A train station is now enter-able, you can see all details of the building HERE. https://i.imgur.com/SU9qoRZ.png He also focused on the new R-105 Soviet military radio. If you don't know how it works - you can use it the same way as a regular walkie-talkie, but the voice transmission, so it's very useful for role-players and friendly survivors. https://i.imgur.com/o1b485L.png You maybe don't know it, but we have new fruits on the Experimental branch. You can find plums and pears now. Here are detailed shots from ZomboCZ. https://i.imgur.com/VB8uR1u.png If you still have a problem to find a new fruit, I think this can help you a little. You can find pears under these trees: https://i.imgur.com/Qw7Eohw.jpg And plums here: https://i.imgur.com/mKUdkMG.jpg The first video is by Rene aka BarelyInfected and he gave us a story about hunger. When you are dying of hunger in DayZ, are you going to kill and eat your buddy? It is all about choices. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es73b-jvdPY  This is not a friendly encounter. It is pure PVP action, fast and deadly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=270&v=j4SpBri4XMQ  When you join some server with increased infected spawn, you should expect some trouble. But never give up, man! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJvec8NVshk Check out this great DayZ cinematic by mov3ax! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jecodf-BDoE  This video is probably some part of role-play, I really did not get what happened there, but The Syndicate group isn't friendly at all. A lot of players died in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjC_dGoUHo  Uncuepa is a great buddy from the community and if you know him, you can ask him some questions, because Boydy will record an interview with him. Ask your questions HERE. https://youtu.be/Lh9ZRGcS0Lc  People are fighting over water, food, ammo. But sometimes, the reason to kill is simply just a jacket. Damn, it had to be a really nice jacket though! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF8JqVXO6fc This is also a funny video. Xbox player O_Ambulo_O got trolled by his friend. It is hilarious! Click on the picture for watching: https://i.imgur.com/xtvTL09.jpg Let's talk about modding or game changes you made!  Xxkabalxx is probably working on winter in Chernarus, because he shared a first sound test and I can feel the cold from it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htwzzjqb400  ThePyrotechnic developed a BEC plugin to display the number of players on your server. You could be interested. More info HERE. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/316793437?t=01s  Someone could want more spawn points on his/her server. If you don't know how to do it, here are instructions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zB3NGjgkA0 I know, I know. Everyone already heard about the DayZ Battle Royale mode. We are working on our own Battle Royale mode called the Survivor GameZ, but untill that's ready, you can try this community mode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrOYBS9aBxE And mov3ax is already working on airdrops. What do you think, guys? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgNfK9d2KY  ZiltoidTheHorror doesn't care if we have an auto-run button in-game. Real PC players use coins, matches or papers. Console players are using hair rubber bands. https://i.imgur.com/X1W8oJE.jpg  Yolikus is living in the real Chernarus aka Ústí nad Labem. And this is the view from his flat compared to the game. Awesome, thank you for sharing! https://i.imgur.com/Spw2uwD.jpg https://i.imgur.com/P5uVSVl.jpg And the last part of the Community Spotlight is the location riddle. The small building is located near Gorka: https://i.imgur.com/4UNAeul.png And the winners are: souffiane mechri Lunar Cyril‏ Felix‏ Molly Magoo Tweedy Jonny K Astro  Good work guys, thank you!

Of course, this is not going to happen over night, Eugen will give you an introduction on this. We also have our Leads from the Gameplay Programming, Animation and Sound departments with us to bring you some more detailed information on what's going on behind the scenes of our road to BETA. Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Filip Dev Update/Baty  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, the server files release is now behind us, and I would like to thank all the community members who have patiently waited all the way to this point. We are very happy to see old players coming back to try the new servers popping up. We are aware of the issues currently plaguing the administrators running community servers and your feedback is very much welcomed. We have already deployed a patch with fixes, and there's more coming. We are looking specifically into issues with zombie spawns, logs, configuration and security. Once ready, you will see updates coming directly to the Experimental branch of the game. Now that our Experimental content patch is out in the open, I wanted to talk about the next thing. Some of it has been said previously mentioned in interviews from Gamescom, and I wholeheartedly recommend watching these, as the questions asked by both M1ndr and BarelyInfected have been straight to the point. While there have been some serious delays with the delivery of the first content patch, the work on the internal version of the game has not stopped. This basically means one thing: the next patch arriving to the Stress Test branch will be considered an Experimental BETA and will contain new content and features, including vehicles and base building. We will offer a detailed list of the BETA package later on. The list for both features and content is not exactly short, so we'll need to make make sure everything works. The process for the publishing of this patch will start with Stress Tests focusing on the new content. Currently, we are quite happy about the stability of the internal client and server, and most of the team is focusing on bugfixing. More information on the release will be shared through our official channels, I cant wait for you guys to drive around Chernarus with your friends. Once this patch hits the Experimental branch of the game, it will again be made available with both server and client, and pushed to Xbox as fast as possible. That brings me to our players on Xbox. While we may not seem that active now, we are listening to your feedback and concerns, and we're working on necessary changes and bugfixes plaguing the game. There was a smaller game update pushed earlier today, and whenever possible, we'd love to keep updating at least once a week. The current patch focuses on UI fixes (no major inventory changes yet), server messages and VOIP. This also includes any fixes done to the game on PC. More changes are coming alongside the mentioned BETA patch and features. See you in Chernarus! - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Mirek I have a very brief overview of the features and bugs we are currently working on. Let's take a look:  LODs for the animation system Currently, when playing any animations, the whole skeleton is evaluated (every single bone), no matter how far away from the camera the other entities are. Our new system will improve the client & server performance significantly - especially server-side. Instead of evaluating almost 200 bones, we now need only about 20 or even less to be evaluated on server-side. The evaluation of the entire skeleton currently takes about 75 percent the of AI's simulation time, so we believe this optimization will help to increase AI numbers significantly. Vehicles - physics The gearbox (clutch) simulation and tire friction still need some tweaking, because vehicles still have some issues with riding to hills.  Vehicles - animations / camera We improved the 3rd person camera and added more character animations. This includes handling the clutch, brake & thrust pedals. https://i.imgur.com/HZhBqfH.gif  Vehicles - networking We have reworked the networking logic for 4 wheeled vehicle synchronization (and the same logic will work for future vehicles), the next step is network traffic optimizations. https://i.imgur.com/9XccjLn.gif https://i.imgur.com/CHRfX5N.gif Input system We had to rework the input system a bit, due to requirements to simply add new actions (something the modders among you will appreciate!). Currently, the new system is in testing, adding the key binding options will be the next step.  AI spawns on servers with offline DB This is probably one of the last bugs we want to solve on the current Experimental branch. The rest will be fixed within the Experimental BETA update. A lot of other bug fixes (bugs which we have already fixed on the internal branch) will also be included in the Experimental BETA. This includes fixes for the iron-sights/optics inaccuracy, damage system issues, attachments rendering in inventory and many, many more. - Miroslav Maněna/ Lead Programmer  Dev Update/Viktor Last week, we've had a small motion capture session. This was mainly dedicated to a capture of various missing animations for player character or minor fixes to existing animations. Meanwhile, we were also focusing on bugfixing and polishing of the player actions, vehicle related animations, and item poses. The vehicles now have many advanced animations like switching the lights off and on, using pedals, shifting gears and of course steering. https://i.imgur.com/br0KzKO.jpg https://i.imgur.com/9mt73Te.jpg There are many new things and improvements done on the player animation graph side. One example to speak for all, just recently we have reworked aiming with the flashlight, torch and other items. This was always not very convenient to use because the light was not going in the right direction. From now on though, it works just great! The light beam now aims where you are looking, no matter if the character is standing or moving, so flashlight should be your best friend from now on in dark areas. We have also added a small detail in the form of an animation for switching the flashlight off/on. https://i.imgur.com/ze5UoQP.gif https://i.imgur.com/l5H3R8Y.gif https://i.imgur.com/E80khiY.gif - Viktor Kostík / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Filip Hello everyone. The entire audio team is continuing the work on the overall audio appeal of DayZ, and we've created a range of new and updated game sounds. Let's have a look: new rain sounds for tarmac, tile and wooden roof surfaces updated the rain sounds for trees and bushes updated the leave rustling sounds for bushes new sounds for the \"empty vessel\" and \"pour liquid\" action (pouring water onto the ground or into another vessel) sounds for jump and landing animations new sounds for various items for pick into hands action new sounds for carrying weapons on your shoulder infected play different footsteps (bare feet, sneakers, boots) according to what they are wearing new sounds for eating fruit, cereals and taking pills - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Dev Update/Baty Hey guys, we separated the Community Spotlight and released it yesterday and I hope you liked it.

Each Status Report, I've been collecting some of the community created content that you sent me or that I came across on the internet. From now on, with BETA/1.0 releases and modding support coming up later this year, we'd like to get back to the idea of having Community Spotlight articles published separately (believe it or not, that's how it's been way back!), trying to really put your content into the spotlight and not have it buried at the end of a Status Report (don't worry, we'll still link this article in the Status Report!). For the first edition of this renewed Community Spotlight, I'll most likely stick to the classic format, but try to evolve it over time, making it more interesting to follow! Let's start and see the awesome things you've made over the past couple of weeks! I hope you have noticed we have released the DayZ server files. What does it mean? You can now run your own server on your own hardware and you can configure it how you like it the most. And, of course, you can try some modding! As we said in the forum post, we are not officially supporting modding yet because we don't have all the tools ready, but it doesn't mean you are not allowed to start modding. Actually, exactly the opposite is true! We are looking forward to seeing your work! In fact, there are already some very nice modding projects! Let's open up with trains. Players are crazy about them for years and Arkensor is working on a modification which should bring them to life. He recently shared his first teaser with the community. And it will be HUGE! All aboard the HYPE TRAIN! CHOO CHOO! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aw4-lmONqM Another creation from the community on the way is a new map called Barrandien. It is a map based on the real location in Czech Republic and it is 420 km2 large. Barradien is made by small group of loyal members of the DayZ community from the Czech Republic with a little help from our map designer Sumrak. We are proud of you guys! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiyVMYD9o1c If you are going to check the server list, you can already find some changes. One of the new things are the 100+ slot servers. And some of them are full almost every day and run pretty nice as far as I know. Another change are spawns with gear on specific locations. These servers are for PvP players mostly, because it is something like King of the Hill and it is not easy to survive on these servers. It is really nice to see how the community is playing DayZ in the way every individual player likes it the most. What are you doing on Saturday, 29th of September, at 9PM AST (1AM UTC)? If you are free, Boydy prepared an event with the PIPSI.net server called Manhunt with nice prizes. You can find more information in the video below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnbgE8e3hSw  I want to show you some nice edits by Reddit user EskimoArctic. What do you think guys, aren't they nice? https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/1aa35xtg2nm11.png https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/g2j32l455hm11.png https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/c2vlv1anx2n11.png Another talented editor is called Greenfist. Look at these awesome screenshots he made. Really cool. https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/8ui9nrN.jpg https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/c9msj5ds0km11.jpg And one more screenshot! Nilwick shared his screenshot that looks like a renaissance painting. And yes, it looks really like one. You should share it to r/accidentalrenaissance reddit! https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/qsv4z469dan11.png Someone is really hyped for New York Comic Con! WhiteDeathDayZ‏ sent me a picture of the cosplay he wants to wear to the event and I like it! I am glad we are going to have a true Survivor there! Don't forget to share more pictures from the convention with us! https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnkPxj9U8AAMFPa.jpg:large https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/4458811/6a28ecfa623999e24cfb79031869b53dd74c59fb.jpg Did you know there is a community DayZ podcast? It is called Compass and it is made by Uncuepa and his guests. If you are a podcast fan this is something you would like to hear! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE7w5p0C6Do SepticFalcon, our loyal supporter made a video how the Public Address System works. If you didn't know about it just check out his video. It is really fun with a PA system, you should try it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFgxamf5Ytk And the last thing before the riddle. Bthntn composed a song for DayZ. It is dark and atmospheric, you can listen to it here: https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/2.JPG Let's end with our riddle. Only one person guessed the latest location correctly. It was a player named Bakro. Applause! The place is near Kozlovka at the road to Novoselky. Not Msta, guys. Let''s try again with another riddle prepared by Sumrak. Where is this place located? Send your answer to our Twitter account with the #DayZriddleTime hashtag. https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/20180924165124_1.jpg Have a nice two weeks and see you in Chernarus!

Anyone with sufficient hardware will be able to host their own DayZ server. You are now going to have more customization options and will be able to configure your servers directly. This, of course, goes hand in hand with new opportunities for modding as having access to the server files gives you much more freedom than ever before. It is important to mention, that even though we are thrilled to see what our community can make we are not officially supporting modding yet. Why? Mainly because some parts of the game can change a lot and we are still finishing the modding tools we want to provide to you in the future. That being said we definitely won't stand in the way of your creativity. You can read the documentation and the minimum recommended system requirements here. We believe that these files will help you create the unique server environment you always wanted. See you in Chernarus! Header picture by DrDeSync. ",

Our Lead Gameplay Programmer Mirek is answering community questions on the recent server issues and our animator Adam demonstrates the return of the surrender and restraint systems. Let's dive into it! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Oresten Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, we have some good news to share. The Content Update has hit the Experimental Branch today, and that means we're also making it available to community server owners currently hosting with one of our Game Server Providers (GSPs). Please expect slight delays as GSPs will cope with the number of switch requests, but I'm happy to see things finally move along to the Experimental phase after most of the critical issues were fixed in our Stress Tests. We have implemented a large number of optimizations in our network code while trying to identify an issue that in the end was caused by specific server hardware problems. Now I have something that many of you probably don’t expect yet, but we want to see things move along at a faster pace there so we can get feedback: We've decided to release the DayZ 0.63 Server Files before BETA, and currently, we'd like to make them available to all DayZ players within the next week. Everyone will be able to download the Server Files for free on Steam under the tools section, and from that moment, everyone will be able to host a DayZ server on their own. I think that with the release of Server Files, we will see a much broader variety of server setups and community made game modes and while the full modding tool-set won’t be available before BETA, I think you guys have already figured a lot of the stuff out. Last but not least, our goal with the next Content Update (that we might already call an Experimental BETA patch since we will be stabilizing the internal version of the game on the Stress Test machines) is to have a release in as soon as the next couple of weeks. This update will, again,introduce a variety of new things, with vehicles getting in a bit later after the initial release of this next Content Update. We will announce the new features and content as soon as we release the first Stress Test build. Just to pick one example, the new restraining system that Adam talks about is definitely one of my favourite ones. The Xbox version of the game will see major game updates getting in soon after they hit the PC Experimental branch. While we won't be Stress Testing as of now on the Xbox platform, we will keep churning out updates with bug fixes and stability fixes to this version as they manifest themselves. Even today, we have pushed a game update with lots of fixes for bugs that we have seen in the PC version, and most importantly, we're fixing some of the specific inventory issues and controller related bugs that will make DayZ a better, more enjoyable experience on Xbox. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Mirek Hello survivors. For the last couple of weeks we were releasing new Stress Test builds almost every day with the goal to improve server performance and to finally solve the BattlEye mass kicking. And we solved it! I'd like to describe here what we were doing and why Stress Tests are so important for us. Probably the best way how to explain what we were doing in our last Stress Tests is to answer some questions directly from the community. Let's go through the questions that TheMagicTorch asked on Reddit, as they will nicely demonstrate our thought process. Q: Are you working with BattlEye developers to try and resolve the issues? A: We do have a direct communication open with BattlEye developers, and the first thing we've made was that we asked them for some input on what could be wrong. In any case, the kicking issue was there even when we disabled BattlEye, so logically, we started looking for an issue on our end. Q: What do you think is causing the kicking? In technical terms. So we knew that the issue is on our side, we were sure it must be somewhere in the low level part of our networking - we were thinking that the issue must have something to do with packet ordering or re-sending of lost packets, or even with serial numbers of packets. Now we know it was caused by packet fragmentation - in some rare cases, some packets were dropped and it broke down the entire server. Q: Why are you finding it particularly difficult to resolve kicks and lag? Are the kicks and lag a result of lots of bugs that you're slowly working through, or are you still trying to identify where problems are? The source of the kicks was just one mistake in the code, but it was hard to find it, since we weren't able to reproduce it internally. The 0.63 branch was created almost 2 years ago and a lot of changes have been made during this time period. Two weeks ago, we started to revert these changes, because it was probably the fastest way (but not the easiest one) how to find the source of the issue. We have reverted one or two improvements every day, made a build and released it on the Stress Test servers, so basically we went back in time every day (the curiosity here is that this bug has been in the build since May 2016). When we've identified the source of the issue, we started putting the reverted and working stuff back into the branch, and released it in Stress Test #46. Lags are closely connected to the server performance, so different parts of the code may cause them. We were profiling the servers every day to find out the source of performance drops, or what exactly takes most of the CPU time. Every day, we've made some improvements, which were merged into the Stress Test branch for play-testing. It's important to test these optimizations because optimizations can often break things that were previously working fine. One optimization helped us to find out that there is an issue with the firearm damage sanity check, which caused bad hit registration. This bug was there the whole time, but after the optimization, it happened more often. Q: Why does performance seem to vary between region? The deployment team along with Eugen has tracked this issue down to be a problem with a hardware configuration of the servers, and we're now seeing consistently decent server performance across regions. - Miroslav Maněna/ Lead Programmer  Dev Update/Oresten Hey everyone, it's been a while since I wrote something, but boy, have I got goodies today or what? For the last two weeks, I have been working on looking through optics, surrender and restrained states.  Optics The current implementation of looking through a detached optic in the latest public build had a lot of problems with it... The accuracy of mouse-to-screen is sub-par at best, and you can't accurately follow a target without moving your mouse a couple of meters. We discussed various ways to implement a solution, but I was mainly worried about the character not accurately displaying where someone is looking. If we were to ignore the player animation accuracy and just set the camera to be 1:1 with the mouse, other players could think that they haven't been discovered all while the player who's looking through his binoculars could be tracking them. I solved this by not allowing you to move while looking through binoculars or scopes, and by doing this, I eliminated any external factors that could mess with the accuracy of the animation; because really, what kind of crazy person would be moving while looking through a pair of binoculars? One wrong step and you could lose your target entirely! Here's the animation I cooked up: https://i.imgur.com/TY1vlpo.gif As you can see, it's quite damn responsive. Here's how it looks while looking through it: https://i.imgur.com/uaBFV1k.gif It's in a really good state so far and accurately displays in and out of the optics exactly where that person would be looking.  Surrender and restrained Surrender is a highly sought after feature that we have been working on to deliver in the highest possible quality. At first glance, it would look like it's just another gesture; but under the hood it holds a bunch of complexities. You can't access your inventory when you're in surrendering - not something common for gestures. You also have new stance rules where you can only walk while standing and only turn in standing and crouched - also not something gestures can control. Lastly, but not least, it also has a bunch of surrender-specific stance changing animations - also something that gestures cannot control. With these things in mind, we had to approach the surrender mechanic with a bit more caution, as a half-assed approach would probably come back to bite us later down the line. We have solved it by essentially handling it like a gesture state on the script side, but on the animation side, it would be considered an \"item\" of sorts. The reason behind this solution is that when a player puts an item in his hands, his character will switch to the corresponding animation set (picking up a rifle will start playing the rifle animations, pistols for pistols, and so on) with all of their specific animations for turning, changing stances, etc. By putting this \"ghost item\" into the character's hands, the surrender animation set is enabled, and the specific movement rules that that animation set has attached to it. In addition, we have opened up avenues for ourselves where we can have a bunch of surrender-specific animations; such as deaths, gestures, actions, etc, etc. Gestures-in-gestures? Oh boy. https://i.imgur.com/oHeJShT.gifv All of those same rules also apply to the restrained state, but this also means we can accurately show what item is currently restraining you; such as in this case with some locked handcuffs: https://i.imgur.com/HpAcMOM.gifv Maybe down the line, you'd be able to drink face-first from ponds even while restrained to keep yourself hydrated while running from your captors. Who knows! Until next time. - Adam Oresten / Technical Animator  Community Spotlight Hello guys, has it really been two weeks already? It passed quickly with all the community feedback from all of you Xbox and Stress Test players! I want to thank you again for the feedback, it is really important, and it helps the dev team quite a bit. Let's start with a new merchandise on the Bohemia Store.

Of course, the big spotlight is on tomorrow's release on the Xbox Game Preview program. For our PC players our Senior Producer Julien gave a first look at DayZ modding this week. Let's get started! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Martin Dev Update/Julien Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Gamescom is behind us and while it has been pretty physically exhausting, it is great to see all the positive feedback from players who visited us. DayZ was playable on all three platforms, PC, Xbox and PS4, and we've had these stations full almost nonstop. All stations were running the same build of DayZ on Enfusion. It's amazing to see how far we have come in this regard. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3mliPS0mrk We've had a bunch of interesting interviews (check out Baty's part for a sample of those!), answering some tough questions a lot of you guys have had for a while, so I recommend watching these as it is hard to capture the detail in text. And I think we have done a good job communicating our vision, or the given situation in these cases. I hope you find the interviews enjoyable. The Xbox release is happening tomorrow, and Martin will provide some additional details on that. I'll just mention that the Xbox One release shows Enfusion Engine as the future of Bohemia, as a base for what DayZ is right now and the possibility to bring our unique titles to all platforms. It''s a big milestone for us and for Bohemia as a whole. There were always concerns about performance, controls and UI, but I think there is a way to do it right and we will learn what is best together with the Xbox community itself in the Game Preview program. On the topic of the PC Experimental release, we have made some huge progress over the last week with the issues plaguing the Stress Test servers and are planning to increase the numbers available. We are also discussing the switch over to Experimental after last of the issues is fixed. The Internal build and its development have seen a steady amount of features and content come in. And as of now, we are mostly focusing on base building and vehicles. The rest of the features are being reviewed and setting the priority on bugfixes for BETA is in progress. We are well underway to stabilize DayZ as a whole and I'm excited to see it get in good shape in the coming months. It has been a long time coming, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Both in terms of features, getting 0.63 to you guys, the release of server files, and modding. All things are in motion and we are very happy to invite new players into the game as well as welcome the old ones back. The growth of our community both on PC and Xbox feels almost imminent and I can't be more excited about things to come! - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter Gamescom 2018, same as in the previous year, was an amazing experience. It's been great to meet fans and community members there in person. For me, it’s really refreshing to talk with you about the past, present and future of DayZ. I’m very happy to see that you are so eager and love DayZ so much. It’s motivational, which leads to a great psychic upbeat and spikes of positive energy. Last but not least, I want to welcome all the Xbox One survivors into the world of DayZ. I’m excited that the next huge group of players will be able to enjoy such a unique experience which hardly can be witnessed anywhere else. Be careful out there, it can be harsh... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespešný / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Martin Hello Survivors! The past two weeks have been among the busiest this year, and that's because we've all been handling three major things at once: the PC content update, Gamescom, and the Xbox Game Preview announcement! As Eugen covered the PC part, I'll go ahead and give you a little bit of a behind the scenes from our Gamescom preparations, and update you on the state of the Xbox version of DayZ! DayZ at Gamescom Besides our own Gamescom booth, we've expanded our presence at Gamescom a little bit more this year. Thanks to our friends at Xbox, we've been invited to the Inside Xbox show to announce the release date of DayZ on Xbox one - and we've made a nice little teaser trailer to go along with that! A first one since the initial Early Access release! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er4nVkCYBq0 We've only had a very short time for the production of the teaser (about 2 weeks of time, which is absolutely bonkers), and I'd like to recognize the work of Bohemia Interactive's Multimedia department that managed to set us up with a nice video in what was a truly killer deadline! It was very much a team effort, but my hat is off to Vladimir Jaske for the great editing work, Ivo Struzinsky for game capture and the work on our camera tools, and Jan Dusek for quickly editing together a really nice sounding DayZ track (the one at the very end) with our external composer Nick Fox. I can only say the teaser got people properly excited, and I can't wait to start the production on a new video for the 1.0 release! As we've set the tradition with Gamescom last year, along with our developers, we always bring a very decent amount of free merch to our booth. It's something that we do very differently compared to most of the gaming booths, as we make sure that visiting us is actually a rewarding experience that allows you to meet with the developers you know from online channels, and sets you up with cool swag on top of that. Gamescom is a very exhausting undertaking for the team, but this personal aspect makes it worth the hassle! DayZ on Xbox: known issues and release details With the release date for the Xbox Game Preview announced, the teams back home started preparing themselves for August 29! The first step was letting all of the 5000 people with keys into the Closed Preview of DayZ. I'll admit, we've originally planned to do that sooner, and everyone freaked out quite a bit when our servers behaved in all the wrong ways at the beginning of the last week, but thanks to the massive effort done by our dev team, we've managed to get the situation resolved and get people to play. Looking at the feedback we're getting, there is a set of most common issues we have with DayZ on Xbox right now: Crashes of the game upon loading The inventory behaving in all sorts of weird ways (items not getting picked up, players being unable to fill in all inventory slots etc.) General issues when interacting with items in your hands slot (especially fireplaces, guns/magazines) Status icons invisible on some screens due to wrong UI scaling / cropping near the borders of the screen Hits sometimes not being registered when firing a weapon I want to thank everyone for reporting the issues - be it over the Feedback Tracker, social media, or private conversations. We are aware of most of the annoying issues, and while our priority is now set on applying last minute fixes for server stability and client crashes, we'll look into the remaining critical issues right after the Game Preview release on August 29! As our Inside Xbox announcement was really only focused on the release date, many questions were raised on our social media. Here's the answers to some of the most common ones: How much will DayZ cost on Xbox One? DayZ will be using a standard premium game model (so no free to play, or any in-game monetisation) during the Xbox Game preview, and it will be available for 39,99 USD. You can check your local price when the product page becomes available on the Microsoft Store. The price of DayZ will increase with the release out of Game Preview - the final version of DayZ will be available for 49,99 USD across all platforms. At what time exactly will you release DayZ on 29th? DayZ will unlock at 7PM CEST on August 29. You can use this tool to check your local time for the release. Is there going to be a trial version available? Yes! You will be able to enjoy one hour of free playtime that you can use if you're not sure about the purchase yet. The trial version will run on its own servers, and will not have character persistence (meaning that your character progress will not save during your first hour, and will not transfer into the full Game Preview! How many servers will be available for the launch? As many as needed! We have a good, scale-able setup that will always run enough servers for everyone to join, there will not be a fixed number of servers available. We'll also have teams monitoring the server status 24/7 in the first days after the release to make sure everything goes smoothly! Do you expect people to provide feedback? Yes! We want to get all the feedback - you can use our Feedback Tracker, the official forums, or even our social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, or Discord! Can players start their own private servers on Xbox? Not right now, but we definitely want to have that option in DayZ later on. Are there cars and helicopters on Xbox? No, not right now, but before leaving Game Preview, we'd like to have both on Xbox One. Especially cars play an important role in the DayZ gameplay! That's all for now - starting with the Game Preview release, I'd like to kick off Status Reports that focus on DayZ on Xbox, so look forward to those! It's crazy that the Xbox release is in less than 24 hours from now - so many new Survivors coming to DayZ! We'll see you all in Chernarus! - Martin Čulák / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Julien For those of you who missed our first look at DayZ modding, let me briefly introduce myself: I'm Julien, Senior Producer at Bohemia Interactive, taking care of the modding component of DayZ.  Summary of announced DayZ modding plans so far As said in the blog post linked above, with the DayZ BETA closing in, we’re starting to share some information around modding. At the moment, it is projected to be a PC exclusive feature, integrated via the Steam Workshop. It will work in a pretty similar way to how it does with Arma 3. In last week’s announcement we already mentioned, that DayZ is a hybrid between the RV and the Enfusion engines. While the packing and the asset creation are mostly unchanged and will go through the same process as for Arma 3, the rest (script, particles, animations, UI etc.) will be handled via the Workbench, which is a powerful all-in-one tool developed to handle everything Enfusion related. We invite the most curious among you to read the full announcement or join the discussion - we have already received some interesting questions, which I answered. https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/jules_modding_01_workbench_01_f.jpg  How to talk about your existing DayZ modding experiments We know that some of you have already started digging through the data available in 0.63, and the first DayZ mods are already being made. We'd like to make all modders aware that if you want to start experimenting and share your progress on your creations, you should feel free to do so - and the modding section of our official forums is a great place to do that! We are eager to discover what you’ve been up to these past weeks! However, please, do keep in mind that DayZ is still in active development, which means anything can change any time; e.g. scripted classes, some 3D models or textures (and anything else) might be heavily altered or simply disappear in between updates, impacting your mods. Also, we would like to ask you to not release any of your modifications publicly before the official start of modding.  General timeline for DayZ modding As for when modding will be available: we aim for a partial release together with BETA. However, this is not set in stone. While the initial release of the tools is still unclear, server owners will be happy to know that the server files package should be made available to everyone during BETA on PC at the latest. That's all for now - I'll keep you up to date on our forums! - Julien Vida / Senior Producer  Community Spotlight Hello guys, we are back from Gamescom and it really was crazy. Our booth was massive this year, we had there 10 computers, 10 Xboxes and 5 PlayStations with DayZ, and our booth was full most of the time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_uMDtX2k0Y https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/_MG_8419.jpg https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/_MG_8689.jpg https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/_MG_8632.jpg https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/_MG_8610.jpg https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/_MG_8599.jpg  You were such nice guys and you liked the game. It means the world to us. https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/loveyou.JPG  We organized a community meet up on Friday and I am so sorry I couldn't be there. There we so many of you, it is really nice how many of you wanted to meet us. Thank you for stopping by! https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/DlYOS3aXsAAgrb9.jpg  Our photo wall was a huge success. Just try to search #Gamescom2018 and #DayZ on Twitter or Instagram, you can find there so many survivors who took a photo with some gear: https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/survivors.JPG https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/peter.JPG https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/chaoscrew.JPG https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/duha.JPG  And I have three videos for you today: Our favourite content creator Rene aka BarelyInfectedvisited us at our booth to ask Peter Nespešný and Eugen Harton some questions about DayZ development and the future. And here are their answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7runsT14w https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-gvu3Yw3fI  And something different right now. This is a story of a group called River Boys, full of adventure, friendship and fun until the server restart separated them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__xEFndQXCY  That is all from me, thank you again for stopping by at our booth and see you in two weeks! - Baty / Community Manager  Header image by ExacoMvm.

To start things off, our Lead Producer Eugen provides an update on the current state of the first content update, as well as our plans moving forward. Our leads from gameplay programming, animation and sound give a quick recap of their past two weeks of work. We close the Status Report with our Community Spotlight. Let's get into it! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, although the struggle with the server performance is ongoing, we're seeing some good results overall in our goals. We have implemented multiple optimizations during our Stress Test period and there are more coming. Right now, we are seeing some unintended behavior in the multi-core server environment, and that's our current focus. Running servers on a single core, we're experiencing a large upswing in the server FPS that should, in theory, be even more noticeable in a multi-core configuration, but unfortunately, that is not the case now. Some of these issues are quite complex, so we will be tweaking the server code base even more. The first content patch is in an okay state, but we're still not happy with the overall performance. As far as content goes, that seems to be received well, and I'm happy to see people enjoying the returning features and flavor that was added to them. Once we're happy with the performance itself, we will move the build over to the Experimental branch of the game and make the build available to the servers owners in our community. We know it has been a long time and the community has suffered because of it, but if we work together, we can make this dream game of ours a reality. Besides the development of the first content patch, there is a lot of ongoing work put into other BETA features. On Friday last week, we have concluded the primary feature development and the Internal build seems to be in a good place feature-wise. The focus has shifted to bug fixing. There are more than 2000 fixes to get through and we want to make sure we get them done! We will share more details about the next patch after Gamescom. I know some of you are worried about missing features or content. Over the last few years, there have been many features designed, and an insane amount of content created both externally and internally. Some of these things make DayZ better as a game and simulation. Some of them can be considered more or less an added flavor, or even clutter in the overall vision of what the game should be. DayZ needs to be fun first and foremost. It needs to meet your expectations in behavior, stability, and balance. It also needs features that support the player interaction and empower players who want to invest time into learning the details and intricacies of the simulation itself. We read everything you guys say. This is a game made by gamers and for gamers. We want to enjoy the game with you and even though the struggle is sometimes real, all of us want the game to succeed the same way you do. When we have any details to share beyond what has already been stated in the goals for the Beta release, we will do so on all of our channels. Some of you might have noticed an increased commotion around the Xbox version of the game. What we are testing now is the same version that you're seeing on PC Stress Tests. We're making sure it runs well and provides a gameplay experience that feels good on a controller, and shows good performance. The benefits of the performance work we have done are already enjoyed by a smaller group of players that already have access to the Closed Preview, but there are so many players out there that have been with DayZ for a long time and even more who haven't had a chance to try this unique experience. One of the benefits of utilizing modules of the Enfusion engine is being able to have a game like DayZ running on a console. We always want to grow the DayZ community, and it's important not to forget about other platforms. I'll be at Gamescom this year talking about what we will be seeing in the near future and what our goals are before we reach 1.0. I can't wait to share more with you as there are exciting times ahead of us. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter What would DayZ be without the possibility to restrain others and put them into captivity! Now you can also restrain yourself if you would like to plot some twist - of course you will be able to struggle free if something goes wrong. While the character has his hands restrained, his inventory is blocked as well as his quick-slots. However, his inventory is accessible by other players through the vicinity part of inventory screen. https://media.giphy.com/media/OO2J5QpwGnTTYsNmmV/giphy.gif We are also working on the implementation of continuous interactions with objects in the environment. It will allow us to broaden possible interactions, like taking items directly into hands (or swapping them), slowly opening doors, seamless drinking from wells or switching channels on the radio transmitter laying on the ground. Speaking of items on the ground, there is a comeback of dropping items from hands to the ground directly in the world (of course the 'take' animation displayed instead of the 'drop' animation in the GIF is a placeholder). The next step will be a shortcut for putting an item from your hands to the inventory cargo even without it being assigned to a quick-slot, as we would like to minimize any unnecessary access of the inventory. https://media.giphy.com/media/NQ23rqTPGLtwsJWvzg/giphy.gif The work on firearms is still ongoing as well. The support for the new weapon (and items) swapping animation is being implemented, after which there will be a possibility to add independent shoulders. Recently, the long awaited leaning has been reintroduced in it’s basic form (as it was in 0.62 version). However, we would like to make it more prominent and useful for gameplay later. Weapon inertia was missing as well until now and its new implementation is portrayed as sight misalignment. Its degree depends on rotation speed, a nice side effect to it is a parallax shift in the new 3D scopes. You can see them presented in Mirek’s portion of Status Report below. As the latest addition to the pack, welcome the first implementation of lifting weapons in front of obstacles. This mechanic will prevent firearms from clipping through objects geometry, may it be walls, infected or other characters. Don't worry about self defense, as in these cases you will be still able to use a melee attack with your firearm. The lifting at obstacles takes various firearms lengths and their muzzle attachments too into account . https://media.giphy.com/media/vy0fWoWIDb7VBKxPhk/giphy.gif Also, progress on firearms malfunction was recently resumed and unjamming support is being added to all the firearms which will be available in 0.63 version of DayZ. Type of malfunction used is 'failure to eject' which causing mechanism to jam where next round fails to feed. https://media.giphy.com/media/iDJmLvnnOua9OEi4SP/giphy.gif Chance of malfunction is directly proportional to condition of the firearm. In case the firearm is fed from detachable magazines, chance of its malfunction is combined with condition of used magazine. Firearms and magazines condition can be repaired, making weapon cleaning kit a valuable and important item. With firearm malfunction in, I’m looking forward to see all that interesting situation which will emerge during the heat of firefights. Better stock up on weapon cleaning kits... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek For the last couple of weeks and for the next weeks, the major tasks for our gameplay programmers are server-side optimizations, bugfixing for features and content and the implementation of core systems to support new gameplay features, which can then be tweaked by designers. Optimisations We have found a bug, which has been in the game for more than two years but was finally visible after the introduction of ambient loot. This bug was tied to the game entity deletion and caused massive performance drops. We are also preparing optimisations for the Central Economy process, which should be done in a few days time. Gameplay features Vehicles - probably the biggest and most complex feature we're now working on is vehicles. Almost everything had to be rewritten (including character parts), in order to be able to add additional vehicle-related features more easily in the future. Viktor already showcases some progress two weeks ago and I'm sure we will show you more in a couple weeks. Leaning - We've reintroduced a very basic implementation of leaning. The first iteration is in the game and now we have to polish things like animations, camera, and probably more. Check out this first teaser here: https://media.giphy.com/media/woBHcBG5jCndz6hTNg/giphy.gif Weapon changing - We have implemented a basic system for the changing of weapons. For now, we are supporting only firearms, but the rest is on the way. https://media.giphy.com/media/fnsaQLg2XL1hFVfQdA/giphy.gif Sights misalignment - Which means weapon inertia in iron sights and scope. Now, only a few parameters have to be tweaked in order to achieve the best gameplay experience with this feature. https://media.giphy.com/media/7zMGDcZXDazJxTUxNI/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/9LWanMYPBesX8iteG5/giphy.gif - Miroslav Maněna/ Lead Programmer  Dev Update/Viktor Over the last weeks, we've been creating and implementing new attack animations for the infected. That's light, heavy and running attacks with individual arms to get some variation into the PvE encounters. For the player character, we've started the implementation of basic facial expressions during combat-actions. We've also implemented multiple improvements for the idle character animations, like blinking, exhaustion and new idle movements in general. Apart from that, the team has been working on placing and deployment animations that will be used while handling cars, during base building, or when placing traps. All of this comes with numerous fixes to our player animations and the animation graph. - Viktor Kostík / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Filip Čenžák Our audio team went on a trip across our offices and beyond to record some footage for the reintroduction of vehicles. The results are new engine sounds, as well as tire sounds for different surfaces. When it comes to shooting, we will bring back an Arma feature of the shooting controller, which silences insects and birds for a while after a gun is fired. To add to the infected, we've implemented and improved several of their animation sounds with steps and rustling clothing during three different states: idle, running and climbing. Here you are some pictures from our tires and engine recording: https://i.imgur.com/mUqEwkQ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/g9yGWN2.jpg https://i.imgur.com/H50AnYo.jpg https://i.imgur.com/lQl9LYA.jpg https://i.imgur.com/4qgNmlE.jpg - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello guys, It's here, finally! Gamescom time! Bohemia Interactive is going to have a large booth with at Gamescom - with DayZ on PC and on consoles too (both Xbox and PlayStation!), so you can play on whatever platform you prefer, meet the devs and get some merch of course. We prepared a photobooth where you can take some cool DayZ-styled photos. You can try and wear a Gorka uniform, Ushanka, Zmijovka, guns, baseball bat, the Taloon backpack, High capacity vest, Ghillie and more gear from DayZ. So if you're at Gamescom next week, don't forget to stop by in our booth D042 in the Hall 10.1, we are going to be there from Tuesday to Saturday - you have a lot of time to visit us! https://i.imgur.com/3SSJL44.jpg  That is all from me and now is your time!

To start things off, Eugen is talking about the long-awaited content update for 0.63. Next, our Brand Manager Martin Culak will finally reveal some information on how we intend to deliver on our promise to bring DayZ to our fans on Xbox this year. Peter is talking about the introduction of scopes, the continuing debate of \"Aimgate\" and shotguns. Plus, there's a first glance at the return of vehicles. So, buckle up, and let's dive into it.  Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Martin Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, let's talk about the hot topics first. The content patch -while delayed- is shaping up nicely. During the extra weeks spent on the stabilization of its features, we have solved quite a large number of issues, while the main three that were blocking the release are confirmed to be fixed as well. Three main reasons that the patch has not been released sooner are : 1. Client Freezes (Happening in random intervals causing 10+ seconds of no response whatsoever) The issue manifested itself in specific situations and actions of multiple players in a single bubble. We have found the cause and were able to confirm last week that it's no longer happening. 2. Stability issues (Crashes, VME and asserts on the branch) While important, these are definitely considered less damaging on the whole gameplay experience. However, we should be good to go! 3. Scopes During the implementation we have come across a large number of issues from animations, clipping, shaking and more that needed to be solved. Now that we have talked about these, I wanted to confirm that the content patch is getting released on the Stress Test branch tomorrow and that it will be focused on Player vs Player interaction. During this period we might try to raise the player numbers per shard and see where the additional optimizations can take us. After the Stress Test period is over, we will port the patch over to Experimental and enable the switch to do the same for server owners. I'm looking forward to the vanilla experience as there is so much more to explore with these new features. While all this was happening the team was working on the BETA features. We're running several work groups focused on important parts of DayZ, specifically weapons, infected, vehicles and actions. As of now, the general production is running two weeks behind and we are ready to get back on track. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Martin Survivors! I've got a couple of great news to share with you all! There's something with DayZ on Xbox that caused some surprises and confusions, so let me start with that!  DayZ on Xbox - The road to Xbox Game Preview begins! The rumors are right! Our guys in Bratislava and Prague have managed to get the first series of builds through the Xbox certification process, and have already made them available for preliminary testing to a closed group of players enlisted in the Xbox Insider Program (basically a community of super hardcore Xbox One players and fans, as well as Xbox employees). While this is truly a smaller-scale test with only a handful of servers running, it's hard to hide our own excitement, as this is the first time we've let anyone outside of the office play the \"full\" DayZ experience on a console!  For obvious reasons, this also translated into a lot of excitement (and outrage) in the DayZ community, so it's time to share some update on where we are with DayZ on Xbox. Current State of DayZ on Xbox The first important thing to say is that the build that some of the Xbox Insiders are playing is pretty much on par with our current 0.63 build for PC, and shares the same features and content. The way our development pipelines are set allows for most of the progress with PC development to beimmediately used in the Xbox build, and since we've recently done quite a lot on that front, the Xbox version is already well playable. This will only get better as soon as the 0.63 content patch goes out on the Stress Test Branch. Of course, if it was all sunshine and roses, we'd probably just release the thing already, so unsurprisingly, there's a catch. A few of them, actually: we're still applying some minor changes to the controls scheme we're getting our server infrastructure ready we're awaiting fixes for some Xbox specific issues (UI, some user actions missing etc.) Despite these issues, the progress with PC builds, and some platform specific optimisations already bring a good enough gameplay to Xbox, along with a generally very good client and server performance, so as soon as we get ahead of the listed issues (and as long as there aren't new ones appearing), we will proceed to the next step! Closed Preview If you've been following our friends from the Vigor team (they have released Vigor into Game Preview just yesterday, go check that out!), you'll get a decent idea about what that next step is going to be for DayZ - a Closed Preview. Ultimately, that's where we'll get together a bunch of the most excited Xbox Survivors among you, and give you a chance to secure access to pre-release builds of DayZ. In return, we'll ask you to provide us with feedback on your experience, and we'll also use the traffic created on our servers to further evaluate the performance there. Even in the Closed Preview phase, we're probably not going to be ready for any large scale testing, so we'll pick our first bunch of Survivors very carefully, and try to involve some content creators at Mixer and Twitch to spread the excitement for others waiting to get their hands on DayZ. We should get to that part rather quickly though, so be prepared! For Xbox fans around you, also one more clarification: we're currently not planning on expanding the Xbox Insider build to further rings, so the Closed Preview will be your only chance to get some early hands-on time with DayZ! Game Preview We're probably a bit further away from the last step - releasing DayZ for everyone in the \"Xbox Early Access program\", the Xbox Game Preview. As we've been saying at press events over the past months, we'd like to bring DayZ to Xbox Game Preview at the end of this summer, and currently, it looks like we should be able to deliver. For the final confirmation though, we still need things to settle down a bit more, so your best bet is to wait for Gamescom (starting August 21, more on that below!) - by then, things should be more clear, and it's also a good opportunity for any release date announcements, so please cross your fingers that everything works out just fine! As with any Game Preview title on Xbox, there will be a trial version available that'll help you decide whether DayZ is already a fun game to you in its current state. We're considering the trial to be limited to one hour of gameplay. https://i.imgur.com/mPRBsog.jpg I'd like to clarify one important thing - the general timing of the Xbox One release. Up until now, we've been counting on releasing the Xbox Game Preview shortly after DayZ hits BETA on PC. Since we're able to come up with Xbox version of our PC content rather quickly, and we're also enjoying tremendous support from Microsoft, we'll probably take a turn on that position. If things keep going well, we may see an Xbox Game Preview release happening before the PC BETA. And as a last bit: I know some of you are worried about this entire console thing slowing down the PC development. We've already said that on a couple of occasions, but let me repeat this again - our primary development, where most of the work is happening on daily basis, is the PC version, and that's where any progress with Xbox builds always comes from. While we have certainly grown beyond just having 2 programmers working on things related to Xbox releases, our primary focus is, and will remain on developing the PC builds. I may let Peter expand on that, but also the overall game design vision of DayZ has never been changed or strongly influenced by the fact that DayZ will eventually be released on consoles. Even in Game Preview, and later on on PS4, DayZ will remain a hardcore, authentic survival game.   We're going to Gamescom (and maybe, just maybe to PAX West and Australia) Brief update on upcoming events: we'll be at Gamescom again, yay! Gamescom is taking place between August 21 - 25, and we're bringing a much bigger team this year, with all the usual suspects (Baty, Eugen, Peter, Dan), and a very welcome addition of our Senior Map Designer Adam! Altogether, there will be 11 DayZ developers at the event (including our new Community Managers - Tim and Bestius), ready to meet you all and show you the game on all three platforms - PC, Xbox One AND PlayStation 4 (yes, that would be a premiere!). We're also doing our best to answer the many invitations (yes, that's you too, Boydy!) and arrange at least a brief visit of PAX West in Seattle, and PAX Australia in Melbourne. We'll keep you updated! That's all for today - see you at Gamescom, Survivors! - Martin Čulák / Brand Manager  Dev Update/Peter As mentioned in our last Status Report, when it comes to firearms we are focused mainly on the scopes right now. In the following GIF you can see the new PSO 1 scope in action together with the new post processes. Aiming down the sights uses depth of field to blur the firearm while keeping the front sight focused. The scoped-in view is using a circular mask to blur the surroundings and creates spherical distortion to make the magnification effect more prominent. https://media.giphy.com/media/1BFVoSEH3kc2TGOvKq/giphy.gif The next GIF shows how the combination of ADS and scope is operated in a case where such possibility of firearm and scope allows it. The last mode used for precise aiming (sights or scope) is remembered and the next time the aiming action is called it switches right into it. https://media.giphy.com/media/AiyXJuYapRS1jkgGeE/giphy.gif Regarding point shooting (not precise aiming, in other words hipfire from raise), there was sway applied from the very first implementation. However, it used the same strength as in ADS which isn’t enough for such a situation. It lead to the belief that the projectiles are always landing in the exact center of the screen. Now, we have a multiplier for sway implemented, to make it harder to hit targets further away. On the screenshot below, the left target was fired at with point shooting, the right target was fired at with ADS, both using a pistol at 25 meters. You see the results displayed by the trajectory lines and their bullet impacts. https://i.imgur.com/cHMb3Wr.jpg By the way, due to the controversy revolving around \"Aimgate\", it’s also a common belief now, that the projectile direction when fired while point shooting is drastically bend, which isn’t the case. The angle is getting smaller with larger distances. You can see two lines on the following screenshot, the white line is the direction from the camera, the orange line shows the actual direction at which the projectile was fired. Using the 3PP camera, which has the largest offset from the axis of the weapon barrel and with the target in a distance of 10 meters, the angle between the direction of the gun barrel and the fired projectile is around 2 degrees. And to display even this minimal change in projectile direction to the players, we plan to have the weapon visually realigned towards the center of the screen. https://i.imgur.com/K9ZI4no.jpg Last but not least, alongside with the implementation of the pump-action shotgun in the new weapon system, we found what was wrong with buckshots all the time. After a rewrite, buckshots are now spawning the set amount of independent projectiles which are getting dispersed with distance and can penetrate materials. https://media.giphy.com/media/9JnPkr8kc6qZIDfeRI/giphy.gif I’m excited this change will make shotguns finally valuable and deadly - exactly how you would expect. Come get some... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Viktor In the past two weeks our animators have been working on: vehicles: steering wheel poses so the character can steer the wheel nicely. This includes animations like starting the vehicle, adjustments of enter/exit animations and idles. Please be aware that everything you see here is still WIP and subject to change: Getting into V3S Starting V3S Turning Jumping out of the vehicle / Getting back in surrender/restrained: implementation and missing animations hit reactions for crouch and prone for when player character gets hit bugfixing related to firearms - Viktor Kostík / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Filip Čenžák Just a very brief update from the audio team: new reload sounds for the MP133 new sounds for falling trees and bushes (after hack tree and bush action) shooting controller for ambient sounds. Birds and insects go quiet for a while after shooting Coast ambience is positional now. You hear the ambience from the direction where the coast is. Sound Occlusion for gun shots. Gun shots are attenuated if there is any obstacle (like wall or structure) between the shooter and listener - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hi guys, I would like to dedicate my first post to server admins. As development towards BETA is progressing, and more players are interested in permanently playing on 0.63 Experimental, we want to extend our communication when it comes to server owners and communities. We know how much time, passion and resources go into the proper management of a DayZ server, and with the upcoming changes we want to keep you in a better loop on what's coming next. This information starts with the upcoming optional switch for community servers from 0.62 Stable to 0.63 Experimental and will continue covering further changes that will affect server management. Please be aware that we are not talking about access to \"exclusive information\" or a \"direct line\" to the development team. This newsletter will be designed to keep interested server owners informed about all changes and events coming to the very backbone of our community. If you are a server owner, you can register HERE for the newsletter. Sometimes I am very surprised how the community can help each other. For example XAMpew, who wants to help all poor lost survivors with an interactive online map of 0.63 that is currently on the Experimental branch. It is still not ready, but he has done a good job so far. Thank you XAMpew! You can find the map HERE. We have already received several packages from you. Blue and Quennie sent us a teddy bear, Boydy a big bunch of Australian goodies, but one day there were seven boxes full of scotch beer in our office and we were pretty surprised! We would like to thank you Spaggie again because you made us come together in the evening and just talk about other things than just work after a long time. After all, we are not only colleagues but also friends. https://i.imgur.com/0BJub8K.jpgg I would like to introduce you to these two players who love to make wallpapers and screenshots. One of them is Harold Palmer, who has been supplying us with his great screenshots for years and he has his own web page. Check out his work HERE. https://i.imgur.com/GEmKVZu.jpg  The second player is called Squad Crow and Chernarus is so beautiful through his eyes. You can find his work HERE. https://i.imgur.com/ZuCsSQs.jpg  Let me introduce you MrOG, the streamer who is known (besides for his fear of wolves) as an excellent sniper. And if I didn't add his clips to this Status Report he is going to snipe me too. https://clips.twitch.tv/AnnoyingWanderingClintPermaSmug https://clips.twitch.tv/SuperIronicFriseeHassaanChop IS DAYZ TRASH? This question has been asked by Polish streamer TopeREC in this video. Okey, it is just a click bait header but the video is hilarious. Check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMmTbCeJWk SepticFalcon started a new series called \"How To Survive DayZ 0.63 & Beyond!\" and it is really handy for new players of 0.63. So if you are a 0.63 newbie, check it out, it is worth it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVGIDMJy7-Q I want to show you a picture of a bug we found during our internal testing. I am not an expert but I am sure this is not the way how to aim correctly with a weapon. https://i.imgur.com/H6SXzox.jpg And it is time for another riddle! I found only three correct answers this time: Matt MisterrKain Andi Carpenter Here is the location: https://i.imgur.com/2soaEz1.jpg And here is a new one. Where is it located? Send an answer to our Twitter account with the #DayZriddleTime hashtag. https://i.imgur.com/XtY42Ev.jpg And this is all from me, see you in two weeks, Survivors!

To start today's report off, Eugen is going to talk us through the remaining issue of the week as well as last weeks challenges for the team. Our leads from animation, sound and map design share a few insights on their past work. We close everything with our beloved Community Spotlight. Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, it's been quite busy around the office in the last two weeks, and there is a lot to talk about in general. I wanted to cover a couple of topics: the first content update for 0.63, and issues you have been experiencing in the past few days.  Database issues with 0.62 The problem with the legacy 0.62 Stable branch had manifested in two different ways: a) an infinite spawn timer b) by loading a wrong character During the last maintenance, we switched to a temporary database to figure out a solution, making sure the issue does not repeat in the future. Since then we have identified the culprit, fixed it and will be moving back to the Stable hive during our next regular maintenance tomorrow morning. Most of you will be getting your old characters back as the data itself has not been tampered with.  Blue Screen of Death crash issues This issue was quite rampant - luckily, we managed to get it identified and fixed in a patch released last week. The problem was caused by an interaction of multiple external factors that we have since looked into and found a workaround that will keep us stable going forward.  New content and features for 0.63 I'm happy to say that we no longer track any major gameplay issues with the upcoming 0.63 update there were assigned a priority of blocker/critical. There is a number of issues being tracked, and on schedule to get fixed, but most (if not almost all) of them can be described as visual glitches. As of now, the patch is scheduled for a large internal playtest tomorrow and if we don't run into any more issues, we will release the update on the Stress Test branch. One thing we're quite excited about is not only the features that we're bringing back but also the huge number of bugs that have been fixed. All this together should bring a more stable and interesting DayZ experience. As we're seeing the comeback of the unconscious state, as well as everyone's favourites - the M4A1 and Mosin, alongside numerous scopes - we will consider using a specialized mission for testing these, probably switching back and forth from the regular survival gameplay to a more action packed combat scenario. I'm extremely excited to see those unconscious clutch situations getting back to DayZ, as saving people and playing a hero has always been my thing a lot more than being a bandit :) I don't want to spoil everything, but I do believe it's going to be tons of fun! See you in Chernarus! ;) - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter The implementation of the firearms scopes back into 0.63 version is ongoing for some time now. Long range combat has always been a staple of DayZ and you can count on the fact, that it will be in the future as well. The focus is to bring back scopes for firearms currently in the game and those which are coming. Switching between iron sights/scopes The new implementation introduced the ability to use iron sights along with scope view. Of course, that’s possible only when a given firearm and scope combination allows it. If you are curious, we are not planning to do slanted sights for now. Zeroing and accuracy With upcoming scopes, allowing encounters over long distances, it’s time to utilize zeroing to compensate projectile ballistic trajectory. Similarly, you should be aware of the accuracy of different firearms to choose the best tool for the job. As a side note, barrel dispersion is already back in Experimental 0.63 version for quite some time, however it seems it’s not that noticeable without magnified view of scopes. While aiming down the scope, projectiles should be fired directly from a barrel of a gun, same as it’s while in iron sights. This will prevent the possibility of some additional angle to be added to the trajectory. Unfortunately, we found out that there is a divergence between actual projectile trajectory and directional vector of the barrel, which is definitely an issue on longer ranges. We are currently going through all aspects of range combat as we are trying to isolate and fix the underlying problem. Revision of scopes Reimplementation of scopes is also a good opportunity for us to revisit individual scope models, as well as their configuration. Especially their camera positions, reticles, magnification levels and zeroing ranges. For some of them, it’s needed anyways, for example the PSO 1 can be used along iron sights, and it’s being turned into a 3D scope now, instead of just a 2D texture. This change alone requires a removal of the eyepiece to avoid the first person camera clipping, and will allow for a in-scope view as large as possible. We don’t have a picture in picture rendering, so we're looking into adding some post-processes such as depth of field, sphere distortion and colour tints to make scopes more visually pleasing. I believe that scopes will now be be easier and more fun to use. Zoom in... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Viktor The animation team has been quite busy over the past two weeks, creating some completely new animation and improving existing ones. Let me go over a few of those. New usage animations for items like a shovel, pickaxe, or hoe These should provide more variety in animations and a better representation of each item in general. Improved holding of items emitting light We have added a new animation instance and a new set of animations (walking, running, holding) for flashlight, torch, and a flare. Players are now able to have the light in better positions. Animations related to vehicles We are testing and finding the best way of adding animations for changing gears, starting the engine, and other related actions. Improvements to existing animations and systems We created new animations for when the player gets hit and added more unconscious variations for different items and stances. Additionally, we polished attacking animations and fixed bugs related to firearms animations. We've also made a bunch of new holding poses for various items, so your character can now hold items in a visually more pleasing way. - Viktor Kostík / Lead Animator Dev Update/Adam Franců This time around I won't be sharing anything brand new, as I have spent most of past few weeks squashing bugs all over the Chernarus terrain. While the 0.62 update has definitely brought Chernarus up to whole a new level, the vegetation swap also introduced a lot of issues with the object placement. This trend continued with the update 0.63, which introduced a revamp for rocks, stones and bushes as well as a number of model updates to the environment assets (be it a complete replacement or just smaller changes to the doors and ladders). It has been a long time since a proper bug fixing passed and as the updating of 0.63 is progressing, Chernarus should definitely receive some bug fixing love from us. Over the past weeks, I have squashed literally thousands of issues (major issues like getting stuck somewhere, problems with swimming, ladders, but also minor ones such as frequent object clipping). I am certainly not done yet and plan to continue this bug bash in the upcoming weeks before returning to the general map updates (for example we have got buildings like the city police station to add to the major towns). There is one more thing that I would like to mention, as it is kind of tied with the topic bug fixing. Everyone knows (and loves :)) the all-Cyrillic directional and settlements signs (did anyone say KAMYWOBO?). For a very long time, a number of settlements, railway stations and road intersections in the new (non-Arma 2) parts of Chernarus were completely missing these features. As a part of this bug fixing pass, we have re-added them along with fixing many issues with the existing signs. These changes along with the already mentioned bug fixing pass (or at least a part of it) will be available in the Content Patch #1. https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/railsign.jpg https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/dirsign.jpg https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/settsign.jpg I hope that you all have a great time exploring Chernarus, see you there! - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Dev Update/Filip Čenžák The last couple of weeks brought a number of updates from the audio department - we don't have any samples for you, but most of the things should make their way into the game soon enough. Let's go over a couple of examples: female character voice support has been added some new character sounds have been added hacking down trees cutting bark off of a tree digging mining for stones cooking (boiling, baking, drying) thunderstorm sounds were improved to capture the atmosphere of DayZ just right For the upcoming new features and content for the Experimental branch, we've mostly contributed in terms of weapon sounds: a sonic crack of bullets has been improved impact sounds of bullets have been improved Mosin and M4 sounds have seen some updates we have a brand new set of reloading sounds for each weapon we've managed to fix a bug with weapon reload sounds while on the move - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello guys, At first, I have a news for you. Our name on social channels has been changed. We were known as DayZDevTeam on our Twitter and Facebook for a long time, but now we are just DayZ. So no more weird tweets like \"I am playing @DayZDevTeam right now, come and join me!\", I am so proud of Martin, who managed to change it, it is not that easy. Don't forget to tag @dayz next time! Let's check the community content. Do you have a Samsung Gear S3 watch? Flip-Gaming.de has an inspiration for you. He made the most perfect Watch face ever and of course it is in DayZ style. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dhl5ZxoX4AQwnZJ.jpg Some of you went to real Chernarus and sent us nice pictures from your trip. Like NiloxCSHO from Reddit, who didn't need a map to travel around this area. He knows Chernarus very well. Check out the gallery here. https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/barn.JPG  I want to show you a talented player, who can make really nice screenshots. His nickname is Sp1kerZ and you can follow his work on Twitter. Keep it up, man. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiOUG8PW0AElNfy.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiNhp2EW4AA1wzS.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dhz48rwW4AEgiH6.jpg Streamer Reece McDowall shared a screenshot with us. It is about resolving struggle between players. The king is dead, long live the king! https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiN6hsoVQAAmbDx.jpg Love is everywhere, even in Chernarus. WineDaddy captured a picture of two lovers who don't care about the apocalypse. I have no idea how you made it, WineDaddy, but you did it right. https://static.bistudio.com/images/dayz/3cvbsdukw9811.jpg And the last thing from your content is a story made by M1NDR. He infiltrated a group of cannibals and tried to destroy them from the inside… And we want to congratulate M1NDR because he hit 100 000 subscribers on his YouTube channel today! You are amazing, man and we ",

However, we are diving into exciting content regardless, as we will be talking about the upcoming first big update for 0.63. And we are happy to showcase another huge collection of your awesome community content - Let's get to it! Dev Update/Eugen Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, it's about time to talk about the content update that's coming to Stress Test branch very soon and will get rolled over to the Experimental servers after making sure everything works as intended. We will try and batch the content updates in this way so we can stabilize and make sure the content works properly. AI Sensors/Audibility/Visibility With this change you will see your stealth options getting expanded by quite a bit: Besides stances, the colours and weight of items will affect your ability to avoid zombies and confuse their perception. Hidden Stash With this feature, you'll be able to hide your loot underground and put containers to use. The shovel will be spawning alongside the new containers ready to use. Same goes for corpses. https://media.giphy.com/media/FeFe0wSevF3vJJZCRn/giphy.gif Character - Unconsciousness Shock stat and weapon hits that increase it can cause the character to fall unconscious to be possibly saved by friends in your group. With the unconsciousness state, you'll be seeing more options to disable players and interact with them in combat. CPR The ability to CPR people with high shock values. Gestures The new radial menu alongside the newly added gestures will now be available for even more interactions and videos you may create. https://media.giphy.com/media/KWfkLXZ9shWSXJtS1F/giphy.gif Repairing Items like the Sewing kit, Weapon Cleaning kit, Duct tape and more are seeing a comeback as durability matters again. Weapons don't jam yet but that's something you'll definitely see in a future content update. New weapons Yes, there are new weapons coming to the game and it's two classics that everybody loves. M4A1 and Mosin. Yay! https://media.giphy.com/media/PPl2UHLn3QrexBb51Y/giphy.gif Scopes There is no definite list of scopes coming yet in the first content update, but, based on the weapons currently in the game, we will deliver a meaningful selection. Soft skills The Soft skills are getting in, so you'll see the basic specializations working and your crafts bringing better results faster. Environmental Exposure The temperature system will start working without any repercussions first to gather more information on how harsh we want to get. Jumping We have started working on a huge animation set for jumps and climbing this year. So with the upcoming update, the first part of this package is gonna get in and give you the ability to cross some basic obstacles improving your manoeuvrability throughout Chernarus. https://media.giphy.com/media/Zcox5IDVib56jAJoKS/giphy.gif Diseases Diseases and associated effects (coughing, sneezing and more) are returning as well as items that resolve possible negatives, such as purification tablets. This includes the possibility of diseases transfer from player to player and items. Compass The first part of the navigation system in DayZ besides the new map is the compass. Hopefully, it will help you to learn more about Chernarus and its intricacies. https://media.giphy.com/media/toWRrjLz2dVw6gyoWA/giphy.gif Ambient Loot One of the core features that we want to use to solve a possible lack of loot is a set of items that spawn not centrally but based on the player position and interactions. This might need a lot more tweaks, so expect its values to change even during testing. Voice Communication The whole Voice Communication system along with radios, public radios, megaphone etc. is coming to the game to give you objectives on the map as well as new options to communicate and meet with other survivors in the game. So, how soon this is going to happen? The features listed here are undergoing testing as of now and the content has been branched away from the internal development version with many more fixes and improvements to stability, security and server performance. On a side note, since in the internal version of this patch, we resolved the GDPR issues blocking the ability to switch to the experimental version, with its introduction we will enable this option for server owners. I'm personally looking forward to all this content coming back alongside things that changed and have been improved upon heavily. See you in Chernarus! - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors, This weekend, Nine Inch Nails (a band that many of us in the dev team like) had a gig at the Aerodrome festival near Prague, and guess what - Alessandro Cortini, who's been a member of NIN for quite some time now, is a fellow DayZ survivor! We could not pass on the opportunity to meet with Alessandro, and so we did bother him for a bit before he went up on stage! It's been so awesome to chat and listen to some of his stories! Just a brief look at his DayZ t-shirt reassured us that he's serious about being a fan - the condition of the t-shirt has been way, way past pristine, and so we set him up with a new one :) Check out Alessandro on iTunes or SoundCloud, and look for him on Chernarus. Remember - talk to people! You never know who's on the other side, it could be someone from your favorite band! https://i.imgur.com/9Fnt7ns.jpg Let's check out some new video content: An emotional story of the life of Ricky Jameson by CamCANTRUN recorded in DayZ and the Arma 3 Eden Editor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAO1SrvzRnk  Ant made a DayZ fan trailer and it is really nice! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh_Xf1alkHY  Rustycaddy made a video in honor of our beautiful Chernarus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDQaQtKDJ1w This is a story about the great opening of Uncuepa's bar. It starts really nice, there were a plenty delicious food, drinks and music, but what happened in the end wasn't nice… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWDGNnFsyhQ  And what about some of your pictures and drawings? Check it out: The first one is a nice edit of a screenshot by the famous DrDesync. https://i.imgur.com/1xu7afg.jpg  Another edit is made by Reddit user TheWhishImBallHorson named \"They Found Me\". Good job! https://i.imgur.com/8VWLFxY.jpg Zarrov sent us a sketch of his idea of barricading. It looks impressive! https://i.imgur.com/jRukiKK.jpg  It is an end of a school year and Barrett5Bumpas is getting bored at his classes. So he made this DayZ inspired picture. It is really nice, but don't forget - education is more important than video games! https://i.imgur.com/3Ib4spc.jpg Do you know you can change the skin of your Steam? I didn't know until today. Mdswish shared his DayZ themed customized skin with the community, you can download it here. https://i.imgur.com/44S1D7m.jpg Do you remember the photo series Humans of Chernarus? It continues and it is still really cool. If you don't know it, it is a portrait of some DayZ characters living on the DayZ Underground server, the project is inspired by Humans of New York. https://i.imgur.com/a1DHnUq.jpg And the last community content for today are Joito's Twitch alerts made by the talented Cobalt_Smobalt. They are so awesome! https://i.imgur.com/INwtDf4.gif https://i.imgur.com/TwJMmFT.gif https://i.imgur.com/JZHE9gB.gif  Let's check the riddle.

Today, Eugen gives us an update on the state of development, while Viktor and Adam from the animation team show us what they've been up to for the past couple of weeks. Our Map Designer Adam demonstrates changes to the weather system and we get some insights into the audio progress by our Sound Designer Filip. And of course we close with our community highlights, let's dive into it! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Adam Oresten Dev Update/Adam Franců Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, the Experimental release is behind us, but the work does not stop here. So I would like to look at the issues present, troubling the community playing this version and also talk about the internal development that has happened and features you'll be seeing very soon on the Stress Test and Experimental branch. We kept both of the branches active to make sure we don't break Experimental too often and have features coming into it with more polish. While 0.63 is heavy on new technology, we know it's quite light on content. But you will be able to enjoy a lot of the new stuff in the upcoming weeks. The issues that take longest to iron out are related to the stability of client and server, and problems that would end up interrupting your play sessions for various reasons. From locked characters, to server kicks or just unexpected crashes to desktop. Things are getting better, but there is more to be done in this regard and we continue to monitor the situation and apply fixes to make sure we eliminate this as soon as possible. We know its not there yet and its our top priority. We should also talk about our plan to make the Experimental servers available to server owners currently running their communities. Sadly this had to be slightly postponed due to changes necessary for GDPR and memory leaks wreaking havoc on stability and performance. These seem to be fixed as of today, so very soon you will be able to switch over and enjoy the updated version with your fellow community members on your own terms. In terms of development, we are currently moving along quite nicely with only small delays in features planned out internally. The benefits of the new technology are already showing themselves in the pace of implementation. We are also looking into possible solutions to issues that currently cause these delays and make sure we deliver. Let's go over the current state of development and features themselves. We can consider finished for Experimental phase: Hidden stash CPR Gestures Repairing UI Main Menu Soft Skills Environmental Exposure Goat - Animal Last week we have moved/continue to the review/bug fixing of: Character Unconsciousness Chambering Loop Fireplace Jump UI Server Browser Cooking Weapon/Item Swap Action/Animation Compass Gathering Ambient Loot Gathering Actions Vehicles - Open/Close doors Vehicles - Attach/Detach vehicle parts Injured Animations This week is dedicated to the internal implementation of: Climbing Weapon dispersion Weapon zeroing Weapons - Double Barrel Diseases Scopes Enfusion Hierarchy New Input System Action Animations Collisions during melee So you might be asking yourself when these things hit Stress Test and Experimental branches. We plan to switch over a bunch of these very soon, and you can expect to have these available in batches over the coming weeks. However, we want to aim for at least unconscious state to be finished in different edge cases. As of now, there are still small issues with ladder/water unconscious state interactions that are not ready for the Stress Test, but this week we should see them fixed and as such moved to the Stress Test branch alongside many other new features and content. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Viktor Hello everyone, today I would like to share with you in this short update what the animation team has been working on for the past weeks and what is going on at the moment. Obviously, the player character is important to us, so we continue improving its behaviour and what it can do. At the moment, we are revisiting some of the animations and improving them, or replacing them with better ones. This includes melee combat and its attacks. There have been some animation changes to better represent which item is the player attacking with, like a new sprint-attack with the baseball bat. Also, a lot of work has been put into finger poses so that the character is holding various items the best way it can. Some of the recent animation additions include the new IZH43 animation set, and some gestures like nodding head, shrug, and \"OK\". One of the more significant improvements to player locomotion is the ability to jump over obstacles. The feature is still work-in-progress, as well as the animations, but the character is now able to overcome small objects that are in his way by jumping over them. We are now in the process of adding all the animation variations for different directions and items in hands. At the same time, our programmer is working on the climbing for players and soon, we will start implementing animations for it. As we also started tidying up some animations and features, there is an ongoing work on player actions. This includes polishing of existing animations, some graph tweaks, but also some new animations to better visualize what the character is doing. Our Technical Animator Adam will share more details on what was happening over the past weeks regarding various animation improvements related to these actions. Make sure to check out the gifs for the baseball bat attack, cutting down bushes and, jumping. Cheers! https://i.imgur.com/bLnoXDH.gif https://i.imgur.com/yKbfhd2.gif - Viktor Kostík / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Adam Oresten For the past couple of weeks, I have been hard at work revamping, tweaking, and creating animations for many various actions. User actions are the backbone of the game, and as such, they require thought out implementation; what items can they be done with? What stances are they realistic in? Should the character be able to move during the action? All of these play a huge role in their realization, concept, and execution. I’ve implemented animations for on back actions (mainly important ones; drinking, eating, etc), tweaked some action animations to be faster or slower and cutting out unnecessary parts, depending on which type of action. I’ve also created and implemented animations for placing heavy items (barrels, generators, etc) and smaller items (bear traps, mines, etc), and I’ve also revamped the horticulture action animations, such as cutting down a tree with a two-handed axe, or one-handed hatchet, cutting down bushes, and getting bark from trees with knives or machetes. As a part of these actions, I also implemented some smaller QoL (quality of life) representative action animations for viewing compass and viewing the map to properly convey what the player is currently doing. We’re in “full steam ahead” mode with the actions and their corresponding animations, and every week we’re working on new actions and polishing the animations for the ones we already have! - Adam Oresten / Technical Animator  Dev Update/Adam Franců In our Status Report from 22 November 2016, we shared our plans to upgrade SimulWeather/TrueSky - a 3rd party library used to render volumetric clouds in DayZ. Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, we had to ultimately cancel this plan and rather focus our attention on the current implementation that is present in DayZ since the beginning of Early Access. This has not only allowed us to make necessary performance adjustments but also to take a closer look at the visuals of clouds and what could be improved within the limits of the current implementation. Here is a short summary of what has been changed: Regarding performance improvements we have reached a point, where we have decided to remove the ability to disable volumetric clouds on the client side - this change will take an effect once revamp of graphical options is finalized. There have been major changes in the cloud configuration, which are mainly aimed to make the clouds more visible and distinct from the skybox background. We improved the interaction of fog (in distance and height) and volumetric clouds, so that clouds should blend better with the horizon when it is foggy. The silver lining effect of clouds has been greatly boosted during the early to late sunrises and sunsets. The movement speed of clouds during windy conditions has been reduced and we've brought additional improvements to the skybox background textures (overcast-dependent) along with some minor tweaks to the global lighting config to support the changes in the skybox and volumetric clouds. https://i.imgur.com/LA01dM0.jpg https://i.imgur.com/Me9HqMj.jpg In addition to the changes of clouds, we have also taken a look again at the visuals of rain. These new changes include: Closeup raindrops are much more visible now. Re-added effect that tries to visualize light refraction on raindrops. Fogginess parameter has been tweaked so the rain blends better with the background. Closeup rain drops are more visible during the night-time around light sources. Rain speed has been increased.  https://i.imgur.com/RBIHhnM.jpg https://i.imgur.com/PzlC0y8.jpg Both clouds and rain changes should be available to test once the next major Stress Test branch update happens. We are looking forward to your feedback on these improvements! - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Dev Update/Filip Čenžák Hi all, The latest sound feature we started to work on are voice sounds for the character. So far we've implemented breathing when the character runs out of stamina, the sounds for holding breath while aiming in iron sight mode. and hit reactions when the character takes damage. We plan to add more sounds to create a more immersive character representation. Some of the sounds will be connected to animations, like grunts while jumping, or picking up heavy items, or sounds to emphasize melee combat. Others should be connected to character states, like the feeling of hunger or representation of disease. So far, all sounds are placeholders and in some cases, only male sounds are played. - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello everyone, the last two weeks were both really exciting and busy for us. The release of Experimental was a big milestone all of us have been looking forward to for a long time. Even though we are aware of some issues on Experimental, we are happy, that you finally can play 0.63 almost whenever you want. If you haven't done it already, check our Highlight page featuring all the good stuff from this update! https://i.imgur.com/CG8A9uT.jpg Another big event was our Community Live Stream. We knew that just a day after the release of 0.63 Experimental, there were going to be a lot of questions. Unfortunately, after announcing the stream, our beloved Eugen got sick and it was clear, that he wouldn’t be able to attend the stream. We still wanted to hold on to our promise and decided to take it as an opportunity to do our first Community Live Stream. We introduced new members of our Community team, opened Boydy's package (thanks again!) and tried to answer as many questions as possible even without the devs. As I said before, we had a Community Live Stream. I just want to explain what it means. In future, we want to stream in two formats – a developer and a community stream. On developer streams, you can expect information directly from devs and detailed answers for your questions. The second format is more community-related. Our community team wants to talk with the community about events, content from creators and all the stuff from you because you are really important to us. We tried the first community stream and we had a lot of technical difficulties (as always, it is not fun without it, is it?). Here is the VOD from the stream: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/273523726  You asked who made the music on the stream. It is a member of our community from the Netherlands called L_K_P1 who makes DayZ inspired music and we love it in the dev team! The song from the stream is named DayZ meme and here it is if you are interested: Soundcloud  Do you need a new wallpaper? I have a cool one for you made by ChernoMerlo from the DrDesync’s screenshot. https://i.imgur.com/w0BOFAJ.jpg And here is another one. I have it on my desktop already! https://i.imgur.com/FpJT6x6.jpg  Shane O’Sullivan sent me a really interesting piece of a newspaper. It is named Bohemian Post and he made it by himself. There you can find news about the infection spreading across Chernarus. https://i.imgur.com/us8K8az.jpg  Now I want to show you a special project by DayZUnderground called #TwitterPlay. It is an interactive DayZ story within Twitter and it is updated daily. People are making a story through their votes in polls and they can decide what happened with a survivor, about whom the story is. It is a really nice idea and we love it! Join the story and make your own part! You can find the latest part HERE. https://i.imgur.com/3OH2AO7.jpg  Cage, who we met personally at Pax East, sent us his custom advertisement inspired by our Nota Cola and Pipsi drinks and they are pretty creative. https://i.imgur.com/yNWImCm.jpg https://i.imgur.com/PInQaQB.jpg  And the last two pieces of content are videos. The first one is a cinematic trailer about surviving in Chernarus and it is sick. Everyone from the dev team loves it, this is amazing work by HookOak Productions! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAqpdS7FwtE  The last short clip is made by our loyal member NeuroticEUROtic and he is sharing his feelings when Experimental was near. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtOjKsAiWdk  Time for a riddle. The riddle from the latest Status Report wasn't so hard, the rock is situated on the North-West of Svetlojarsk above the train yard. Who guessed it right? Megamente Polski Tytan Beehive1982 Kerbo  This time we prepared this picture with Adam: https://i.imgur.com/yzerrYj.jpg If you know where is it, tweet it to our official Twitter account with #DayZriddleTime and you can be on the wall of fame next time.

        "contents": "DayZ standalone was released in Steam Early Access in late 2013. I bought it a month later in January, and spent over 250 hours with it before I stopped playing in October of 2014 (for reasons I&apos;ll explain below). Other than to get a gif for <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/chopping-down-trees-in-survival-games-ranked-from-worst-to-least-worst/\">this incredibly important article about how much I hate chopping down trees in games</a>, I haven&apos;t set foot inside DayZ in nearly four years. DayZ is planning on a 1.0 launch in 2018, and recently began testing its new engine on version .63 experimental servers. I decided it&apos;d be a good time to revisit Bohemia Interactive&apos;s open world survival game, to see what&apos;s changed and what hasn&apos;t, and give the new engine a spin. What&apos;s it like leaving a game in the midst of its development, and returning to it years later to find it, well, <em>still </em>in the midst of its development? There have obviously been some changes since 2014, but in ways both good and bad, DayZ feels pretty much like the same game I played years ago. Zombies are still completely unpredictable I know it&apos;s the experimental server, and it&apos;s currently missing a lot of features as they&apos;re being brought into the new engine. But it&apos;s still just so weird that when I left four years ago, the zombies were in the same state they currently are on the .63 experimental server. They&apos;re more or less completely unpredictable. It&apos;s honestly like I never left. I put a little compilation of some of my zombie encounters above. As you can see, sometimes they respect things like doors and walls, while other times they ignore them. Sometimes they&apos;ll get stuck on fences, other times they leap over them. Sometimes they try to claw me to death, sometimes they run over and just sort of stand there until I kill them. Bullets can be instantly fatal or have absolutely zero effect. I&apos;m not really judging. Games take a long time to make. I imagine switching engines midway through development means having to re-do a lot of work that was already done once. But it&apos;s still hard to see a zombie walk through a wall in DayZ <em>all these years later</em> and not be left with a sense of disbelief. Also unpredictable: the hotbar. In the last clip above, where I run out of ammo and seem to just give up defending myself, I&apos;m really trying to use the hotbar to switch from my gun to my axe. Sometimes I can easily flip between weapons, other times (like this one) it&apos;s completely unresponsive. But hey, that&apos;s what happens in an experimental build of an Early Access game. People are still unpredictable, too Toward the tail end of my original 250 hours of DayZ, I&apos;d begun to sour a bit on the experience of running into other players. Originally, it was my favorite part of the game because players were wonderfully unpredictable. Some would be nice and helpful, others completely indifferent, still others deadly or cruel. There were times I spent days running around far inland without ever seeing anyone, only to open a door in a random village and find myself face-to-face with another player. I loved it: meeting someone created an incredible amount of tension because you never knew what to expect. I met monsters, saints, roleplayers, serious players, and complete goofballs. I even had <a href=\"https://heyareyoucool.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a little tumblr set up to keep a record of my encounters</a>. DayZ seemed to change, though, slowly throughout 2014, into a game where nearly everyone just shot first and asked questions never. That&apos;s fine: all&apos;s fair in the post-apocalypse, and no doubt due to being burned one too many times, being tricked or trapped or tortured or just gunned down, it no longer made sense to risk your life and loot by approaching and talking to other players. But the tension of not knowing how someone would act was my favorite part of DayZ, and with just about everybody adopting a kill-on-sight philosophy, it lost a lot of that tension and mystery. This week on the experimental server felt a bit more like the DayZ I loved. One guy greeted me and made chit-chat, which turned out to be a distraction for his two pals who ran up behind me and punched me to death. A few players said hello but ran by without stopping. One guy invited me to come with him as he looted, and shared his spoils with me. And once I was taunted and mocked by several players hiding in a locked police station before I found one of their pals AFK outside, at which point I hacked him to death with a machete before being shot in the back when I fled. I don&apos;t know what the regular DayZ servers are like these days, but on experimental there&apos;s a healthy mix of people who want you dead, people who want nothing to do with you, and people who are interested in hanging out and working together. The sprint meter is more realistic but I still don&apos;t like it I&apos;ve written before about <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/sprint-meters-in-open-world-games-suck-and-heres-how-to-fix-them/\">my dislike of sprint meters in open world games</a>: when it comes to running around, stamina as a resource is anti-fun. I even <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/dayzs-creative-director-patiently-explains-why-i-shouldnt-freak-out-over-a-sprint-meter-being-added/\">talked to Brian Hicks about DayZ&apos;s new sprint meter</a> recently, and now I&apos;ve gotten the chance to try it for myself. It doesn&apos;t ruin the game or anything, but I&apos;m still not a fan and I honestly hope they remove it before 1.0. There&apos;s a lot of running in DayZ&#x2014;at times, it feels like there&apos;s nothing but running. It&apos;s not so much the specifics of the speed of travel that concerns me, but the disruption the meter lends to it. Having a meter deplete and then have to refill as you trot for a while is just kind of a nuisance. Sprint restrictions are one part of realism games could do without, and DayZ is no exception. Just let me run full speed all the time. Less real, but more fun. The UI is a big improvement, mostly Back when I played DayZ you were informed of your status with a series of text messages in the corner of your screen. It was useful and no-nonsense information, but there was something that felt annoyingly low-fi about it. &quot;I feel thirsty.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m thirsty.&quot; &quot;I need a drink.&quot; &quot;I feel like having a drink.&quot; &quot;I want to drink something.&quot; &quot;I really need to drink.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m dying of dehydration.&quot; These status messages arrived for everything from thirst, hunger, bleeding, sickness and food poisoning, and pain in various parts of your body. They could also get annoying when it came to body temperature, especially when it also dealt with the dampness of your clothing, how much you were moving, and if you were in the sunlight, meaning new messages could appear every few seconds informing you of fractional changes to your comfort level. Now represented by icons for health, sickness, blood loss, temperature, hunger, and hydration, you can see your status at a glance. Some of it feels unnecessary: when running and sprinting at top speed, I can kind of assume I&apos;m burning through calories and that my hydration levels are falling and don&apos;t really need those downward arrows to point it out constantly. But it&apos;s a more elegant and appealing system, even if it doesn&apos;t give you quite as much specific information. I no longer fear ladders Ladders: the silent killer. I mean, the ladders were silent, but players would be screaming with rage. In my DayZ days they were simply a no-no. You did not climb a ladder for any reason, because ladders would kill you. You&apos;d reach the top and then you&apos;d fall off. You&apos;d reach the top and somehow continue climbing, and then you&apos;d fall off. You&apos;d climb off and move away, then find yourself rubberbanded back on again. And then you&apos;d fall off. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-and-absolute-worst-ladders-in-pc-gaming/\">DayZ&apos;s ladders were the worst</a>. But no more, it seems. I haven&apos;t had any issue climbing ladders on the experimental branch. I even climbed almost to the top of the radio tower at Altar, and then climbed all the way back down. No problems. Ladders, at last, are not the most dangerous killers in DayZ. I&apos;m not sure if the guns are good or not The experimental server, as far as I could tell, didn&apos;t have a whole lot of guns on it yet, or at least didn&apos;t have a whole lot of different <em>kinds </em>of guns. Plus, half the time I had a gun I had the wrong ammo or mags for them. So, I can&apos;t really speak to how the shooting is on the new engine yet. I love the fiddly nature of the guns, though. How you have to manually open a box of ammo, load the mags one bullet at a time, then stick the mag into the gun. Even if I don&apos;t do a lot of shooting in DayZ (and when I do I don&apos;t do it well) I&apos;ve always enjoyed the level of simulation put into the weapons. Eating and drinking takes a lot longer My memory isn&apos;t perfect, but I don&apos;t remember eating and drinking taking quite so long in DayZ standalone as it does in .63. If this is a change, I think it&apos;s a great one. Realistically, no matter how hungry you are, it&apos;s going to take more than a few seconds to consume an entire can of beans or spaghetti. The process of opening cans, filling bottles, and everything else around eating seems to take longer too. I know, Mr. Anti-Sprint Meter hates being told how long he can run for but is happy to crouch in a bush for a solid few minutes to eat canned pasta and tinned sardines realistically. What can I say? I like what I like. It&apos;s great to be back As for why I quit the game in the first place, it was due to writing <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/10/23/dayz-permadeath-dairy/\">a piece for Rock Paper Shotgun back in 2014</a>, where I promised if I died during a session of DayZ I would never play it again&#x2014;a sort of perma-permadeath. It was a dumb idea, and naturally I died dumbly (and almost immediately). Returning to DayZ is pretty much me breaking my dumb promise, though if I&apos;m looking for a loophole, I&apos;m only playing it on the new engine. Perhaps a different engine means DayZ is now a different game? Despite the changes and a new engine, it definitely doesn&apos;t <em>feel </em>like a different game, so maybe I&apos;m just a lousy lying promise-breaker. Either way, I&apos;m happy to be back into it again, warts and all.&#xA0; ",

With this update, you’ll be able to experience some of the key engine changes brought to DayZ. Developing this new technology backbone for the game took the better part of the past 4 years in Early Access, and we’re very happy that we can finally let everyone play what we call “the new DayZ”.

Today, Eugen is going to talk about the upcoming weeks as our Stress Test versions gain more and more stability. Peter gives an introduction to the conditions of our new Central Economy system and Adam explains the ongoing changes to the Balota airfield. We close with some of the most memorable highlights of our community. Let's dive into it! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, As we are pushing a large amount of fixes into the current Stress Test Branch, our aim is to stabilize the build enough to launch an Experimental Branch that will be available on official Experimental severs, as well as community servers, as server owners will be able to switch over. We expect the 0.62 Stable to be played less often and we will move server resources to Experimental depending on the player interest. We expect a couple more Stress Tests to be happening this week, aimed at least a couple fixes for crashes and locked character issues. We would like to confirm these fixes over the next couple of days and have the build available during the weekend for an extended Stress Test. This will be the version we will be launching for all the players interested in moving to experimental. In the meantime, we have planned out the features that will be reviewed and connected to the new engine. This is done on the Internal branch of development and will move over to the Experimental in bundles. Last week we have moved to review/bug fixing of: Hidden stashes Chambering loop (Enabling weapon classes such as the Mosin in-game) Character - Unconsciousness CPR Gestures Repairing UI - Main Menu Polished Sensors audibility/visibility (Infected) Sheep/animations, behavior  This week is dedicated to the implementation of: Softskills Fireplace Environmental exposure Jump Weapons - double barrel UI - Server Browser Polished Goat/animations, behaviour  When these features will hit experimental, soon after the Experimental release we expect to switch over and keep doing Stress Tests for the newer builds before they move on to Experimental. The process itself is focused on connecting these features to the new character as a lot of them have been under development for a long time now. Each week we aim to deliver the implementation and dedicate the second week to bug fixing. Switching these over to Experimental will be done depending on the feature review and the community feedback that might affect priorities. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter The new Central Economy (CE) is in charge of the spawn and clean up of items, infected, animals, vehicles and dynamic events. It is easier to setup than the old CE and allows us to be more flexible with the categorization and areas of occurrence. A more precise placement can be achieved as well. After a series of internal tests during its implementation, we deployed it to DayZ 0.63. The CE is a complex system, as its behaviour develops over time and reacts to player interaction. Testing on our side was limited in scale and time. To check how the new Central Economy is behaving on a mass scale in the wild, we gathered data during the 11th Stress Test. From 18.5. to 20.5. we saved the storage files every hour across all servers which were constantly under full load. Loading this data back into the game allowed us to reconstruct how the CE behaved over time. From all the items spawned by the CE we picked the ones that are crucial for survival - food (beans, spaghetti, peaches, sardines, tuna), drinks (Cola, Pipsi, Spite, Kvass, water bottle) and firearms (Makarov, FNX45, Skorpion, IZH18, MP5, UMP45, AKM). The presented data is from the UK 0-8 server. The overview maps show where these items were spawned over time and similarly, the graphs show their overall quantity on the map over time (note that one dot means at least one item or more). To put things into context there is also a map of character spawn areas. https://i.imgur.com/24iX9cY.jpg Areas of character spawns along the coast. https://youtu.be/TnqF2boItvI An animated occurrence of food across the map from Friday to Sunday. https://i.imgur.com/sySqzIt.png Amounts of food across the map from Friday to Sunday. https://i.imgur.com/bF5TfSE.jpg Positions of food in the map at its lowest, Saturday 11:00. https://i.imgur.com/yhOCmUY.png Amounts of drinks across the map from Friday to Sunday. https://i.imgur.com/INXcHrN.jpg Positions of drinks on the map at their lowest, Saturday 09:00.  https://i.imgur.com/ggJ1FJU.png Amounts of firearms across the map from Friday to Sunday. https://i.imgur.com/NDiZQqX.jpg Positions of firearms on their map at their lowest, Saturday 15:00. From available data granularity, it can be seen that in general, there have been enough food and drinks across the map to survive, as well as firearms to provide empowerment of survivors. Interestingly, the sum of all initially spawned food in 0.62 is lower than the sum of all spawned food at their minimal quantity in 0.63 (when an item hits its minimum threshold it will start to respawn back to its initial value). It would be nice to see players adapting to a new mindset of getting prepared before starting their next trip by checking more houses and structures at their location. However, there are things which will be addressed down the road to improve the CE behaviour and its balance. It’s clear that some parts of the map are rather empty, especially in the bottom right corner. In such cases, areas for character spawns will be tweaked and more structures will be added where it makes sense. That goes hand in hand with lowering the safe radius around characters which prevents items to pop up, as in high traffic areas this can cause the lockout of entire cities. Next, it’s the settings of the CE itself playing the decisive role. The randomisation of the lifetime of more common items has to be set in a greater range, as we noticed there were cleanups of large amounts at once causing noticeable dips. Moreover, the difference between nominal and minimal values of an item makes items spread across map even more unevenly. Most importantly, the short time frame we had to ‘boot up’ the new Central Economy and the truncated list of given items to spawn, led to a sub-optimal items categorization and defined tier zones. This is the area of the CE which will become crucial when more items start to flow back into the game and we really need to nail it. With the new Central Economy we definitely have a great toolset to tune loot and its distribution as good as possible, but given the nature and complexity of it, it will take some time. Let the looting begin... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Adam As mentioned in our Status Report from April 25, we are re-designing Chernogorsk and its surroundings. If you have played on the 0.63 Stress Test Branch and visited this area, you may have seen where we are heading with this re-design. I should remind you that map changes, unlike other parts of the game, are something that is not receiving updates on the Stress Test Branch that often, because of the difficulties with the branching of map data. Anyway, I am happy to say that quite a lot of progress has been made over the past few weeks and we are nearing the final stages of polishing and optimizing the overall area. https://i.imgur.com/7JjvAcm.jpg https://i.imgur.com/lgGNc4E.jpg https://i.imgur.com/Qe2vCqG.jpg If you have played the more recent versions of the 0.63 Stress Test Branch, you may have also noticed that we have decided to re-design the Balota airfield. This change was planned for a long time and originally set to be made at a later stage of development, but since the re-design of Chernogorsk is covering the area from Balota to Elektro, we have decided to include the Balota airfield re-design in it too. Balota is such an odd spot for any type of airfield to begin with, but we feel the need for a number of airfields across the Chernarus. Now with the NWAF re-design close to being done, we have got a proper military airbase on the map and we feel like there is no need to have other military air bases. And so the airfield was completely de-militarised, the concrete runway was removed and the whole airfield was rotated a bit more facing inland (so the corridor is pointing away from inhabited areas). Given the relatively small and odd place, we have decided to transform this airfield into a local airstrip, maintained by a local flying club and have re-used NEAF buildings to support this idea (and if you ask, yes, we do have further plans for NEAF too, but not for 0.63). To give this newly re-designed airfield a backstory, it has been captured by the military forces, with most of its entrances sealed off by mostly improvised structures. https://i.imgur.com/d8fzCQQ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/NMJZmPz.jpg https://i.imgur.com/I5JxVhO.jpg - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Community Spotlight Hello guys, Let's check out what the community has for us after two weeks. I need to start with something really sad. Our community lost one of its members and a great streamer. Jen, known as Poisonantler, died under unfortunate circumstances on 8th March. We decided among the dev team to commemorate her by placing a small cross and a bench in the place where she disconnected for the last time. https://i.imgur.com/isCaxQ9.jpg  Our Brand Manager Martin Čulák accepted an invitation from our favourite Australian content creator Boydy and joined him in his podcast. Check it out, you can find interesting info in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT50aSzwUFg  I didn't expect much from a video with just walkie-talkie recording. But I was really surprised by how entertaining the video is. This is a recording of a few people's conversations from The Village server which has a very interesting ending. I really recommend to check it out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QilcAfCPMxQ  It is good to see that hand painting is not dead. This DayZ logo on a canvas made by danyuls0n's girlfriend makes us happy. We hope it is already hanging on the wall somewhere near a PC. https://i.imgur.com/9hJkAD3.jpg I know we didn't have a location riddle for a long time. Our Twitter is now overwhelmed, because of Stress Tests, so we need to identify the riddle tweets. Just tweet the location with #DayZriddleTime hashtag and I will find it! https://i.imgur.com/9Tz88KC.jpg Have a nice day(Z), Survivors! - Baty / Community Manager Header image by zombi. ",

Today, Eugen looks back at the first results from the weekend, Peter talks about missing visual indicators in the current Stress Test builds and Viktor gives a glimpse into the progress of the animation team. The Community Spotlight is defined by your first reactions to 0.63. Let's dive into it! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, at first, I would like to thank you for the amazing participation during the weekend Stress Test. It has helped us to identify a number of new issues that we are investigating as I write this. Let's take a closer look at some of those issues. Crashes and general game stability issues There have been about 200 crashes altogether over the period of two days with a couple of different causes. Some of them are new, but most are known. Hopefully, the amount of data generated will identify the pattern to replicating these issues internally and getting them fixed. Character locked in database Besides the stability issues, we are still tracking situations where a player character gets locked in a database. Although happening less often than previously, this is still a major problem that is most likely tied to a server/client crash/freeze not closing the connection gracefully, and not unlocking the character as intended. We have a possible fix for these outlier issues and crashes in our internal main Development Branch of the game and should roll these out in next few Stress Tests. Basic Central Economy balance There is an investigation ongoing into Central Economy loot distribution. Specifically, we're looking at cases where the intended gameplay loop is not properly supported by items presented/spawned to players exploring even the most remote corners of Chernarus. DayZ Central Economy The Central Economy is a complex system that controls the distribution of loot across Chernarus. It's supposed to sustain a barrage of ongoing player interaction on a given server (player picking up and dropping loot, taking it across different servers...), with the goal to keep the core gameplay loop during a gameplay session challenging, encouraging players to learn, and eventually master the survival in DayZ. At the same time though, it needs to be a fun gameplay mechanic. It's important to note that the Stress Tests are our first real opportunity to really see how the Central Economy behaves in 0.63, as we're just not able to internally reproduce the behavior of large amount of players in the game. That ultimately puts us at the very beginning of all the balancing. During Stress Tests, we are extracting economy states over periods of time to understand the players movement and their interactions. This in turn helps us understand where our priorities should be within the spawning system. The second part of our loot/basic survival mechanic problem is the character representation itself - meaning how healthy/hungry/thirsty your character is. That sets the pace to this core gameplay loop of keeping your character fed and alive. Any potential tweaking of character representation values depends on the findings of our loot distribution tests. We will have to cover a lot of possible border cases that happen to players. Additionally, we will (as previously suggested) also play around with the overall player numbers per server, and we will need to see how to scale the Central Economy with the player numbers going up, possibly all the way to a 100 players per server. How do we prepare the Stress Test release packages Since I've mentioned our internal Development Branch earlier, I also wanted to explain the process behind the scenes that goes into releasing a Stress Test itself. Internally, we have created a new branch of DayZ for data and changes that we specifically need to run public Stress Tests. Software Branching Branching, in revision control and software configuration management, is the duplication of an object under revision control (such as asource code file or a directory tree) so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches. More in a related Wikipedia article. We've been merging various fixes and surgical tweaks to the game on that branch, while the regular development has been ongoing on our main Development Branch. With Stress Tests, we are trying to gather data on specific problems that require a high-stress environment with tons of players coming in and out of the server, pushing all gameplay systems to their limits. That is specifically the case with loot distribution and all player interactions tied to it. Stabilizing these interactions and making them somewhat consistent with a decent amount of variety is our primary goal. We want you to experience that feeling of discovery when you find what you need at a certain moment. Especially if it's a rare item. Looting is a big part of the DayZ gameplay, we know how much this can affect the enjoyment from fighting for your life in Chernarus, so with each Stress Test, we set a goal and a particular combination of data that we want to gather within a specific gameplay element or system. Then, we add extra logging to these interactions, helping us to decide on the next action we should be taking. It's only a small part of the development though. The Development Branch has seen a lot of additional optimizations already, even including fixes to several different issues that you have been experiencing, so our goal now is to leave the Stress Test branch to keep the development pace going forward. Our Development Branch is where the progress towards experimental goals happens, so it's about time we make sure this branch is viable for live playtests. To ensure we really are ready to do that switch, we will release a short Stress Test based on the code/data of that branch before we go on for another longer Stress Test. Once again, I want to say a BIG thank you for the feedback coming in, it's what makes this community special. All of us want a great game, no doubts about it! - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter In the last Status Report I was commenting on the community feedback regarding firearms in our DayZ Stress Tests. Today I will continue with different elements which are related to them. Weapon switching animations As is pretty obvious, the animations for swapping items from the inventory to the hand slot are missing. Especially with weapons, this creates a gameplay problem, as a lack of visual communication turns a harmless disarmed character into a threat in a split second. Currently we are implementing these item switch animations and, along with them, we are changing one important thing - shoulder slots will be no longer be dedicated. That means you will be able to carry two long firearms or two melee weapons as needed. As we progress with 0.63, a slot for a belt will also be added, opening possibilities for an additional pistol holster, knife sheet, or quiver. A slot for the bow is considered as well, but there needs to be a bow implemented first to see how it will work with non-dedicated shoulders. Hit feedback Another part missing is animation feedback of a target being hit with a projectile, as we turned that specific feature off for the Stress Test. We ran into a problem where even additive impact affected the aim of a firearm. Such an authentic affair quickly becomes a very unpleasant mechanic, preventing a reaction by putting you in a disadvantage after being hit - the only chance was that the shooter will miss or have to reload so your aim can recover in the meantime. We will have to address this issue as we would like to have animated feedback following a projectile hit. Bleeding On a different issue, bleeding and its treatment are basic DayZ mechanics. Unfortunately, without the new parent-child hierarchy, which is being implemented as we speak, we cannot pin particle emitters to the character properly and animate them with it. We've decided to postpone the visual representation of bleeding particles as well. Admittedly, this is a bad timing, as in 0.63 you have to treat every bleeding source individually. With slightly unresponsive progress arrows of the blood stat icon (more about indicators later) and no way to tell if there are some bleeding wounds left, it’s hard to say how many times you should bandage. Overall balance Apart from that, please be aware that many elements you see in the game right now have not been not through a basic balance pass just yet. From digestion, regeneration speeds and stamina, through damages of melee and projectiles to the weight of items, their sizes, and cargo spaces... it’s safe to say that basically everything will be adjusted more or less and it is connected to some degree with the lack of features, mechanics, and content, which will be added down the road during the 0.63 Experimental phase. Oh, and it will be a ride... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Viktor The animation team is now focused on several parts of the player character. We are now in the phase of improving and finalizing the prone system. Animations for crawling in prone on the back, which have been missing until now, are being added. The cameras and some poses are not final yet as well. And of course, after the animations are finished, we will have to do a couple of rounds of bugfixing for prone on the back before we tick it off as done. Another important part that is in progress, is overcoming obstacles. We now have a working prototype for jumping, but we are still in the process of adding missing animations. Meanwhile, there has been some work done on climbing over higher obstacles. These are divided into multiple levels, and different animations will be played depending on the height of the obstacle. Close combat will see some changes as well. As we want to have more variation to the combat, we are adding new animations for the baseball bat. These should better reflect the item. In the future, we want to continue with this and add more item specific attack animations. Last but not least, there is ongoing work on firearms, vehicles, user actions, infected and also tons of general bugfixing. All of these areas are a longer term task, but you should see constant improvements in the game with everything related during Experimental. But for now, let's check out some gifs!

Why was it so amazing? Because of you! You were simply being a fantastic help during the Stress Test! 30 482 of you have already tried the first version of update 0.63. Wow, thank you! We've had so much feedback, that I wasn't able to read it all in just one day! We were watching streamers the entire weekend and we are really happy to see your love for DayZ. You had a lot of fun, we saw all the emotions, it was so awesome. https://i.imgur.com/by3PGZW.jpg https://i.imgur.com/NNKGb9C.png For a while, DayZ was the second most watched game on Twitch this weekend, it reached more than 76 000 viewers and it has been played by some of the biggest streamers such as Summit1g, Anthony Kongphan or shroud and they were having a good time too. https://clips.twitch.tv/SweetSingleSparrowUnSane?tt_content=player_title&tt_medium=clips_embed https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokyAstuteSharkPeteZaroll?tt_content=player_title&tt_medium=clips_embed https://clips.twitch.tv/BetterImpossibleAniseBIRB?tt_content=player_title&tt_medium=clips_embed You did a great job with videos this week. I found this cinematic made by DaGuyd and it is pretty impressive. Check it out, it is only under 2 minutes long: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlDXNh2oTdI Another cinematic short named Loot Lost is made by our favorite Status Report reader Septic Falcon. And we like it a lot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iu0gJhTZpk And here is a creepy story about a cannibal doctor who loves the flesh of his patients by MarcusGalic. Eating people is bad, isn't it? Who knows… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPKrkNui700 Look at this true hero! His name is Reginald and he is a humanitarian in Chernarus. His mission is help to people and he is very good at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL3oMU62or4 The last video is from the well known double trouble creators - Vertiigo and MrMoon. It is a really funny story of friends lost in the wilderness - they are best friends until the hunger comes… I almost died laughing watching this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZNxnoxXLEY I love your creativity and your passion for DayZ on both real and virtual paper. Art pieces like these make me happy and I thank you for them. This one is made by AStupidAnt from Reddit. It took him about 4 hours and he did a really good job. https://i.imgur.com/mFNEMuH.png This photo is from a true DayZ fan, ScarecrowCOD. He even has a gas mask! And check the painting on the wood he made. Nice! https://i.imgur.com/xNvCIf9.jpg That is all from me, have great two weeks and see you on the next Stress Test! - Baty / Community Manager Header image by BubsonHD. ",

Hicks said in a <a href=\"https://dayz.com/blog/status-report-may-8-2018\">farewell message</a> that he&apos;s excited for the release of the .63 update, but he also believes that the game has reached a point where he is &quot;no longer needed.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;For the last year, I have been slowly taking more and more of a back seat (as I&apos;m sure some of you have noticed) and tried to push folks like Peter, Adam, and others to let their voice be heard.

Lead producer Eugen Harton said recent stress testing of the .63 build &quot;has been a step in the right direction,&quot; although he added that a lot of work remains to be done. The next round of stress testing hasn&apos;t been scheduled yet, but DayZ remains slated for a full release <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/dayz-is-now-slated-to-leave-early-access-in-2018/\">sometime this year</a>.&#xA0; ",

We’ve received so much feedback from you guys and we’re going to dive right into it; but first, there is someone you probably haven’t read in a long time! Dev Update/Brian Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Brian Greetings Survivors, I can't begin to tell you how great it has felt for myself, for Peter, and honestly for the whole team to see all of your reactions to the work that has been done on .63, and DayZ as a whole. For what seems like years, a big part of the team (especially Design and Animation) have worked on documentation and internal prototypes without hardly any feedback. To finally be able to start sharing some of this with you all (and thanks to platforms like Twitch, Youtube, Mixer, etc - SEE) and hear your thoughts has been the most uplifting since the Early Access launch on Steam. It’s a good day for DayZ and the DayZ community. I can not wait for .63 to hit experimental (and stable as well of course!) and begin to be able to spend more time with you all in this new DayZ experience in longer play sessions. With that said - I feel DayZ has reached a point in which I, much like how Dean felt years back - am no longer needed. I've spent years talking to you all, working with the team, and collaborating with Peter on where we want DayZ to be, how we want DayZ to feel. Now that you have started to see, and touch DayZ .63 I feel like our plans, our dreams are finally within grasp. Peter Nespešný and the design team have a rock-solid grasp of what DayZ is, and what it needs to be. All of our systems have been discussed, documented, and discussed again. For the last year, I have been slowly taking more and more of a back seat (as I'm sure some of you have noticed) and tried to push folks like Peter, Adam, and others to let their voice be heard. Over that year I have made plans for what is next for me and worked for free with Peter Nespešný in a design consultant role. I won't lie - it hasn't been easy, and there have been times where Peter and I both were uncertain about how .63 would be received, or how it would perform under full-scale load. I don't want to be a broken record - but I am so happy that all of those concerns have been washed away. DayZ has been my life, made my life - and been so ingrained in who and what I am that I won't be able to just walk away. Hell, I've just crossed 7,000 hours between two accounts. From here, I look forward to opportunities back home in the States, being closer to family, and playing DayZ as much as I possibly can. I certainly have not forgotten my promise to TSM Smak to do a 24-hour stream when DayZ hits 1.0. See you out there in Chernarus folks, the sun is rising and the future looks bright. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Survivors, before I start, I have to thank Brian for his contribution to DayZ over the years and wish him the best in his future endeavors. His passion is an inspiration to many. And I’m pretty sure we will be seeing each other in DayZ all the time :). I know we both wish for the game to grow and improve and finally testing the 0.63 has been a step in the right direction although a lot of work remains to be done. On that note, I want to thank you for participating in the last few stress tests. Feedback is coming in from every channel and we read all of it; from our forums, Reddit, Twitter, and more. I noticed a couple of topics that are coming up, and I want you to know we will be looking at these in the testing of both stress test build and experimental. We will prioritize resolving issues depending on their severity or their impact on the gameplay, while also working on more advanced features like climbing, vehicles and base building alongside that. I want to remind everybody that these will be part of the experimental build but probably won’t appear in its first iteration. It is extremely important to test these during experimental because as soon as we move the build to the stable branch, we want to focus on bug-fixing and tweaking. Don’t forget that as soon as we hit experimental, customer servers will be able to switch over. Now let’s get back to the things that were tested thanks to Offline DayZ being available, although it is definitely not representing the DayZ experience yet. Distant sounds, not hearing a gun or where is it coming from, or megaphone audio not traveling far enough; all of these things require tweaking as most of the initial configuration has not seen a revision yet, we will be looking into these as we progress with experimental. Distant lights, either a flash from a gun or a camp far far away; now these issues sadly have no simple solution, but we are talking about possibilities and will experiment with those as we get further down the development. Inventory visuals and functionality; a lot of the underlying tech is in, and visuals are still WIP. However, there are a lot of things we want to improve and work on during the ongoing testing. We want the game to feel physical and consistent in its behavior, as well as making sure things are telegraphed to a player when they need to be, focusing on the user experience of crafting and manipulation. The idea is there it just needs a lot of bug-fixing and tweaks. Besides the issues mentioned above there is an amazing amount of gameplay feedback, from the crosshair interactions, reload mechanics, aiming, shooting, controls, actions and more. We will be looking at what has been said and discussed and I know Peter will talk about these in much more detail over the next few status reports. As already mentioned before our next goal is multiplayer testing with infected and I’m definitely looking forward to that one! - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter Two weeks passed since the first Stress Test of DayZ 0.63. In the meantime, there have been another three more Stress Tests plus we added the possibility to play in an offline mode if you are interested in trying out what’s on the table with the “new” DayZ. During this time we gathered a lot of qualitative and constructive feedback from you - our community, which I am very glad for (read past Status Report to find more about my feelings designing something without feedback for so long). Now I would like to comment on the most important things through the Status Report, which is the most effective way on how to reach most of our players. As most of you know, our goal is to make everything to feel as tangible as possible, so you really need to be making things over time, at least most of the core actions. In this respect, we chose to have reactive raise of hands. To maintain the active stance, in which you can endanger others or defend yourself against them, you need to hold a dedicated button. Once you remove your hands from controls, the character should be rendered as relaxed and harmless. Telegraphing intentions and what’s going on is one of the most important aspects of DayZ. However, from feedback it seems like there is no problem with holding raise to become actionable, but more with the actual switching to iron sights while the firearm is raised. Currently, this is bound to MMB/LSHIFT, which obviously feels awkward and clunky, especially when it’s on another hand than the one controlling aim and shooting itself. One solution is to a double-click of raise and then hold it to enter ADS directly, but unfortunately, proof of concept which was available in first Stress Test, was implemented in a very crude way and it felt very unpleasant, confusing and it did not meet with understanding. Personally, I think a chain of actions is fine, firstly I’m raising my firearm to do some immediate shooting or I enter aiming down sights to get better precision, especially on mid to long range. On the other hand, I know that I will be upset finding myself in an advantageous sniper position and having to hold raise for the whole time waiting for the right moment to strike the target. I can assure you that we are very aware of this discrepancy and we want to solve it. As many of you already suggested, and we are tending to it for some time already, the solution is to simply have raise still on hold, but ADS (aim down sights) togglable from a lowered stance. While I’m not a huge fan of such kind of “togglability” of states (you won’t believe me how much it triggers me off watching friendly survivors talking by a fire while aiming at each other's faces), we will definitely try some other ways to address this until we end up with implementing this simplest solution. Another thing which is causing some tables flipping around is ‘hip fire’, respectively how accurate it is. Actually, it’s not hip fire, as the firearm is in the same position as while being ADS - the only difference between these two is the camera position - but for simplicity’s sake let’s call it ‘hip fire’. In the first place, it needs to be clear that ‘hip fire’ is not meant to be accurate by any means. It should be used for immediate reactions at very close ranges. Anyways advantage of it in its current state is coming from several factors. I already mentioned non-ergonomic switching to ADS above. First off we changed how the direction of the projectile trajectory is calculated while shooting from ‘hip fire’. Currently, it’s always heading from the weapon to the center of the screen. In the previous version .62, bullets were always fired out in the direction of a barrel of a gun, which didn’t make sense to anyone, which led us to introduce a floating crosshair to show where the barrel is pointing at (you kinda know to estimate that direction even when firing from hip IRL). However hunting this floating crosshair which is jumping across the screen like crazy is unpleasant and in the end, doesn’t make sense. So why not simply shoot towards the center of the screen - hence the change. Of course, the current implementation has a few worst cases where it’s not working properly or very badly to be honest, but those will be fixed one by one. Another thing is that after the rewrite of the weapons we are missing implementation of dispersion - random cone-shaped spread defined by angle. Previously it was used as kind of an inaccuracy from the manufacturing process where long barrel weapons were most accurate and short barrel ones were least. We are not using it anymore as I think ‘fighting’ some random nonsense on mid to long ranges is over the top, as players are already challenged enough by mechanics like sway, recoil, zeroing, actual bullet speed and drop - all that combined with character movement, which is enough. However, if it’s applied only while using ‘hip fire’ it can help to introduced much welcomed inaccuracy on mid to long ranges. For now, we will try to address it with modified sway while not in ADS to see how it works out. Next thing is the overly precise crosshair for ‘hip fire’. The former crosshair was ugly for sure, but in its size, it wasn’t precise at all, thus it was hard to assess the center of the screen, but still good enough to show the direction of shots. After a massive outcry about how ugly the crosshair is, we change its look as it is very simple to do - and to show you how a simple change can have a huge impact on gameplay, which, not surprisingly, you don’t like. In the past during internal playtest we ran a series of tests without a crosshair, but people were mostly unable to shoot anything even on close ranges during stress situations which required fast reactions. Personally, I’m for the complete removal of the crosshair, but then there are plenty of 3rd party software or monitors allowing to overlay crosshair on screen, making it unfair to those playing fair. By the way, you can disable crosshair (along with dot) from options (game>crosshair>off). Forcing disable of crosshairs will be also available server side. As a mix of all the above, there is a possible exploit now with ‘hip fire’ where you can fire immediately after pressing the button for raising firearm where the dot can be abused for super precise aim. Of course, this will be fixed down the road.  Advanced firearms manipulation and subsequently accentuate usage of quick slots as pockets with instant access to items in them, is related to the philosophy of DayZ’s survival element - being prepared for possible things to come. Using quick slots for anything else beyond the switch of items in hands is not standard at all and it needs some time to get used to it for sure. Compared to old DayZ (.62 and previous versions), we changed loading weapons to hold-action, instead of just click, for a reason that weapons with internal magazines will be loaded continuously - same as how feeding detachable magazines works now. Next, we enriched the usage of quick slots for initiating any combining actions, basically crafting, but I have to see someone to using it like that yet, as it can save a lot of time and inventory access. Anyways quick slots have that disadvantage that they are kind non-ergonomic, especially for hold-actions which is of course a problem. Just the fact, that R key isn’t working as it’s used to work across all action games, which is so deeply rooted standard, inflames most of the players. I would like to point out, that currently, we cannot present you the big picture, where the pieces fit together - and that’s manually charged firearms like bolt action rifles or pump shotgun - which internal magazines can be continuously loaded and have to be manually charged prior to every shot, where R is used for now as it’s manipulation using a mechanism of the weapon. Even if it will be still unclear and uncomfortable after that, we have already plan B prepared, which makes R key to behave in ways people are more accustomed to. In that case, R would reload magazine or chamber (most probably from pre-prepared items in quick slots) while holding R would manipulate with the mechanism, or unjam it in such chase. We will be able to see and evaluate once manual firearms are implemented. There is also critique regarding weak recoil. It’s good to know, that the new system for recoil is good, however, there is only one setting used across all weapons for now if I’m not mistaken. As it was tweaked for low caliber pistol, of course, it seems very off using an AKM. Better recoil patterns will be added gradually. From other stuff related to gunplay which is also being questioned is hold breath. To be more specific - its default keybind, which is currently set to left CTRL. At first it seems to be non-ergonomic, but on the other hand, it makes sense as it’s paired with the walk modifier. With the upcoming new input controller we will separate these actions from each other, so we will be able to bind them independently. It’s worth to mention that most actions of the new character are hardwired to the actions of the old one which is gone for a long time now. This means we are in some occasions limited in achieving the desired result (for example we are still missing hold-action for environment interaction - currently bound to F, which limits us in the introduction of continuous actions, like drinking from the pond). Until the new input controller is in I would advise you to not rebind controls as it can completely mess up a new character in some cases. Seems like I already made it into a solid wall of text even as I wanted to comment on other stuff as well in no particular order, like weapon changing animations, bleeding, hit impacts, falling, stamina, HUD and tendency icons, headbob, fake inertia, clipping issues in FPP, inventory, infected behavior, melee combat, balancing in general, lack of content and more. But I would better stop right there and leave those for next Status Report. Brian, thank you for all your hard work for DayZ, your passion will be missed... see you in Chernarus man! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer Dev Update/Mirek Hello survivors, today, I'd like to write about current Stress Tests, how they are helpful to us programmers (especially server-side stuff) and what's the plan with next Stress Tests. Secondly, I will write about our progress on the infected. First of all, I want to thank all of you who are participating in these Stress Test sessions. They already helped us to find performance bottlenecks, some thread deadlocks, sources of crashes and connection issues. We fixed several of these issues and we're working on the rest. We've prepared some performance optimizations, which are in our internal branch and are ready for internal testing. Our current Stress Test scenario, where all players are spawned in the same city, is probably the worst case for server performance and network traffic. Although we're quite happy with the numbers we received, we'll continue to improve performance till DayZ hits stable in version 1.0. The next Stress Tests scenario (I'm not sure now when it will happen) will look like your ordinary DayZ session, which means that players will be spawned at different places and infected will be present. In these sessions, we will try to continuously increase player and AI numbers to see how intense we can populate Chernarus. Please keep in mind that the AI can be still buggy in these test so don't be angry if you'll be killed by infected which went through a wall (I will explain why this is happening in next paragraph). So, now about the infected status. Some of you have met them in our recently released offline mode and noticed that they can go through obstacles sometimes. This is known to us and it's happening because we decided to save some performance on collision detection, therefore we've disabled collisions between AI units and static objects during movement - the navigation system should keep AIs on the navigation mesh and that's the reason why we disabled this collision detection. This bug is one with the highest priority and hopefully we will fix this navigation issue soon. About infected and their features - basic movement, stealth mechanics, and fight logic are in place and we are iterating them. Designers are tweaking infected senses, which means they are balancing how infected can spot a player depending f.e. on player's stance or clothing which they wear. We're adding some more movement features right now - turns and crawling. Crawling will be there a little bit later because not all animations are ready now for this movement state, but here you can at least see transition animations in the game: https://media.giphy.com/media/wJPi4L0vLsMrjgnp4v/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/5ts18Y7v4ZftwFc7DV/giphy.gif Turning - I think it will be best if you look at these samples, to see what that means - I believe these will make stealth and fight funnier: https://media.giphy.com/media/8JZmX0Ez0xCb7JrSeD/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/YjhQQAHynOCKsssMpb/giphy.gif '  And that's all for now. As you can see, stability improvements and infected are our current milestone. Hopefully next SR we will be able to show you more from other game features. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Programmer  Dev Update/Filip Hi all, over the last couple of weeks, we've made several improvements. We’ve implemented ambient sound attenuation for interiors and added a smooth transition between outdoor and indoor states. The number of ambient sounds that can play simultaneously is now higher plus we’ve added a few new controllers, so sound can react more dynamically to weather changes. Regarding doors, we redesigned door open/close sounds and added over 200 new sounds in the process. On a different issue, the localization of sound sources in 0.62 did not work very well. The visual position did not correlate with the position of the sound. Especially with animals, which you can hear over long distances, this slight offset made them hard to locate. This is why we decided to redesign vector panning. We are very happy with the changes we did for stereo configuration and now we are concentrating on surround configuration. - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors, it is finally beautiful weather outside, but who cares when you can play the Stress Tests! We released four Stress Tests already as well as an offline version of DayZ and we received a lot of feedback from you. We are glad you are helping us to fix all these annoying bugs and crashes.  Let's check what you've sent us through our social networks.  This is really cool. An old friend of Sweetest_Kill gave her a DayZ-themed bat with her name on it. It is a nice gift, but please, don't use it on living creatures. https://i.imgur.com/IdJvSaJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/1l9xu4S.jpg   Guys, I want to show you a great video made by HandZ. It has everything - sadness, regret, violence, moral decision-making, betrayal and death. Great work HandZ, it is one of the best live action videos we ever saw. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwUjeJmc66E DickieTheChamp made a cute DayZ inspired USB. It is a small can of Pipsi and I want it so bad! https://i.imgur.com/GpNTFU6.jpg  If you think it is only violence and blood in DayZ, we want to show you that you are not right. You can find love there as well. Mach and FubarBundyy can confirm we are right because they met in DayZ and they fell in love with each other. They are just celebrating one year together! So adorable! https://i.imgur.com/TKOpjYC.jpg   Willkillshill shared his selfie photoshoot with us, from when he was playing on one of the Stress Test session. And it is hilarious. https://imgur.com/a/W936yeahttps://imgur.com/a/W936yeahttps://i.imgur.com/JoXIts5.jpg https://i.imgur.com/cS0vAfx.jpg https://i.imgur.com/DKAT0ky.jpg  And now some real Chernarus thing - on Reddit, zverus showed pictures of the real Nord East Airfield named Nalivaikivka airstrip, which is located near Kiev in Ukraine. Check it out, it is really interesting: https://i.imgur.com/ykKT4fq.jpg https://i.imgur.com/ogST9ux.jpg https://i.imgur.com/9w5K7FL.jpg  That is everything from me today, If you have anything you want to share with us, just send it to our official Twitter account and I will check it out! - Baty / Community Manager Header image by Punchy McSlap.

It's not Tuesday, but it's still Status Report time, so let's read! Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Jan Dev Update/Boris Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear DayZ players. All of us here are both playing and tweaking the version for the first Stress Test. You might be asking why it's not out yet, and how on earth we are enjoying it and not sharing that with you? :). The current state of the build, although fun and quite consistent, is still a bit unstable. And what I mean by unstable? In the worst gunfights with large numbers of players and looting, we can still see at least up to 10 different crashes averaging in up time of less than an hour. We fixed about 500 bugs so far for this Stress Test alone, and there is about 50 left. About 10 of those are crashes that have been plaguing our most recent internal playtests. The good news is that we were finally able to debug the reasons behind these, and are working on fixes as you read this. https://i.imgur.com/Ar6g77l.jpg Quick look at the issues that need fixing for 0.63 Experimental as of this afternoon (not including features that still need to be implemented). Click to Enlarge Once these fixes are confirmed, and if nothing else pops up (usually does, but fingers crossed!), we will evaluate the state of the build again and start with Stress Testing. We are as anxious as you to get this ball rolling :). Now for the work invested into things that are not launching with either Stress Tests or with the first Experimental build: there are about 1000 bugs fixed so far for Experimental and we are doing some heavy work on UI visuals and functionality to go beyond the basics needed to develop on the new engine. Jumping has got into the game with its first iteration and will be followed by climbing later as we polish animations and possible edge cases where players get stuck. On the notion of having other means of movement rather than walking and running, we are still working on 0.63 vehicles, and also the first helicopter iterations for internal testing. These are still heavy work in progress as vehicles, base building, and several other features are still waiting for a commit (= implementation to the main game code) of technology that we have mentioned a couple of times: enabling hierarchy between entities in the game. We will move on to that commit once we confirm that there are no larger issues during Stress Tests. Just to give you some scope (since I started using numbers) over the years, we have tracked around 30 000 issues and resolved about 25 000 of them, where resolving means that some have become irrelevant on their own either due to change of tech or design (Expired, Won't fix, Duplicate, As Designed and other resolution types in the chart below except for Done or Fixed). Part of the remaining unresolved issues is also related to post 1.0 content and features: https://i.imgur.com/Em65rZn.jpg A quick look at the issues that need fixing for 0.63 Experimental as of this afternoon (not including features that still need to be implemented). I'm excited about what's to come with the first stress test and feedback that we can work with. I'll be there trying to survive there with you! :) Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Jan Hello everybody! Voice communication is something we haven't really talked about for some time. So I'm here to introduce you to the changes we've done on the gameplay side. But since this is my first Status Report, I'll start with a small introduction. My name is Jan Huňka (on the internets, I go by the nickname Zoidy) and I work on DayZ as a Gameplay Programmer specializing on networking - but I also worked on the new damage system, login/logout process and a bunch of other things. The main goal of these changes was to make the communication as seamless as possible. As soon as your radio has a battery in, you can talk on the selected frequency. If you turn it off, you're automatically using direct communication again. Currently, we have three types of communication devices in the game. Megaphone, personal radio and also a Public Address System. Radios Personal radios are very easy to use. You don't need to hold the radio in your hand, it can be anywhere nearby like in the inventory or just on the ground and you can still use it. Other survivors nearby can also use your radio if they're close enough. To transmit on larger distances, you can use big radio stations. Signal strength is based on the maximum distance. The closer you're to the maximum distance, the more noise you're gonna hear. The same goes for the text chat. The closer you're to the max distance, the more can your text message be corrupted. https://i.imgur.com/sDFgtoO.jpg Public address system (PAS) We placed quite a few PAS loud-speakers across the cities of Chernarus and now you'll finally be able to use them. PAS broadcaster can broadcast your voice to all loud-speakers in range. You just have to stand close to the broadcaster. It is also possible for multiple players to use the broadcaster at the same time. Listening players are hearing voices of the speakers from the loud-speakers based on its distance and direction. https://i.imgur.com/aADiXIg.jpg https://i.imgur.com/c4Bl6eG.jpg Megaphone Megaphone needs to be held in hands to use and it basically allows your voice to be heard on larger distances than just talking. https://imgur.com/fpGyWAF.jpghttps://imgur.com/fpGyWAFhttps://imgur.com/fpGyWAF https://i.imgur.com/UI6CiTB.jpg Server keeps information about nearby communication devices that every player is currently able to use. This information is then cross-referenced against other players and the result is a \"list\" of players that you can communicate with. All voice messages and also text chat messages are routed to appropriate clients using this information. Thanks to this, you can transmit your voice to multiple devices at the same time. For example, if you want to set up some radios on different frequencies nearby your PAS broadcaster and then broadcast your amazing speech on all possible channels and PAS at the same time, it is completely possible. Contrary to the original plan, you cannot use one device to transmit to another device. Like leave your personal radio nearby PAS broadcaster. The chains of devices that could be created using this feature could become very complex really fast. We would also need to constantly check all communication devices on the whole map to update these chains, which could get costly in terms of resources. But we'll try to keep this in mind and maybe this feature could make it to the game on some smaller scale. We added and tweaked the sound filters for different types of devices. Radios still have their typical noise, but megaphones and public address system received some nice echo effects, so you should be able to tell what device is the source of the sound. If, for example, there are three radios around you on the same frequency, you're gonna hear the same voice with a little echo, so you can recognise the same voice is coming from multiple sources. The echo is calculated based on the number of devices and their distance from the player. Thanks for reading and I hope you're gonna have a lot of fun with the new communication system in Chernarus! Jan Huňka / Gameplay Programmer  Dev Update/Boris Survivors! I have some news from our scripting team - I'm happy to say that the system for weapon particle effects has been finished for some time now, so here is a small sample of the quality of muzzle flashes you can expect to see in the 0.63 Stress Test: https://hsgm2q.db.files.1drv.com/y4mIfDygXue9Ea7L4GkWcYP96kVErsCWmfpxtEKpu4pfn0gUp-eoEXM9RuqA8S3Rqmayr8aVcm8W96fvzgRPeiX2Mx0lW0XUH0E2oxSEVXvk3kfodyGRrBd4Ap_n80eQzbuHGraoV8CY6NvMcbqf1rTYugaFzQGP88h1bLGI9tJbDVZBLZzX2X8a1U3ghSOke6aV96KwcPtn3vQ-yiuh4EfbpuI5bZ5nxKNGrR1HvpuinE/muzzleflash5.gif?psid=1.gif Note that rapidly firing for a prolonged amount of time will heat up the barrel, causing a continuous stream of smoke until it cools down. In later experimental updates, badly worn out weapons will tend to smoke more as build-up collects in them, which prompts players to use the weapon cleaning kit to avoid malfunctions. The next task related to gunfights is the improvement of bullet impact effects (including blood splats), which are meant to better visualise our advanced ballistic system. Currently, we have a simplified placeholder system implemented until the final solution is fully prepared. Fire away, survivors, but mind the heat of your gun barrels! Boris Vacula / Scripter  Community Spotlight/Baty Hello guys! I don't know if you noticed, but me and my colleague Martin were invited by Microsoft to show you the Xbox One DayZ DEMO at PAX East in Boston. Yes, we already have a playable single player 0.63 demo that runs really smooth, and this was the first time we presented the Xbox version to public! We were a bit nervous about the reactions, but your enthusiasm about the demo calmed us down and we were really happy that you liked it. Xbox players had a chance to try the demo for the first time, running around and exploring what DayZ is all about. Meanwhile, experienced PC players were testing new features, because it was also the first opportunity for the to get their hands on 0.63. If you want to see a personal experience of one of our players, here is a video from Jake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGOH6h2KZtk And of course, we've met so many nice people who we know only from online communication. For me, that was the highlight of the show. Thanks everyone who stopped by and talked to us or just tried the demo! Our little station was right there. Massive thanks to Microsoft for inviting us to their booth! https://i.imgur.com/i8DXZG5.jpg Pax East was so crowded! https://i.imgur.com/eFv6ioz.jpg We've met a couple of survivors in DayZ cosplay! https://i.imgur.com/cj7U5Pi.jpg https://i.imgur.com/98pkFXN.jpg https://i.imgur.com/mjtj74L.jpg Some streamers like MarkstromTV, TheLoyalPatriot, LtDanOfficial, Mr. Moon, Deadly Slob, GamerDad, Johny Rotten, Puhdado, Acesfury and Jakon tried our demo too. https://i.imgur.com/YGgJyT8.jpg https://i.imgur.com/RFnuLqi.jpg https://i.imgur.com/0myjm2v.jpg So many amazing people came to Pax to meet us. We love you guys. https://i.imgur.com/9JxZU6P.jpg https://i.imgur.com/raCJWhy.jpg Community Events Let's check out some events on private servers. The first one is organized by DayZ Underground server and it is called \"king of Severograd\". Be ready tomorrow at 4PM EST. Don't forget to register! https://i.imgur.com/3uJmnhw.jpg  Another one will be on Saturday at 7pm CST on the DayZ Noob server and it is melee weapons only. You can win a fully decked M4A1, AK101, AK74, FAL and AKM. Nice prizes! https://i.imgur.com/aPxFihE.jpg  And the third one is today, so run and join other survivors on TopeRec&Spaggie's server (185.16.86.37:2602) at 20:00GMT as soon as possible. https://i.imgur.com/Uckzg9D.jpg Community FAQ The last thing for today are some of your questions (we'll do the riddle next time): Is PC your primary platform? Yes, it absolutely is our primary platform. Every piece of new content, every feature, every new bit of technology always gets into the PC version first. Both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 run only what already exists on PC. Ultimately any development progress made now is always implemented on PC first.  Should we be worried about DayZ being on consoles? No! Quite the contrary: we need to squeeze every frame, and every possible line of code optimization out of DayZ in order to make it run well on consoles. This massively contributes to the overall improvements of the PC build. Exploring new platforms with DayZ also opens more possibilities to cooperate with different partners - if we did not make DayZ on Xbox, it would be harder for us to visit you in person or events, for example.  Is it going to slow down PC development? No! Remember, PC development is console development. It's not two different things. There is, of course, some amount of work associated with specific platform support and bug fixing, mostly in programming and QA, but we're not taking the time of any developers that are critical for reaching our Experimental, Stable and 1.0 goals for PC.  And that is all from me today. Don't forget to send us your videos, pictures and everything DayZ related you've made, because we love it! Header picture by Lith3on Baty/Community Manager  ",

        "contents": "<strong>Update: </strong>Bohemia PR manager clarified the DayZ engine situation in an email, saying that the studio has been reworking the technology for the past four years. &quot;It&#x2019;s basically the reason why we are in Early Access for so long,&quot; he said. &quot; Bohemia started a development of a new Enfusion Engine along with DayZ standalone&#x2014;an engine that&#x2019;s meant to empower our future games.&quot; &quot;The upcoming PC 0.63 Experimental update is going to introduce a sizeable chunk of these long-awaited tech changes that will have a massive influence over how DayZ plays and feels in general. So it&#x2019;s definitely a huge milestone for the game itself, as big as having almost a completely new engine can be, but relaunch is perhaps not the correct word.&quot; Culak added that the technological upgrade shouldn&apos;t impact the plan to launch the game this year. &quot;This has been the plan all along: DayZ beta (when our 0.63 update reaches &apos;stable branch&apos; on Steam) will introduce major tech changes that improve the gameplay, along with some new content and features,&quot; he said. &quot;The road from beta to 1.0 will be mostly about polishing those, balancing everything, and doing additional smaller content drops.&quot; <strong>Original story:</strong> Bohemia Interactive dropped some unexpected news about <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/day-z/\">DayZ</a> at a recent ID@Xbox event, telling <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dayz/dayz-new-engine-release-date\">PCGamesN</a> that the game is going to relaunch on a new engine in just a couple of weeks.&#xA0; &quot;We&apos;re releasing DayZ on a new engine in a couple of weeks on PC, and it&apos;s gonna be coming to Game Preview on Xbox this year,&quot; lead producer Eugen Harton said. &quot;That&apos;s basically our aim. I would almost say it&apos;s a reboot of DayZ on PC.&quot;&#xA0; DayZ has been in Early Access on Steam since 2013, and has actually been around for much longer than that, yet it was only late last year that Bohemia committed to a full launch <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/dayz-is-now-slated-to-leave-early-access-in-2018/\">this year</a>. Harton wouldn&apos;t say whether the shift to a new engine would mark the Early Access exit, although I have to think it would be kind of a strange approach to take: Transitioning to a new tech platform is the sort of thing I&apos;d expect to cause headaches, not clear them up.&#xA0; There&apos;s no sign of the impending engine change on Steam, but I&apos;ve reached out to Bohemia for more information and will update if I receive a reply.&#xA0; ",

Let's read more about our upcoming 0.63 public stress tests, our progress on Xbox, and plans for PAX East! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear DayZ players, There is a lot of commotion in the office as we get near our first 0.63 public stress test (which I will talk about more today and share details of why and how we are approaching this step, and what should be the outcome for both you, the players, and us - the developers). Besides the obvious focus to get things into public hands for testing, we are dealing with issues related to weapon collisions with environment and zombies. While also working on climbing and jumping to make traversing through the environment a much better experience.There is a lot to cover in the coming weeks, and we are looking at the missing pieces, as well as pushing for the level of polish we want to achieve before we finally move 0.63 to the Experimental branch of DayZ on Steam. 0.63 Stress Tests As we've mentioned during our 0.63 Dev Live Stream, the initial releases of 0.63 will take the form of time-limited, focused stress tests. To differentiate these stress tests from the more traditional Experimental testing phase, we'll create a completely new \"Stress Test\" branch of DayZ on Steam, which anyone of you will be able to switch to, and play on test servers provided by us. Once 0.63 gets ready and releases on the Experimental branch, this option will be gone, but we expect to have more than one of these stress tests happening in the next couple of weeks, so you might get a chance to hop in early and test the game in a limited capacity. Our main goal with stress tests is to test server load and see the number of players we can handle on one server. These stress test can both happen very often, or there might be some delay between them. We will be auto collecting logs and servers crashes for further analysis, as well as profiling the server performance. A big chunk of the work will go into making sure we get lots of data to sort through and evaluate. We will announce the time of each stress test on our social media channels so that you can prepare at least a little bit ahead of time. Besides the timeline of availability, we will try and provide you with a list of things that we've assigned the highest priority for getting feedback on. I know a lot of data miners are going to look into everything we've done with the game, as there is tons of work in progress features hidden inside the client data, possibly including some not yet covered details that may cause a little bit of premature excitement. While we totally expect that this will happen, we will be, however, pointing our focus towards a more limited set of things at one time in these tests. For the first test, we will try to take a close look at the new implementation of gunplay and player synchronization. You will be spawning in a much more concentrated manner on selected locations in Chernarus, already equipped with basic gear that we have ready for testing. Many things in those builds will still be either disabled completely or not spawning. On the other hand, we will try and increase the player numbers per server to see how far we can go. It's going to be a bit of a bloodbath, that's for sure! For the first bunch of stress tests, there will be a limited time window, with a limited number of items spawning, and also with a somewhat limited functionality so that the data we are collecting is helpful. We are at a point where we need your help, your feedback. It's necessary for us to move forward, and to make sure that when the game goes live for everybody, it’s as consistent and reliable as it can get. For now, there will be broken animations, bugs and different annoying details that we know about. However, I cannot state how important for us it is to start testing now, and not wait any longer. Some of the issues we might encounter will take some time to solve, and will only be able to be reproduced in the high traffic environment of public testing. Now to answer the question why we do so with a limited feature set and in a limited time window: any data collection past the initial findings and blockers is diluting the effectiveness of such efforts. Problems can be hiding in layers - as you fix one, another appears because with the first problem in its way, it never had a chance to occur. We think we know about a lot of them - if not most - but we realize there is more to do. It's going to be fun either way - we are ready to face this head on, and roll fixes in quickly. Ramping up our communication both ways is an important part of the process that's coming both during stress tests and in Experimental. For feedback, videos are one of the best mediums for us to understand what’s happening, so if you have a chance to share them with us on the Feedback Tracker and the DayZ forums, they are more than welcome! We'll talk about this when we release the notes for each stress tests, but as mentioned, we will mostly be looking for inconsistencies in player movement and gunplay. You'll definitely experience a lot of weird inconsistencies or bugs with things like melee, environment actions, or crafting, but we're working on those, and these just require time, but meanwhile, we can already run tests on those focus areas that will help us move forward faster. As for when do we start those stress tests - again, as mentioned in the Live Stream, we were looking at the initial releases of 0.63 as something that's weeks, not months away. It's been two weeks since the Live Stream now, and so it goes without saying that we'll all get to some testing rather soon! Keep following us on Twitter, Facebook, and our Forums to be notified when a stress test goes online! - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Filip Hi all! Over the course of the last couple of weeks, we have worked on several smaller tasks and features such as swimming, footsteps in water, ladder climbing, user action and fireplace sounds. We've also finished the work on the interior controller for weapons and character sound. Now we can have different tails for indoor shooting, reloading magazines of footsteps. Indoor ambient sounds are still in progress. For next few weeks, we will be focusing on melee fight. We will re-design sounds for attack animations and also make many new melee hit sounds. https://youtu.be/s_jVKGVzOmM - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors, In case you haven't noticed, we skipped the last Status Report and we broadcasted a Live Stream of the 0.63 build instead, with dev commentary. And we are really happy with your feedback, thank you for that! We are improving our streaming skills and we are hoping to stream more often in future, to share our DayZ development goals with you! If you missed the stream, we exported it to our YouTube channel and you can watch it here: https://youtu.be/-RmJrnp85K0 Part of our team was attending GDC last week, where we've met with a bunch of journalists at a closed event organized by ID@Xbox - to all of them, we've presented a short Staroye DEMO of DayZ on Xbox One.

I chose the three hottest ones: Are you developing DayZ for Xbox One X only? No, we’ll be releasing on all Xbox One consoles, and on PlayStation 4 as well! How about the frame rates on Xbox One X? It’s all work in progress, but we’re already peaking at 50-60 FPS in 1080p on Xbox One X, and we plan to support 4K@30 FPS. We’ll see where we end up though! Will there be cross-platform between platforms? That’s unlikely - while it’s perfectly viable from the technology perspective, we’d rather not mix PC and console players because it would cause a noticeable disbalance in gameplay. Let's check out the content you have done since the last Status Report. There is a lot of it, so I had to choose just some of the things you sent me.

You need to see it! https://youtu.be/g-X3RMdartg  I saw a picture on Twitter that made me hungry. And I hope it will make you hungry too. This amazing package was sent by PetitPoney to his DayZ friends. Looks like human meat, doesn't it? I asked the recipient EVILZ if he likes human meat so much, and he replied to me that it is just pork meat and he made a backpack from its skin.

        "contents": "One day last week I became curious about how development of DayZ was coming along&#x2014;despite the game being near and dear to my heart, it&apos;s sort of slipped off my radar recently&#x2014;and wouldn&apos;t you know it, the developers hosted a livestream on that very same day. During the stream, they demonstrated and discussed some of the changes that will be coming to the open-world multiplayer survival game in version 0.63.&#xA0; A few minutes into the stream, however, the devs broke my heart by showing off a new sprint meter. I should explain that I have a <em>bit</em> of a problem with sprint meters in open world games, so much so that <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/sprint-meters-in-open-world-games-suck-and-heres-how-to-fix-them/\">I once griped about them at length</a>. I know it&apos;s not realistic for characters to be able to run endlessly, but I think every player has a different line where realism begins to interfere with enjoyment. For me, that line is squarely on the sprint meter. I hate them. I think slowing players down is anti-fun. I even lauded DayZ in that very article for not having one: &quot;...I fondly recall that let me run at top speed across the map for as long as I liked. At the same time, it didn&#x2019;t treat me as superhuman. After a long run, it would take some time to have steady aim because my character was out of breath. This system allowed me to get where I wanted to go as fast as I could, but when I got there I&#x2019;d have to deal with the consequences of my marathon.&quot; I guess I&apos;ll have to revise that article once the new meter appears in the game. You can see a recording of the developer stream below, with the sprint meter discussion beginning around three minutes in, followed by two hours of them talking about other new features that I didn&apos;t watch because I was so upset about the sprint meter. I should probably note that I no longer play DayZ, because I once wrote an article for <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> with the premise that I would play the game using not just permadeath but <em>perma</em>-permadeath, meaning that if my character died during that session, I would never play it again in my actual lifetime. Naturally, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/10/23/dayz-permadeath-dairy/\" target=\"_blank\">I died more or less immediately</a> and have done my best to honor my incredibly stupid promise: apart from taking video of myself <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/chopping-down-trees-in-survival-games-ranked-from-worst-to-least-worst/\">chopping down a tree for this piece</a>, and one other time to get a specific screenshot of something, I haven&apos;t played DayZ since. That essentially means I have <em>absolutely no stake</em> in whether or not DayZ has a sprint meter. But I love DayZ and I hate sprint meters, so I did what I always do when I have a question about DayZ: I sent a message to DayZ&apos;s creative director, Brian Hicks, on Twitter. Technically, I just started wailing like an infant. Thankfully, Mr. Hicks can recognize a professionally phrased and well-thought out query (three frowny faces is an industry standard for signaling deep concern), and was nice enough to answer my questions about the sprint meter in DayZ. (My first question was literally &quot;NOOOOO WHYYYYYY.&quot; I&apos;m not joking, that&apos;s what it was. I am a giant baby.) After hearing Hicks&apos; reasoning for adding the sprint meter, I definitely understand what the devs are thinking, yet I still can&apos;t quite get on board with the idea. The logic boils down to a few points. Running speed in DayZ is already very fast When compared to the DayZ mod, the running speed in standalone DayZ is almost twice as fast, according to Hicks.&#xA0;He also explained that jogging (which doesn&apos;t drain your sprint meter) is still pretty fast, too: &quot;...while at first blush you might think will be a pain,&quot; Hicks wrote, &quot;in reality the jog speed (what you slow down to after depleting stamina while doing a dead sprint) is actually still pretty quick.&quot; I guess my counter-argument here isn&apos;t a great one, but here it is anyway: I like how fast the running speed is. And, as fast as it is, it still feels like it takes a long time to get from place to place because the map is so darn large. Sprinting is meant for escaping &quot;The stamina bar is essentially a resource you can burn through when you need to escape quickly,&quot; wrote Hicks. &quot;Much like in real life per say&#x2014;when that sucker is full and you run you&apos;ll be doing a flat out sprint&#x2014;when it&apos;s depleted, you are doing a jog (which again is actually pretty quick and I believe fairly close to the DayZ mod&apos;s default run speed).&quot; That&apos;s fine, but I feel like when running around in a game, I&apos;m typically going to want to be running as fast as possible at all times. In Skyrim, in Far Cry, in pretty much anything, really: if I&apos;m moving, it&apos;s going to be at top speed. Always. A sprint meter isn&apos;t something I will save up for certain situations, which is why I prefer there to be no meter at all. They want you to manage the weight of your gear &quot;In addition,&quot; Hicks wrote, &quot;we wanted weight to be a consideration (but not a huge thing you have to micromanage). So, the stamina bar capacity is affected by how much you are carrying. Someone who selects a light kit obviously has more stamina than say someone who has a big ass coyote pack full of beans.&quot; Again, I feel like DayZ already did a pretty good job making you deliberate over what to carry and what to leave behind. It&apos;s got a pretty restrictive inventory, especially at the start of a new character, and even later with some of the bigger packs. Inventory management, even though it wasn&apos;t based on weight, almost felt like it <em>was </em>because you couldn&apos;t really carry much until you were completely kitted out with packs and vests and stuff, and even then I found myself spending a lot of time mulling over what to take and what to ditch. They want you to be careful Hicks continued: &quot;And of course, soft skills and more careful decisions with your character being intended to give more value to the character itself so players don&apos;t just give up and respawn when someone takes their loot from them.&quot; I feel like making careful decisions was already pretty adequately handled by DayZ, because it was <em>DayZ</em>, a game where you can be shot dead in an instant, or captured and tortured, or stripped of all your possessions and have to start over from scratch after hours of progress. Are people not careful? I&apos;m careful. Except for that one time I really needed to be careful, I&apos;m always careful. Modders may be able to disable it &quot;Also,&quot; Hicks wrote, &quot;keep in mind a couple factors: 1) Our modding support is very low level. Mod authors should be able to disable this should they choose 2) This isn&apos;t final, obviously. The team will be keeping a close eye on how it is received. 3) Even I was skeptical of implementing stamina&#x2014;but I can genuinely say I have had fun with it in. &quot; Despite all the solid reasoning, I have trouble imagining a sprint meter being fun. Perhaps tolerable, but not fun. Still, points one and two made me feel a little better about the whole thing. Maybe there are some players who really like the idea of a sprint meter being something you have to manage. Maybe (almost certainly) not everyone is as opposed to them as I am. Maybe I&apos;m making a bigger deal out of it than it warrants. Maybe it&apos;ll be just fine. And if it&apos;s not, maybe it can be modded out by someone who agrees with me. I can live with that. ",

We did our best to provide plenty of information about our progress and also detailed some design decisions regarding our damage system and ladders. Adam is also teasing some of the lighting updates he's working on, and to support all that, we've got a decent portion of visual materials this time - including videos! Let's get to it, Survivors! Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Players! As the iteration speed on many of our features increases, we are seeing some good results coming in - both in terms of features and stability. In the last two weeks, we have been focusing on and finished the below-mentioned functionality, and as of now, we are closing more issues than are coming in, which is a good sign. Ladders Mentioned before a million times, but it's finally working and ladders are done on the player side. We're converting data for all buildings and working on sounds for ladders. Swimming Again, something that has been missing from the basic movements of the new character for a long time, and it's merged in and done now. As is the case with ladders, sounds are the last thing being added at the moment. Unconscious state We are currently at the beginning of the polishing phase of all the animations and data and looking into connecting the state with character representation and shock values. Damage System (bleeding, penetration, ballistics) After merging in our first working implementation of the new damage system, we're finally working on tweaking the damage values and states, penetration and ballistics. Looking to polish it for experimental release. Bleeding has been connected to the system as well and is working already. We are fighting issues with particles and blood and trying to find a good visual solution. Jumping/Climbing/Bugfixing Since swimming and ladders are working technology-wise, we have moved onto the proposed jump and climb mechanic. Jump is going to get in first, and climbing - as it is quite complex - is definitely going to require a lot more polish. Stability The QA team just got back to work on the build stability. Our stability has been pretty bad recently, with all the large features getting in, so most of our team is focusing on bug fixing and it has paid off already. We're definitely not done and there is still tons of crashes to fix, but the stability has increased by a factor of 30 in just the last two weeks. And I look forward to a normal play session on 0.63 Experimental RC (Release Candidate build). User Actions Because everything you do in-game is working through user actions, we are getting the proper animations in, making sure that the base survival mechanics work, and that there is a loop to follow when you get into the game. It makes the gameplay much smoother. Weapons Work on weapons has slowed down because some of our team members were traveling, and also because we wanted to get in more of the melee combat animations, with the last changes in heavy and light attacks. The guys from the animations team in are in general working on making sure both one handed and two-handed attacks are polished and ready for use. Player turns/Prone We're looking into what's next for all the amazing features that the new animation system has brought us and polishing them, trying to fix both functional and visual issues that arise from the fancy and cool prone combat. 4K UI and bug fixing As we're working on expanding the usability of UI in different resolutions (including 4K), we have tons of bugfixes for inventory actions and visuals for icons, actions and a lot more. Making sure things work reliably with the UI is key now. Refactor of Infected Since a lot of the work on the player is getting done, our Lead Programmer Mirek is heavily focusing on a refactor of the infected, both in terms of stealth and combat. We don't want to promise anything, but we should hopefully be seeing the results soon, and build advanced features for the infected in quick succession after the basics of that work are merged in and working reliably. Collision issues Not much has changed here since the last Status Report. There is a huge pass on all objects in the game in terms of collisions for both gameplay reasons, camera, and much more. And since there are hundreds if not thousands of objects, depending on how you count some, this is definitely a long-term task. I'm very happy with the progress we're seeing and can't wait to play with you sooner than you think (wink wink). - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter In the last Status Report of December, I was mentioning ladders. Now you can check them in all their glory in the presented video (thanks to Adam!). You can see the animations for climbing up and down with normal speed, as well as quick scale up and fast slide down. Also note that climbing the ladder is being shown on one long, continuous, seamless ladder, with the possibility to exit and re-enter the ladder on accessible levels in the middle of the tower. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoCdj2Sxjmw Let’s jump to the ongoing work being done on the new damage system and ballistics. In the dark past, the old damage system used the so-called hit points (basically plain points positioned on a body, where the distance between them and the hit impact was compared in order to determine to which hit points the relative damage should be dealt). Now, in the new damage system, we are using hit zones, which are defined by meshes. That allows us to properly depict shapes of every desired component, leading to accurate hit detection and allowing us to incorporate terminal ballistics of projectiles to calculate the proper damage that should be applied. DayZ is an authentic game, and I’m convinced that range combat should definitely underline this direction. Hit zones obviously correspond with basic individual parts of character's body such feet, legs, hands, arms, torso, and head. There are also additional hit zones for vital organs - brain, heart, spine, lungs, and liver to deepen the representation of the character body. https://i.imgur.com/elPvV1D.jpg In real life, damage dealt by projectiles to the human body is very complicated and it’s fairly impossible to simulate it in game, so some necessary simplification is in place. Each hit zone has its own health which may or may not affect the global health of the character, as well as optional vital attributes. A player character cannot directly die just by shooting its limbs - our goal here is to avoid unreliable situations like shooting the character 10 times to its feet in order for it to get killed. However, as projectiles' penetration leads to bleeding wounds, the character will die indirectly by bleeding out without a treatment. Also, limbs can be fractured if their health falls down to zero, leading to restriction in character movement unless treated by attaching a splint to the fractured limb, which will heal it over time. On the other hand, damage the torso and head can lead to direct death (global health at zero), as well as indirect death by bleeding out. Vital organs have relatively low health, and destroying them leads basically to instant direct death, which opens a way to encouraging shot placement in combination with ammunition used, depending on current situation. https://media.giphy.com/media/3JSHfzUKwxdtH5x10r/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/u46iOyeTUCogsyUE9J/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/iOdudPHVoiSd8gSra2/giphy.gif For determining terminal ballistics, we have a complex set of parameters in place. Projectile speed and energy now depend on barrel length, which allows us to differentiate between different firearms using the same type of ammunition. Of course, speed and energy decrease over time with the distance traveled. Penetration also depends on the caliber of a given projectile, and obviously on the type and thickness of the material used. There will be a coefficient that takes into account how projectiles behave while penetrating materials, which will help us mimic such behaviors as tumbling, or expansion, of different projectile types. From all these parameters, impact depth and damage applied is calculated to be as close as possible. https://media.giphy.com/media/XKv5Bcb1tGJlc6i0HM/giphy.gif Now, to emphasize, I fully understand, that all of this can seemingly be perceived as somewhat mysterious behaviour, and could look like random or even buggy to observers, especially those who are accustomed to primitive damage systems where X hits from Y gun definitely leads to character's death. However, even with that risk, I want to give it a spin. Sure, it will be hard to balance and get it as right as possible, but hopefully, you will bear with us and at the end, you will appreciate the possibilities it opens. In worst case scenario, we will be forced, for the good of the game experience, to change it to a more streamlined approach, which will be more cleaner and understandable by yielding more predictable results. No mercy for what we are doing... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Adam This time, my contribution will be rather short. With the 0.62 update, we have introduced many changes to the world lighting configuration. With the upcoming 0.63 update, we have made additional changes to address: overall brightness during daytime dawn and dusk transition brightness issues improve nighttime and star read-ability Please note that following comparison pictures (0.62 vs 0.63 light config) are work-in-progress and do not represent the final state. It should also be noted that both pictures were taken on 0.63, which, compared to 0.63, also contains a number of colour improvements to environment assets (grass, vegetation, artificial objects).

For the last couple of weeks, we have been busy with ambient sounds. Though we're not finished yet, we've made some progress. Ambient sounds are more dynamic now and react to weather changes and location changes. We've also made progress with positional environmental sounds. Now you can hear birds and insect coming from trees and bushes, rustle of tree leaves in the wind above your head, metal squeaks and creaks coming from old building's roofs and much more. Here's a small teaser (please be aware that everything is very work in progress): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOZ5t7hSGy0 - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello everyone, let's start with answers to some of your frequently asked questions: Q: Will the cost of DayZ servers be reduced with the BETA release? A: Yes. In future, anyone will be able to host their own servers on their own terms, as we want to release the DayZ Server Files with BETA. Maybe not right with the first BETA build, but definitely during BETA. Additionally, we want to provide a Linux version of the DayZ Server Files, and that should further cut the costs of running a DayZ server. While we don't have direct control over the pricing offered by our selected server providers at the moment, the Linux Server Files should also lead to noticeable cost reductions with these providers. Q: Will the performance of the game be better in BETA or in the future? A:  Optimizations of performance in DayZ are a continuous process, but we can definitely say that the game performance in BETA will be better than the current performance in 0.62 Stable. How much better depends on specific hardware. Besides optimizations of the rendering pipeline, we have rewritten multiple systems to utilize more CPU cores, we've implemented double buffering for rendering and changed some of the synchronous operations to asynchronous (which allowed further parallelization of those operations). All of these changes have a positive impact on the framerate in the game, especially client-side framerate. Q: Do you have any plans for new buildings? A: Yes, we already have some new buildings on the Northwest Airfield in 0.63 and more buildings are planned. I would like to tell you an interesting thing that happened already a few months ago, but some members of the community still ask about it today. We've got in touch with the creators of a Norwegian political thriller TV series named Okkupert (Occupied) based on an original idea by Jo Nesbø in 2016. A lot of you already saw the episode September (second series) which had DayZ in it. In the episode, the Norwegian Police Security Service is using DayZ to infiltrate a resistance group and to gather some information. You can see them playing on PlayStation 4, however, it wasn't for real. At that time, it was still not possible and a lot of you were confused. Let's check out some screenshots I've made: https://i.imgur.com/frNyUcc.png https://i.imgur.com/ZD2lT1n.png https://i.imgur.com/DppisWP.png We know how hard can the current situation be for server admins and how hard can it be to keep your communities active. A lot of good servers died and we can't do anything for them now, but we believe (and hope!) they will be back after the BETA update. As I wrote earlier, with Linux servers, the rent should be cheaper, although we don't control pricing of the servers directly (that's up to server providers of course). I just want to thank all admins for being so passionate and for caring about the communities of their servers. Better times are coming! Artwork by Eightarmedpet. https://i.imgur.com/nQOvN0O.jpg https://i.imgur.com/CQWdKlj.png I found out some of you don't trust us about the Xbox version build. But yes, we are really working on the console version, on both of them - Xbox One and PlayStation 4 too. Here's a small teaser - hopefully, we'll be able to show them in action soon, as both versions actually run pretty smooth! https://i.imgur.com/DIjlGTc.jpg I have not seen such a well-done video for a long time. Uncuepa is talking about his vision of humanity in DayZ. He has a lot of interesting thoughts. What do you think about this system, do you like it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwZVvUF_5Wg  This video has improved my day. I don't know if the participants were forced to sing, but this is kind of a \"Chernarus got talent\" episode. I love it, thank you for your work DuckyFTW! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipkCtgAQvo  Creator of regular DayZ Spotlights Boydy interviewed our map designer Adam \"Sumrak\" Franců. You can find a small video sneak-peak of Namalsk inside and some info about modding and map changes. Enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1g3I75zXGk No cinematic video this week.  Plonker made this cute Cartoony DayZ Turntable and showed it to us on Steam. And I am showing it now to you. :) https://i.imgur.com/wv7dG5u.jpg And as the last thing, we have the riddle again. Who won last time? Jake Bryce Johny K $€i¥ablitz OriginalChaostica Vetovote CanisDirus  This time is it a location from Adam again. So, do you know where is this house located? Tweet it to us on our official Twitter account. https://i.imgur.com/GTJNHmH.jpg My part is so long again, but I am not sorry for it because it is from you and I love your work so much! - Baty / Community Manager  Header image by Krush.

Vital organs have relatively low health, and destroying them leads basically to instant direct death, which opens a way to encouraging shot placement in combination with ammunition used, depending on current situation. https://media.giphy.com/media/3JSHfzUKwxdtH5x10r/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/u46iOyeTUCogsyUE9J/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/iOdudPHVoiSd8gSra2/giphy.gif For determining terminal ballistics, we have a complex set of parameters in place. Projectile speed and energy now depend on barrel length, which allows us to differentiate between different firearms using the same type of ammunition. Of course, speed and energy decrease over time with the distance traveled. Penetration also depends on the caliber of a given projectile, and obviously on the type and thickness of the material used. There will be a coefficient that takes into account how projectiles behave while penetrating materials, which will help us mimic such behaviors as tumbling, or expansion, of different projectile types. From all these parameters, impact depth and damage applied is calculated to be as close as possible. https://media.giphy.com/media/XKv5Bcb1tGJlc6i0HM/giphy.gif Now, to emphasize, I fully understand, that all of this can seemingly be perceived as somewhat mysterious behaviour, and could look like random or even buggy to observers, especially those who are accustomed to primitive damage systems where X hits from Y gun definitely leads to character's death. However, even with that risk, I want to give it a spin. Sure, it will be hard to balance and get it as right as possible, but hopefully, you will bear with us and at the end, you will appreciate the possibilities it opens. In worst case scenario, we will be forced, for the good of the game experience, to change it to a more streamlined approach, which will be more cleaner and understandable by yielding more predictable results. No mercy for what we are doing... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Adam This time, my contribution will be rather short. With the 0.62 update, we have introduced many changes to the world lighting configuration. With the upcoming 0.63 update, we have made additional changes to address: overall brightness during daytime dawn and dusk transition brightness issues improve nighttime and star read-ability Please note that following comparison pictures (0.62 vs 0.63 light config) are work-in-progress and do not represent the final state. It should also be noted that both pictures were taken on 0.63, which, compared to 0.63, also contains a number of colour improvements to environment assets (grass, vegetation, artificial objects).

For the last couple of weeks, we have been busy with ambient sounds. Though we're not finished yet, we've made some progress. Ambient sounds are more dynamic now and react to weather changes and location changes. We've also made progress with positional environmental sounds. Now you can hear birds and insect coming from trees and bushes, rustle of tree leaves in the wind above your head, metal squeaks and creaks coming from old building's roofs and much more. Here's a small teaser (please be aware that everything is very work in progress): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOZ5t7hSGy0 - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello everyone, let's start with answers to some of your frequently asked questions: Q: Will the cost of DayZ servers be reduced with the BETA release? A: Yes. In future, anyone will be able to host their own servers on their own terms, as we want to release the DayZ Server Files with BETA. Maybe not right with the first BETA build, but definitely during BETA. Additionally, we want to provide a Linux version of the DayZ Server Files, and that should further cut the costs of running a DayZ server. While we don't have direct control over the pricing offered by our selected server providers at the moment, the Linux Server Files should also lead to noticeable cost reductions with these providers. Q: Will the performance of the game be better in BETA or in the future? A:  Optimizations of performance in DayZ are a continuous process, but we can definitely say that the game performance in BETA will be better than the current performance in 0.62 Stable. How much better depends on specific hardware. Besides optimizations of the rendering pipeline, we have rewritten multiple systems to utilize more CPU cores, we've implemented double buffering for rendering and changed some of the synchronous operations to asynchronous (which allowed further parallelization of those operations). All of these changes have a positive impact on the framerate in the game, especially client-side framerate. Q: Do you have any plans for new buildings? A: Yes, we already have some new buildings on the Northwest Airfield in 0.63 and more buildings are planned. I would like to tell you an interesting thing that happened already a few months ago, but some members of the community still ask about it today. We've got in touch with the creators of a Norwegian political thriller TV series named Okkupert (Occupied) based on an original idea by Jo Nesbø in 2016. A lot of you already saw the episode September (second series) which had DayZ in it. In the episode, the Norwegian Police Security Service is using DayZ to infiltrate a resistance group and to gather some information. You can see them playing on PlayStation 4, however, it wasn't for real. At that time, it was still not possible and a lot of you were confused. Let's check out some screenshots I've made: https://i.imgur.com/frNyUcc.png https://i.imgur.com/ZD2lT1n.png https://i.imgur.com/DppisWP.png We know how hard can the current situation be for server admins and how hard can it be to keep your communities active. A lot of good servers died and we can't do anything for them now, but we believe (and hope!) they will be back after the BETA update. As I wrote earlier, with Linux servers, the rent should be cheaper, although we don't control pricing of the servers directly (that's up to server providers of course). I just want to thank all admins for being so passionate and for caring about the communities of their servers. Better times are coming!

But yes, we are really working on the console version, on both of them - Xbox One and PlayStation 4 too. Here's a small teaser - hopefully, we'll be able to show them in action soon, as both versions actually run pretty smooth! https://i.imgur.com/DIjlGTc.jpg I have not seen such a well-done video for a long time.

Let's keep it short, and do some reading, survivors! It's good for you. Contents This Week Dev Update/Martin Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Martin Hello everyone! As Eugen is traveling this week, it's my turn to contribute to the Status Report (after quite some time), and provide some summary of the past two weeks in the DayZ Dev Team. With February in full swing, we're approaching the moment where with each week, the 0.63 experimental release is becoming more and more likely. We're about to start team-wide play-tests to get our internal servers as full as possible in order to get proper data on server synchronization and performance. With that said, there are still elementary parts (like swimming and vaulting) of the game that are very much work in progress, and for that reason, we are still not feeling very comfortable talking about any potential 0.63 Experimental release dates publicly. Considering some feedback we got under the last Status Report on Twitter, we've been looking ways how to still communicate the state of things more clearly, potentially as a progressively updated online task list. Together with Eugen and Baty, we've compiled a to-do list of sorts (basically our Experimental goals from the BETA Status Report) where we want to provide a simple overview of the current state of each key part of the 0.63 update. We'll check if and how we can publish it (we still need to work out some specifics with our team leads, also during the play-tests I mentioned), but suffice to say - there is a lot of work in progress, and less things that we would already be able to tick off as \"ready for Experimental\". While we don't want to give in to some unnecessary rush, there is also the other side of things that kind of makes us want to progress towards the 0.63 Experimental PC release as fast as possible. Our release schedule for this year is pretty tight. The main goal is to have the PC BETA and 1.0 all happen in 2018, and we're also getting much closer to bringing DayZ to console players. Our good relationship with both Sony and Microsoft opens interesting opportunities for cooperation, and since we've always had our focus aimed at the existing PC community of players first and foremost, it's in our own best interest to bring you solid PC releases ASAP so that we can also satisfy the large audience waiting for DayZ on consoles. Despite the not-so-huge amount of work going into our console builds of the game, we're basically able to run our regular PC 0.63 builds on both consoles with no major issues in gameplay or performance, and so the progress towards PC releases of 0.63 Experimental and Stable is critical also from this point of view - not only we really want you to have something to play already, we also want to grow our community further. Let's see how that works - we'll keep you posted! Meanwhile, see you in Chernarus! (Or on the forums, social media channels, and Reddit!) - Martin Čulák / Brand & PR Manager  Dev Update/Peter Our first working implementation of the new melee combat looked great, especially with predefined combos chained by attacks flying through the air. However, after applying a rule set to it and passing some internal play-tests, we have confirmed that it would be really hard to wrap our intentions of melee combat around these predefined combo attacks. As gameplay is the most important thing in DayZ, I don’t want to compromise on possibilities. Ideally, players should be always able to choose which attack option at hand they can use. Considering that predefined combo chains were composed of different attack types, players were not able to choose between light and heavy attack types. Since their order was firmly determined, it made melee combat feel like something that's a bit out of your hands, which made it less interesting in the end. We have decided to try one more prototype, in which the player is able to freely choose which attack to perform - a light or a heavy one. Immediately after the first play-test run, it was clear that’s the right direction to make the melee combat more \"controllable\". We will continue to iterate and improve the melee so that we finally arrive at the final implementation. It's safe to say that despite the shift from predefined combos, the new melee combat will still maintain visual variety in terms of movement, as there are still attack variations from both the left and the right side, and for both light and heavy attack types. These variants are seamlessly blended together, creating a continuous flow of attacks that simply looks nice. https://media.giphy.com/media/26DNcrh0VwthDJcDS/giphy.gif The infected AI that you know well from 0.62 and older versions of DayZ was kind of always limited, and it never met our expectations, nor came close to the behaviours we defined in the design team. Currently, the infected AI is being heavily re-worked, incorporating the new animation system. We are cooperating closely with our programming team to achieve all the intended features. The primary goal is to make the infected feel better on every level you can imagine. May it be more clever use of sensors to strengthen stealth, luring and aggro, adding search behaviour around the last known position of their target, or simply much improved readability of infected AI, utilising transitions like lost interest, target confirmed or target lost between their states. There are some significant changes coming to their melee combat as well, with jumping attacks making a comeback.  Don't end up feeding yourself to the infected... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Viktor Hi everyone. The entire team is still really busy implementing the remaining parts of our animation system overhaul, so today, I would like to at least quickly share with you a couple of fresh GIFs from the development. After receiving the implementation of the new ladder climbing from our programmers, we are currently applying some final touches to ladder animations and behaviour. We're finally able to enter/exit the ladders in a rather smooth way, and also climb and even slide down the ladder. There's still some polish and fine-tuning to do before we can make ladders experimental ready, but we're getting there! The team is also busy with weapons, player turn animations and unconscious animations: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7WIB0JFbvuw93cT6/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOwG5JhJiMJZzkEG4/giphy.gif - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Adam In this Status Report, I would like to talk about another map feature of the upcoming 0.63 update - Tourist Trails. The Chernarussian Tourist Club (also known short as КЧТ) is responsible for a wide network of the tourist trails in the Republic of Chernarus. In South Zagoria (province of Chernarus that we have in DayZ), they maintain roughly 200 kilometers of tourist trails. From the northern border mountains, through the central fields to the important destinations in coastal towns. Connecting many of the historic and natural landmarks, but also showing perhaps not often visited places in South Zagoria. All that to make your travels easier and safer. https://i.imgur.com/V2WMxTX.jpg The idea of having the tourist trails on Chernarus has been floating around since early Arma 2 days. It was brought up again at the start of DayZ development with more details fleshed out. But given the rapid iterations on Chernarus+ map, it was not really feasible to start with the actual implementation until the map was in a more stable state. With the release of the update 0.62 (which introduced a total vegetation overhaul along with the western border rework), we felt that the map has finally reached a somewhat stable state that would allow us to finally return to the idea of tourist trails. We have re-visited the original plans, made several improvements and re-designed the planned trail network to support all the map changes that happened over past couple of years. A result of this task is an overwhelming, 200 kilometer long trail network - so what helped us getting there? 4 different color markings to mark the trails you will find these on trees, rocks, poles,... https://i.imgur.com/ArPf07Q.jpg in real life, you would also find arrow versions of these markings, but to avoid too much duplication in data, we had to design every hard turn of the trail without the arrow markings.  93 custom directional crossroad signs tailored for each trail crossroad, any important place (stops), and for the start/end of each trail crossroad signs contain the local name and mark the crossroad's elevation above sea level (in meters) individual plates cover every possible direction you can take, along with the travel distance (in kilometers) to three following crossroad/directional/trail signs same as traffic directional signs and settlements signs, everything on these plates is written in Russian (Cyrillic) https://i.imgur.com/wQO6Dz2.jpg  2 types of the actual path models for the trails we use these models when the trail goes through the meadows, fields, and forests roughly 60% of the whole trail network is covered by these models - because as in real life, trails are also using the existing road network (excluding major roads so tourists are not in a danger of a serious car accident) https://i.imgur.com/uDAenNh.jpg  2 types of tourist shelters to make bigger trail crossroads more interesting and believable brand new assets that serve as shelter for players during rainy weather, or when you just want to get a bit of a rest before continuing your journey https://i.imgur.com/A70h764.jpg  In addition to these, we also have one other supporting asset that may or may not make it into 0.63: Map stands in real life, these are present mostly on major trail crossroads in order to help tourists to get a bigger picture and plan their trip we've got several prototypes so far, but still ironing out the best shape, size and the map coverage (if it will be the entire map or, for example, quarters) there will be a \"you are here\" sign on the map to help you pinpoint your current location Overall, tourist trails gave us a nice opportunity to improve our landscape - many improvements were done to it while the network itself was worked on. Additionally, it also gave us an opportunity to revisit all the locations names and make them actually visible directly within the environment. We hope that they will prove to be a useful feature when navigating through our 225 square kilometers of environment, and that you will have great encounters with other like-minded survivors there. We certainly enjoyed building the network and we hope that we will meet some of you there when this feature hits the live servers! https://i.imgur.com/goORUp9.jpg - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Dev Update/Filip Hi everyone! Over the course of the past two weeks, we continued our work on footsteps and cloth rustle sounds. It's kind of a tedious work because we have to implement these sounds into all animations - and the number of animations in DayZ is pretty overwhelming :). Another big task ahead of us is represented by an update of ambient sounds. We intend to create a more dynamic and realistic soundscape than before. We do not want to relate only upon flat 2D ambient sounds, but rather want to use as many positional sounds as the audio engine will allow us to have. Within the next couple of weeks, we will see how far we can push it! - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors! I would like to start a new tradition - answering some of the community's most asked questions in every Status Report and post it to a special thread on our official forums. So, let's check out what you want to know: Will DayZ be released on consoles? Yes, Xbox One version will be out this year in the Xbox Game Preview program. We are also working on a PlayStation 4 version and want to provide more details about that soon! Can you give us some modding tools already, goddamnit?! Not right now, we can't. There are ultimately two main reasons for that: we're simply not ready to legitimately support modding until we have a solid foundation in what is a game functional on an elementary level. We also need that game to be in YOUR hands and we need you to be able to run your own servers. That will not happen before 0.63 hits Stable. In addition to that, we're also still evaluating how far along will DayZ be moddable, and how we can best support modders with all the necessary modding tools. How long do we need to wait for the 0.63 Experimental? We want to play it so bad! I know, we want to let you play it too! Right now though, it just really needs more love from the DayZ Dev Team. It's not fun to play yet. All the teams are working like devils now, trust me - I am sitting right next to them in the office, I can see it all happening and I want to play it with the community as bad as everyone. But 0.63 still needs more time!  Yes, the base building is also not ready yet but we know how much you are looking forward to trying it. An example is Axel, who made this cool base building concept. https://youtu.be/CL2b9Wn2TUo  We have a DayZ Tip by NomadGaming. We know vehicles are sometimes pain in the ass in the current version, and you can get them stuck pretty easily. But don't forget - if you can't unstuck them, just destroy them with a matchbox, and they are going to re-spawn! https://youtu.be/5LzixUw2eI4  We had Gaming Roach Entertainment here before and they are back with another cool cinematic. It is a story about mother who wants to protect her daughter from dangerous people in every way she can. Another good job Gaming Roach, you amazed me again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCIIvNcP5U  What about some DayZ in real life?

The team is also busy with weapons, player turn animations and unconscious animations: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7WIB0JFbvuw93cT6/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOwG5JhJiMJZzkEG4/giphy.gif - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Adam In this Status Report, I would like to talk about another map feature of the upcoming 0.63 update - Tourist Trails. The Chernarussian Tourist Club (also known short as КЧТ) is responsible for a wide network of the tourist trails in the Republic of Chernarus. In South Zagoria (province of Chernarus that we have in DayZ), they maintain roughly 200 kilometers of tourist trails. From the northern border mountains, through the central fields to the important destinations in coastal towns. Connecting many of the historic and natural landmarks, but also showing perhaps not often visited places in South Zagoria. All that to make your travels easier and safer. https://i.imgur.com/V2WMxTX.jpg The idea of having the tourist trails on Chernarus has been floating around since early Arma 2 days. It was brought up again at the start of DayZ development with more details fleshed out. But given the rapid iterations on Chernarus+ map, it was not really feasible to start with the actual implementation until the map was in a more stable state. With the release of the update 0.62 (which introduced a total vegetation overhaul along with the western border rework), we felt that the map has finally reached a somewhat stable state that would allow us to finally return to the idea of tourist trails. We have re-visited the original plans, made several improvements and re-designed the planned trail network to support all the map changes that happened over past couple of years. A result of this task is an overwhelming, 200 kilometer long trail network - so what helped us getting there? 4 different color markings to mark the trails you will find these on trees, rocks, poles,... https://i.imgur.com/ArPf07Q.jpg in real life, you would also find arrow versions of these markings, but to avoid too much duplication in data, we had to design every hard turn of the trail without the arrow markings.  93 custom directional crossroad signs tailored for each trail crossroad, any important place (stops), and for the start/end of each trail crossroad signs contain the local name and mark the crossroad's elevation above sea level (in meters) individual plates cover every possible direction you can take, along with the travel distance (in kilometers) to three following crossroad/directional/trail signs same as traffic directional signs and settlements signs, everything on these plates is written in Russian (Cyrillic) https://i.imgur.com/wQO6Dz2.jpg  2 types of the actual path models for the trails we use these models when the trail goes through the meadows, fields, and forests roughly 60% of the whole trail network is covered by these models - because as in real life, trails are also using the existing road network (excluding major roads so tourists are not in a danger of a serious car accident) https://i.imgur.com/uDAenNh.jpg  2 types of tourist shelters to make bigger trail crossroads more interesting and believable brand new assets that serve as shelter for players during rainy weather, or when you just want to get a bit of a rest before continuing your journey https://i.imgur.com/A70h764.jpg  In addition to these, we also have one other supporting asset that may or may not make it into 0.63: Map stands in real life, these are present mostly on major trail crossroads in order to help tourists to get a bigger picture and plan their trip we've got several prototypes so far, but still ironing out the best shape, size and the map coverage (if it will be the entire map or, for example, quarters) there will be a \"you are here\" sign on the map to help you pinpoint your current location Overall, tourist trails gave us a nice opportunity to improve our landscape - many improvements were done to it while the network itself was worked on. Additionally, it also gave us an opportunity to revisit all the locations names and make them actually visible directly within the environment. We hope that they will prove to be a useful feature when navigating through our 225 square kilometers of environment, and that you will have great encounters with other like-minded survivors there. We certainly enjoyed building the network and we hope that we will meet some of you there when this feature hits the live servers! https://i.imgur.com/goORUp9.jpg - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Dev Update/Filip Hi everyone! Over the course of the past two weeks, we continued our work on footsteps and cloth rustle sounds. It's kind of a tedious work because we have to implement these sounds into all animations - and the number of animations in DayZ is pretty overwhelming :). Another big task ahead of us is represented by an update of ambient sounds. We intend to create a more dynamic and realistic soundscape than before. We do not want to relate only upon flat 2D ambient sounds, but rather want to use as many positional sounds as the audio engine will allow us to have. Within the next couple of weeks, we will see how far we can push it! - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors! I would like to start a new tradition - answering some of the community's most asked questions in every Status Report and post it to a special thread on our official forums. So, let's check out what you want to know: Will DayZ be released on consoles? Yes, Xbox One version will be out this year in the Xbox Game Preview program. We are also working on a PlayStation 4 version and want to provide more details about that soon! Can you give us some modding tools already, goddamnit?! Not right now, we can't. There are ultimately two main reasons for that: we're simply not ready to legitimately support modding until we have a solid foundation in what is a game functional on an elementary level. We also need that game to be in YOUR hands and we need you to be able to run your own servers. That will not happen before 0.63 hits Stable. In addition to that, we're also still evaluating how far along will DayZ be moddable, and how we can best support modders with all the necessary modding tools. How long do we need to wait for the 0.63 Experimental? We want to play it so bad! I know, we want to let you play it too! Right now though, it just really needs more love from the DayZ Dev Team. It's not fun to play yet. All the teams are working like devils now, trust me - I am sitting right next to them in the office, I can see it all happening and I want to play it with the community as bad as everyone. But 0.63 still needs more time!  Yes, the base building is also not ready yet but we know how much you are looking forward to trying it. An example is Axel, who made this cool base building concept. https://youtu.be/CL2b9Wn2TUo  We have a DayZ Tip by NomadGaming. We know vehicles are sometimes pain in the ass in the current version, and you can get them stuck pretty easily. But don't forget - if you can't unstuck them, just destroy them with a matchbox, and they are going to re-spawn! https://youtu.be/5LzixUw2eI4  We had Gaming Roach Entertainment here before and they are back with another cool cinematic. It is a story about mother who wants to protect her daughter from dangerous people in every way she can. Another good job Gaming Roach, you amazed me again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCIIvNcP5U  What about some DayZ in real life? BarelyInfected has done a short video, it is nice to see his face again! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtJO6MYZug8  Do you know RDiddy? He is the Australian streamer who loves jumping with cars in DayZ. This is the best jump he'S ever made! GG RDiddy! https://i.imgur.com/5JvrzLS.png  Let's check out some more screenshots. dayz_bron sent a beautiful screenshot to Reddit and I want to share it with you. https://i.imgur.com/ZCNajwv.jpg  Another amazing view from Green Moutain by DrDesync. Be careful, I was shot standing there like this! https://i.imgur.com/FMSncyk.jpg   And now is the time for your favorite riddle!  Who answered correctly last time?

Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Filip Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen When something ends, something else begins. As I mentioned in the Year in Review video, it's always hard losing team members, but it's a necessary part of the development cycle. Lots of people have joined the team over the last four years, growing from a strong core into a large, two-studio production with almost 80 developers full time. Some are moving on to new challenges, and I wanted to thank them for their contribution to what DayZ should be. A monumental undertaking that all these people were part of. My thanks go specifically (but not exclusively) to Andrej Sinkević (who is moving back home to take care of his family) for overseeing the creation of new weapons sounds, environment sounds, and making sure we are expanding upon the options available. My thanks also go to our Environment Designer Senchi for making Chernarus exciting again, for his passion, for thinking outside the box and for trying new things. At the same time, I would like to introduce Filip Čenžák, who will be taking over the DayZ responsibilities in our Audio Department, and will be sharing what's coming here in Status Reports :). Good luck, Filip! Even though we've said a couple of good-byes early this year, the work hasn't stopped and we have progressed significantly. So let me go over the updates that we have seen on our internal build - there are some exciting things we have been working on: Prone Combat We've had a prone review meeting last week in order to look over what's next for the feature, and we have started tweaking the turn animations and bugs with collisions in different parts of the prone animation. Ladder climbing Right now, we're working on a script implementation to make ladders available ingame, as most of the stuff is almost ready. We will definitively come back and check the data and overall ladder setup again once this part of the game becomes testable. Melee Combat Another iteration of melee combat is now available in-game, with new heavy and light attack modes, new evades, bug fixes for targeting, and animations for melee with ranged weapons - those are ready to get into the animation graph for quick tests. Dynamic Spawning We are trying to unify the spawning in-game to use one spawn function, and we're refactoring dynamic ambient spawning system for specific situations around the player. Peter shares more about this in his part. Vehicles Work has again started on vehicles, as the Enfusion Engine hierarchy for entities gets further in its development. Our focus is on the refactor with creation of locals pace, and real player character being in the vehicle rather than a dummy character. If you remember, there were issues like entering a vehicle and crashing, which would teleport you back to where you entered the vehicle, simply because the system didn't really allow for something being inside of a vehicle - it was all dummy characters and lot of improvised hacks. Camera The camera has progressed further through several bug fixes, and we are starting to go through ingame data and collisions to fix objects with wrong collisions, which of course benefits more features than the camera itself. The Infected We have finally started again the work on the infected, as the player character features are getting in better shape. Mirek has started a refactor on sensory mechanics, jumping, and combat, and we are going to have a longer discussion on our expectations tomorrow. Besides the specifics above, the weapon team is getting through the expected list of weapons for experimental at a steady pace, implementing the new features for every weapon, adding all the animations and making sure everything works as intended. At the same time, we have people tackling issues of the last inventory implementation or looking into the server browser back-end. And I'm going to shut up now and get back to work! ;) - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter Search for apples, now something of an iconic user action is gone forever. The same goes for every other search action present in the old DayZ! As you know, search actions were added as a placeholder to broaden the possibilities of survivalism, and promoting the hermit playstyle in terms of gathering food and other useful nature resources - may it be rocks, sticks or feathers. Driven by a random number generator, which I’m really not a fan of, it was nearly impossible to balance the outcome of these actions. They were open to abuse by limitations of the old animation system, and they also didn’t make sense from a visual point of view. Now, the part of Central Economy which deals with dynamic spawning is able to also spawn such ambient loot as apples, rocks or mushrooms. Dynamically spawned ambient resources are linked with static objects in the map, for example apples are linked with apple trees and rocks with stone paths or bigger rocks. https://i.imgur.com/ovGNGqz.jpg https://i.imgur.com/ZXnP5eK.jpg As mentioned these items are spawned dynamically around players, and they are capped from the side of a linked object, as well as by a total maximum amount available of that specific loot type (e.g. max 3 apples per tree, 100 apples total). Once a player leaves the area, ambient loot is despawned when its lifetime ends. Of course, as it’s part of Central Economy, it’s all properly synced, and all players will see the same ambient loot in any given area. Our solution is also friendly to server performance. I’m really happy that we were able to finally add such feature as it puts emphasis on our physical approach to design, and provides a more authentic feel to the overall experience. When you see it, you can take it... see you in Chernarus, folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek Hello survivors, not much has changed since the last Status Report. We're still dealing with pretty much the same tasks as last time, there's just one little change. We've started the work on improving the infected a little bit earlier. Currently, we're focused mostly on improving stealth mechanics, which means adding some new features for AI sensors and tweaking their parameters. Together with AI sensors, we're adding some new animations for movement. Here's a small teaser of three new movement variations. You can see that the movement is still not ideal, especially when the infected is making sharp turns, but rest assured, we will improve this - the animations are already prepared, we just need to spend time on the implementation. https://media.giphy.com/media/l1KcQGQ0kFBtfAhfG/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOwGmn7KEuMEbiL0A/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l0NgQbziD4ah4WfRu/giphy.gif - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Programmer  Dev Update/Filip Hi all, Filip here! As Eugen already mentioned, I'll be taking over most of the audio-related tasks from Andrej - and that includes writing the Status Reports for you! The sound department is focused on character sounds now. We could finally implement footstep sounds with the animation system as we intended. That meant creating a new animation event for every footstep in all animations. It took a while, but now we can synchronize footstep sounds with animations with much better accuracy. There are still some technical issues that have to be solved, so we hope that the programmers will find some time for us in their busy schedule. The second major feature we are working on now is attachment sounds. That means cloth rustle, backpack or weapon sounds when the character is moving. We have a working prototype, which will allow us to have different foley sounds for different types of clothes or other things you can wear. For example, it will allow us to have different cloth rustle sounds for shirt and leather jacket. In the final mix, the sonic differences will be small, but still noticeable and should create bigger immersion for players. - Filip Čenžák / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors, You are important to us and we are glad to see all your content. We don't want to keep it just for ourselves, so let's share it! Do you know BIBIX? He is a streamer from France and a true DayZ fan.

Eugen is providing a quick summary of our current production, Mirek and Viktor detail their ongoing work on the new player character (among other things), and Adam opens up 2018 in style with a major update regarding watercourses on Chernarus! As always, Baty closes with your community content - this time rather unsurprisingly focused on the bygone holiday season! There's also one song included, though. Let's go, it's the first Status Report of the year! Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen The year of DayZ is here, and the first two weeks of it are behind us. I'll be looking over the decision making and work happening during the recent ramp up, with the entire team fully focused on 0.63 Experimental build delivery. We looked over the state of the game more energised after the holiday break, and came up with a selected subset of experimental features that will get us to a playable game state as soon as possible. Even with this goal of fast implementation in mind, we understand how critical it is to, after all the time with legacy builds, get the game out in a good state. Making sure that the long standing issues that bother us all the most get fixed for once: performance, stability, cheating prevention, and functional gameplay mechanics. We are aiming for a good balance of polish and progress, but don't get me wrong: 0.63 Experimental and BETA are still going to represent an Early Access game, sothere will be issues. On the other hand, we will also work with a faster iteration speed to fix the remaining issues, to implement remaining content and features from our BETA/Experimental goals, and to go through all your valuable feedback. The past two weeks were spent on actionable items mostly within the player character feature set. I'll try and explain in more detail what are we dealing with right now: Polishing prone mechanics Besides waiting on polished animations and player prone turns, we still need to deal with limitations of weapon movement and ground collision. It's slick as hell though Tweaking the new melee combat prototype Moving to last iteration should bring us closer to final state and give us time to balance things out - damage and speed-wise There were some changes to control scheme and targeting options Implementation of Inverse Kinematics on player's legs Huge step towards a right balance of player turns Functional system that prevents extreme zig-zagging and visual fidelity of movement Cleaning up error logs Also looking into slimming the data and getting more order into current state of things We do come back regularly to clean up the mess in logs and error messages in order to keep them in a readable state Ladder climbing The nearest major step in the new player movement implementation Still needs more work on code, but script implementation is already waiting to be switched on Camera More details in Mirek's part There is a lot more work that has been done in these two weeks, but some of it is just at its very beginning. After we're done with the new player character, you'll see more stuff done on the infected side of things. The same goes for vehicles and helicopters - once they are working and we have them in some presentable state on 0.63, you'll be the first to know! - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Mirek Hello survivors, I'm afraid I don't have much to show you visually today, because a large amount of our work is still in progress. In any way, I will at least compile a short list of what we're currently working on in the programming team: Client side prediction of inventory actions this ultimately means preventing network lags when players manage their inventory the implementation is now done, we're fixing bugs that this change introduced in the game Player Character - Inverse kinematics for legs the implementation is almost ready Player Character - Movement on ladders work is in progress, we're hoping to show some visuals in the next Status Report Central Economy -  Dynamic spawn of items around players a system that can spawn items like stones, sticks or mushrooms around the player this is in a prototype stage we need to review the prototype with our game designers 3rd person camera collisions improvements in camera collisions prediction we're happy with the implementation now, but there's more tweaking to be done during BETA https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HUi8nLjz7dZ4Qg0/giphy.gif I hope you're not too disappointed for now, but I believe we're getting pretty close to showing you you more visual content in the following Status Reports, as we're making progress towards connecting new animations for the infected, as well as character's animations related to vehicle interaction. These will keep us busy in February. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Viktor Hi there! The animation department is currently focused on a couple of player character features. Last week, there was a small motion capture session where we recorded a bunch of missing animations for prone, combat, ladders, as well as first batch of unconscious state animations. Do you remember the prone GIF from the previous status report? Well, we have progressed with the prototype of this new prone behavior a bit. At the moment, the player character is able to turn on his back freely with every item, as well as aim and shoot with weapons. We have only the placeholder animations implemented at this point, so it's an ideal time to start replacing them with polished ones. The melee combat has seen some iterations and on the last week's mocap session - we have captured some new animations for this part of the game as well. Among others, we recorded butt-stock, bayonet, pistol and other melee attacks with firearms. We will work on these in the upcoming weeks. Our next focus will be ladders. We have adjusted the animation graph and prepared some enter/exit animations for that over the past couple of weeks. Of course, we also continue on weapon animations, as well as adjusting existing vehicle animations. The player character movement has received some love as well. The rework of turns is progressing well, with great results as you can see in the attached GIF. https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8JScrqClGSgL9S/giphy.gif We are now looking forward to the inverse kinematics on feet, which is being worked on at the moment by programmers. This will provide us with an additional set of improvements, and will take care of unwanted sliding that is still present during movement. https://media.giphy.com/media/l49JXtsD9FxoUdgEU/giphy.gif - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Adam If you have seen my Q&A video (Part 1, Part 2), you may remember that I touched upon the commonly asked subject of having actual flowing water in our environment. In our everlasting effort to have one of the most immersive game worlds ever created, I am proud to announce that at last, we've made significant progress towards having proper watercourses! Unless something goes wrong, this will be available for all of you to check out in 0.63: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IClZBVQ2lo0 Watercourses are really important to the landscape - simply because they add a sense to what we are trying to recreate. In real life, it is completely normal to go down into the valley and find at least a small stream or some kind of wet area. And like a power-line, a road, a railway or even a tourist trail, finding a watercourse can help you navigate within the game world. Will you go up against the flow, or down? The choice is yours. https://i.imgur.com/XDPnbVK.jpg The days of the legacy renderer and the limitations we had to deal with when creating other-than-ocean water are long gone, and with the recent engine improvements made, namely: Ability to have multiple water materials per map Ability to define wave animation using the flow-map Ability to have a floating water moss we can now improve the visual quality of our static water bodies, and also implement watercourses. We can now visually distinguish different water bodies on Chernarus (some can be dirtier than others) while still having multiple materials for watercourses. Our current implementation considers two types of a watercourse: STREAM https://i.imgur.com/6vxwBVB.jpg Narrow and shallow watercourse Used mostly inside small valleys They either connect to another stream or into small river SMALL RIVER https://i.imgur.com/QKswCwZ.jpg Wide and shallow watercourse Used in major valleys They form multiple streams and connect to the sea They have a name :) Since our game world is spread across 225 square kilometers, we have decided that our implementation has to be something we can recreate within such large scale. The approach is quite straightforward - we first prepare a stream/river bed by simply carving out the terrain where needed, and then we use different stream/river model parts (similarly to railways, roads) to fill the river bed with it. Some stream/river parts even have several variants with rocks and custom flow-map to simulate the flow of water around the obstacles, but we of course also focus on adding additional details around the watercourse when we feel it still lacks something. Stream/river beds also have a gravel ground texture (the same surface you have on the coast and is commonly used to collect stones). This implementation, however, has its downside to it as well - our terrain resolution of 7.5 meters makes some stream/river beds weird looking due to jagged edges. We try our best to mask it out whenever we can, but it is not an easy task. You may say, why not increase the resolution? While we would probably find a way how to make the 3.75 meter resolution working (performance wise), at this point in development, such detailed grid would end up not being used on most of the map anyway - terrain resolution often defines the way you design things within your environment (mainly when it come to hilly areas). We can't just go and rework everything again (just to utilize the existing option), so I feel like increased terrain grid would mostly be nothing more than an FPS sinkhole at this point. Also, I would like to mention the fact that there are no physical currents, dropping an item won't make it float downhill and given the shallow stream/river beds, do not expect an ability to traverse the map using some kind of a boat either. Most of the stream/river beds were designed in a way that you can traverse them without swimming, so it is up to you whether you cross (and get wet) or invest some time and find a bridge or a rock to take you to the other bank. https://i.imgur.com/QD7Mwa6.jpg We are in the process of evaluating the impact of watercourses on the navmesh (AI navigation), and it is also important to note here that at this point in time, the new player implementation is missing interactions with any water (sea, lake, streams...), so exact behaviour will have to be tested, but it is good that the watercourse solution is ready in data and environment, so it is something we can work with while implementing the interactions of player character and water bodies within the environment. We are also looking into further visual improvements to the way water flows/collides, and we're also adding local particle effects for smaller waterfalls, including some kind of audio samples to stream/river model parts. So, you may ask - when can we expect watercourses on Chernarus? Our progress in this whopping landscape task can be divided into four stages:  Analysis and prototyping of the watercourse solution Adding watercourses to the western areas of Chernarus Rework of existing old stream-like ponds network Adding new watercourses and connecting reworked streams (from 3rd point)  As I have already mentioned in my Q&A, western areas that have been reworked in the update 0.62 already have stream and river beds prepared (I am sure many of you noticed that already). This was really convenient for us, as we could use them to prototype best shapes for stream/river model parts. And it did not end just at the prototyping stage - I am happy to announce that 17 kilometers of watercourses have been already implemented there, and will be available for all of you to check out in 0.63. But what about the other points? We, unfortunately, cannot give you any ETA for that as of now. We do have quite extensive watercourse network planned and obviously, we would like to implement it over the whole landscape, but it unfortunately is not a simple task, and it's something to work on even after the 1.0 release. We will keep you updated on the progress though. These are really exciting times, thanks for reading and see you in Chernarus! - Adam Franců / Senior map designer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors! I am really glad for the amazing feedback we got from the Christmas update. You sent us tons of screenshots and videos with Christmas themes and I saw them all (at least I hope!). We decided we will keep the Christmas boxes until at least the end of January, because we know you like them a lot! Santa Joshua was in Chernarus and he had a bodyguard with him, just in case. Chernarus isn't a safe place to bring presents, you know: https://i.imgur.com/RZ8GgMi.jpg  Another Santa BrianM sends greetings from his travels through the post-apocalyptic world: https://i.imgur.com/0PxVm0L.jpg  And Miklós Tóth probably killed the Santa and took all his presents just for himself: https://i.imgur.com/BIkCH2L.jpg  We've found some beautiful New Year greetings on our social networks: This one is from Reddit user Wargasm011 - a New Year greetings card in Chernarus style! https://i.imgur.com/aeJ7FPP.jpg  Another one is from the French server The Team Onu. What a beautiful artwork! https://i.imgur.com/em9cGal.jpg  And here are two videos from your in-game Christmas adventures by BarelyInfectedand SepticFalcon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiqycvcA5yE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC0z05owRwo But Christmas is gone now, so let's check some of your best moments in DayZ. The Nomad Gaming is known in the community as a professional long sharp-stick killer. He put his best funny moments into one video, where you can see his skill, funny bugs, or how he trolls other players: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whTVve2z75w TopeRec made a best-of video from his stream again. He tried some role-play as Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead and it is pretty funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6cXFUWJQXo  Streamer M1nder became a hostage and someone tried to save him… but it didn’t go as he planned. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs7HuH7zS2k What about some real life things? Partypomcer has shown to all people from Reddit that he lives in a landscape similar to Chernarus (Northern Arkansas). Look at the barn in the distance! https://i.imgur.com/KhTrVLo.jpg  Tikacika sent us a new decoration he created on his wall. It is a vinyl DayZ logo and he made it by himself! Good job! https://i.imgur.com/XxP66Ch.jpg  And the last content from the community is a song! I love DayZ songs so bad, I have a list of them in my phone and I listen to them almost every day. This new one is called Hotel Chernarus, it was made by WiseManLofty and it is pretty cool, but we'll never forgive you the part about Adam and trees… ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVT15AnqeXU  Riddle time!

He tried some role-play as Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead and it is pretty funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6cXFUWJQXo  Streamer M1nder became a hostage and someone tried to save him… but it didn’t go as he planned. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs7HuH7zS2k What about some real life things? Partypomcer has shown to all people from Reddit that he lives in a landscape similar to Chernarus (Northern Arkansas). Look at the barn in the distance! https://i.imgur.com/KhTrVLo.jpg  Tikacika sent us a new decoration he created on his wall. It is a vinyl DayZ logo and he made it by himself! Good job! https://i.imgur.com/XxP66Ch.jpg  And the last content from the community is a song! I love DayZ songs so bad, I have a list of them in my phone and I listen to them almost every day. This new one is called Hotel Chernarus, it was made by WiseManLofty and it is pretty cool, but we'll never forgive you the part about Adam and trees… ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVT15AnqeXU  Riddle time! The answer to the last question was \"The house is between Stary Sobor and Rogovo.\" The fastest responses were from these survivors: Jakon72 Claire (Eclaire)‏ GriZz Daniel Leon Spencer R. A.

We tried to get it done sooner, but it&apos;s going to be 2018 folks,&quot; lead producer Eugen Harton wrote in a <a href=\"https://dayz.com/blog/status-report-28th-november\">status report</a> released this week. &quot;Both the beta update and any further 0.63 updates, up to 1.0, will happen in 2018, which is shaping up to be one of the most important years for DayZ. That is as much as we are sure of yet. I&apos;ll be honest, it has been a long wait already&#x2014;even for us&#x2014;but that&apos;s all we got now.&quot;&#xA0; Even when the beta does arrive, it will not be feature-complete. Harton described it as a &quot;platform&quot; that can be extended by both the developers and modders, &quot;an ecosystem where we are able to keep adding things and building the DayZ community from PC beta onward.&quot; He provided a detailed list of what content will be included with the beta release, and also touched on post-release plans, saying the developers &quot;intend on keeping DayZ alive for as long as it&apos;s viable.&quot;&#xA0; I would be remiss if I didn&apos;t side-eye the 2018 commitment just a wee little bit by looking back to Dean Hall&apos;s guarantee that the standalone release of DayZ would <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dayz-standalone-1/\">happen in 2012</a> (&quot;There&apos;s no &apos;we hope it is,&apos; it has to be&quot;), something that ultimately didn&apos;t take place until <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/day-z-early-access-has-200000-survivors-already/\">late 2013</a>. But does it really matter&#x2014;especially after four years of pre-beta?&#xA0; &quot;2018 is going to be an important year for us in the studio, as our long term work finally makes its way out there,&quot; Harton wrote. &quot;We sure take our time, but I truly believe that people only remember great games, and not how long it took to make them.&quot;&#xA0; The update also covers Bohemia&apos;s plans for the remainder of this year, and its goals for the 0.63 &quot;experimental&quot; build. A video summary, with more information and footage from the experimental build, will be released before the end of the year.&#xA0; ",

The last few months for DayZ has included a lot of review meetings. Both technical and gameplay design related - and now it's come that time where we have some solid information to share with you all on the upcoming 0.63 Experimental and Stable updates. Where we are with it, what we're looking at it being - and in short to offer some clear transparency to you all looking at it forward. Some of this information might be frustrating to read, and some of it might get your own internal hype train running. The important thing from the information we will be laying out today is that you all understand where we are with the move away from legacy DayZ, and why we've made the decisions we have. That said, I'll let Eugen take it away and guide you all through what we're looking at. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Dev Update/Eugen Hello everyone. Being candid is the core of the relationship we have as a studio with you, our community. That includes openly talking about things that we know will cause a lot of disappointment and negative feelings. I'll start right of the bat with one such thing: unfortunately, there will be no other major release this year (that means we won't be releasing 0.63 on neither Experimental and Stable branches). PLANS FOR THE REST OF 2017 & 0.63 EXPERIMENTAL GOALS I'm going to be very straightforward: along with releasing 0.62 Stable, it has been our main internal goal to get 0.63 Experimental out this year (as mentioned in Status Report on April 18) - we have put pretty much all our resources on that task, but as of now, we already know that the scope we will be able to achieve by the end of 2017 does not represent a full DayZ experience, and therefore blocks the 0.63 Experimental release.. Large chunks of the core gameplay loop are just now getting more settled, but there are still core features that are heavily work in progress, or not implemented - for example vaulting, swimming, and vehicles - and unfortunately that means that despite all the progress we've made on the other parts of the game, this is still not enough for a potential Experimental release. We do understand that all you guys want is to play 0.63 - and while it would be possible to have some Experimental 0.63 release this year that would be relatively stable and enjoyable for a short period of time, just releasing something is not a viable approach this time around. Both 0.63 Experimental and 0.63 Stable (= BETA) are key releases for us, as they are the last steps before we leave Early Access. And since it's so important, we have a set of so called epic goals that are implemented into everything we're making for the game in the new engine. These goals are: Performance Stability Control Balance We want to avoid any issues from lack of oversight in development or project architecture - for example we just want to make sure that our infected numbers and player numbers per server are as high as possible, and both DayZ client and server apps maintaining good, reliable up-time. To get a better understanding of what still needs to be done on our end before we can push the first 0.63 Experimental, read through this bullet point overview of our focus areas. All of the listed features are in different stages of development, and a team or person dedicated to its completion. These are the features we want to see finalized before experimental release.

Eugen is providing a thorough recap of our recent progress, we're introducing our scripter Boris Vacula and his work on particle effects, and Baty is announcing the winners of our wee Halloween screenshot contest! Let's dig into it, Survivors! Contents This Week Dev Update/Brian Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Boris Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Brian As we approach the entry into the BETA phase of DayZ's development, I am reminded of how things were back in 2012 as we worked on the original Survivor GameZ. Working with Dean to get us early access to upcoming builds of DayZ Mod, and trying to modify the script codebase to match the projects needs. Much like many mod authors back in the day, it was a frustrating experience, trying to create our experience within a framework (Arma 2 scripting code/commands) that was simply not designed for the type of experience we were trying to create. It is experiences like this that specifically has me so excited for what we'll be able to offer mod authors with DayZ. The project benefits so much from being developed in house by Bohemia Interactive - doing this on in house technology is such a rare opportunity in the grand scheme of things. For both us as developers, mod authors, and you all as passionate advocates of survival in a post apocalyptic world it means a technology base that is designed nearly from the ground up to provide the tools needed to create the experience we've all had our eyes on from day one. From a more modern and robust animation system offering true layered animations (being able to move and perform an action at the same time, yay!), to a renderer better designed for the large distances and huge amounts of enterable structures and objects drawn at one time, to a more robust and performance conscious scripting language. Making sure that when DayZ leaves principle development and the Early Access program that it provides people in the tradition of all Bohemia titles with tools to tell their own stories is 100% key. Another thing I wanted to discuss briefly was DayZ's survival mechanics - both in gameplay systems, and in the economy values. I've often received shouts of dismay from both sides of the fence. Things being too easy, and being too hard. Looking at the mechanics we have on the survival side, something we've struggled with often as developers is providing an immersive (sometimes punishingly so) sandbox that has systems that don't frustrate. Paying attention to feedback has been critical, and I don't quite think we've hit the mark just yet with this. Far too often, players are forced to manage survival simulation mechanics while trying to engage in the true draw of DayZ, the player interactions. Rather than the survival mechanics serving as a method to drive, and give agency to the player interaction. In addition to this, the idea of an economy of scarcity should give said agency to players engaging and interacting with each other, but far too frequently, it ends up being a drive to either completely avoid players - or to just destroy them on sight. I truly hope that as we move into BETA, and begin to see mechanics that give players more of an option and feel of having an impact on the world, that we see the core game loop expand past loot-shoot-survive. As my most memorable experiences in gaming all come from those types of interactions with DayZ, and DayZ Mod. To achieve this however, we need more than passionate developers. We need to hear from you all. Constructive, and engaging feedback on the systems and mechanics of DayZ that either drive, or hinder player interaction is key - and I hope you all will engage in this more often as we move into BETA. Utilize our official forums, open tickets in the feedback tracker - hell, even post on Reddit and tag Baty. This is as much your game as it is ours. In closing, I was asked by my partner once: \"If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, what would it be?\" - and I'll be honest I thought pretty damn hard on this one, but I am proud to say that my answer was a confident \"DayZ\" - and I hope to still be playing DayZ years from now. Allowing people to tell their own stories, and paint the world with their own brush will help make this a reality. Much like how development is far more of an orchestra, than one mans solo performance - a strong community is one that gives a voice to the ideas and vision of its members. Stay safe out there survivors, and remember: mo mic, no life! - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Dear Players, I'm going to change things up before we continue on our intentions and goals for release. We want to prepare detailed information in a digestible format as far as content and features go that will be available from the get go in the first 0.63 Experimental and BETA. I'm excited about how we can communicate with you in the future. Today I will focus on things we are currently dealing with, as far as the internal version goes, and its recent development. I do believe it's important to share the steps we are taking to complete this amazing gameplay experience that is so specific to DayZ as a game. Details are crucial in getting things right. And as I said multiple times already, there is only one way out of this: having a good game. Before we get into the summary, I'd like to point out we have released a security update on our 0.62 experimental branch. I know it might not seems like that important to test, but on the contrary: it's very much so. To increase the incentive on playing experimental servers, we have been discussing the possibility of making some small changes to how the game behaves, making it more interesting to switch between the branches and find a little bit of relief before the release of BETA. All ideas are welcome and I'll be happy to look into any feedback provided. From a gameplay standpoint, our focus is still on the player features that you might have seen on the DayZ Player Diagram a couple of Status Reports ago. The main issue we are still very much focused on is the fix for rapid zig-zag movement in PvP combat. We want to have a solution that is both visually appealing and on point when it comes to gameplay. Additional, we are looking into more tweaks regarding how the player camera behaves, and experimentation with its new features. https://i.imgur.com/gJApQN5.jpg Besides that, that are two major things coming to internal client that haven't been available in the Gamescom demo, just this month. One being prone ranged combat with proper turning on the back, as you move around with your weapon, and second the expansion on melee combat in the form of evades and blocking mechanics. Be aware that things can always change, but we are happy to start working with these as they get play-tested properly. I'm hopeful we can show some early prototypes soon and share the progress on these specific features as we progress further with their implementation. From a content standpoint, there has been a couple of sound recordings done and more work on the polish of the data gathered, as well as implementation of specific features that will enable us to fill the game with cues and sounds in right situations. Its an crucial stepping stone for bringing atmosphere and tension into moments and stories you'll experience in the world of Chernarus. Sound is not the only content we are working heavily on, as our firearms team continues to implement one firearm from our list roughly every two weeks. The list of BETA weapons should be covering various firearms across weapon types, their specific uses, their overall quality and more. We expect some changes to the pace of implementation as we add in more complicated firearm mechanics, but we are very happy with how things are going right now, and we will feel comfortable finalizing and sharing the list with you pretty soon. In the meantime, artists are looking into all the old assets used in-game, and reworking them into a condition that is fit for year 2017, and also fit for the options that we now have regarding the new renderer. Bringing the visual appeal of Chernarus into this century is the main goal here, as DayZ, while still pretty good-looking overall, is certainly lacking some more up to date finesse in certain places. Speaking of Chernarus, work on tourist trails is ongoing, and I can't be more excited after seeing the first internal results. It adds tons of flavor to an already interesting world. Adam will share more as we get closer to some final-ish state of things. Last but not least, as always, our concern is performance and stability, and we are going through bugs as they get introduced with new content or features. Its not something we take lightly. As you can see, we are trying to cover a lot of things that this game needs in order to introduce the critical changes all of us want to see. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Boris Greetings survivors! This is my first Status Report so let me quickly write something about myself. I've joined the DayZ dev team as a member of the Bratislava studio 3 years ago. Since then, I work as a scripter / designer and I wrote various systems (both on SQF and Enforce tech). Today, I would like to show you what I am currently working on in regards to firearms mechanics. Thanks to the new Enfusion technology, scripters now have better ways to handle particle effects. One of the features that heavily relies on this system are weapon muzzle flashes. In DayZ 0.63 and onward, all firearms will shoot unique particle effects depending on various parameters, such as ammo type fired, weapon type used, muzzle attachments used (suppressors, compensators, muzzle brakes or flash hiders) and the damage state of any of these components. In addition to that, particles can now be generated coming from multiple parts of the weapon. So for example, in addition to seeing typical muzzle flash coming from the rifle's muzzle, you will also see a patch of smoke escaping from the ejector. Or, if some specific muzzle brake is present, the flash will form a star-shape. Internally, we're currently at the beginning of creating particle effects for each weapon type and muzzle attachment configuration. This will be a long-term continuous process that will require a lot of tweaking to get right. However, we already have a few rough prototypes that we can show: https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOxeQmEzPodF9tuMw/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohs7Lj3ncglhhAije/giphy.gif This system will be fully moddable and with a few simple tweaks, content creators will be able to achieve quite wild results: https://media.giphy.com/media/26u4airPp0bHXzvY4/giphy.gif - Boris Vacula / Scripter  Community Spotlight Hello everyone in our lovely community! We are back after two weeks and you have created plenty of awesome community content again! If you read the latest Status Report, you had two chances to participate in some of our official community activities. The first thing was an event - The Big Pumpkin Hunt. 50 players split into 4 groups and were tasked to find as many pumpkins as possible in Chernogorsk. The only permitted way to fight was with bare hands and additionally to all that, there were creepy devs running around, scaring and killing the players. The event was quite successful and I am so proud everything was ready in time. I wanted to show you the kill log, but it has more than 5000 lines and I didn't have enough time for it. It should be ready this week though! The winning PINK team collected 80 pumpkins. Congratulations again! Fun fact for you - we have placed more than 200 pumpkins around all Chernogorsk in-game, all done by hand. The placement was not scripted at all! We had several content creators there and they have some screenshots and videos for you. TRMZ and CamCANTRUN made edits from the event, so you don't need to see the whole thing, just the interesting parts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMWWfN_pZMs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzGFzzUkvtI But if you want to see everything without any cuts, here is a Twitch VOD by McBaiin. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/186584993 And we need some screenshots of course. These are by Baroness from the Yellow team: https://i.imgur.com/XvKOpjH.png I really enjoyed the event and I am planning another one, so stay tuned and read the Status Reports for more information.  DayZ Noob has a community event for you, it will be a fist fight in Kamy and it sounds awesome, so check it out! https://imgur.com/TCLbp7ehttps://i.imgur.com/TCLbp7e.jpg If you have an event coming up as well in the future, just let us know via our DayZ Twitter or Twitter and we'll help to spread the word. The second thing you could have participated in was a Halloween screenshot competition. And you sent us tons of really amazing screenshots! I was sad we can only choose three winners. I collected 63 votes around the team and we made a decision. So…. The winners are: 1. DrDeSync https://i.imgur.com/6yDbIZa.jpg 2. PrincessRobotB https://i.imgur.com/vry7rpo.jpg 3. Tsch0sy https://i.imgur.com/Lf1KW9Y.jpg Devs chose DrDeSync's screenshot because of the story behind this picture. Group of survivors are resting peacefully around a fire, but there is a creepy killer hiding behind a tree, waiting for the right time to attack. I want to thank you all for your nice screenshots, I love all of them. Thank you! I will contact the winners this week  Now - time for more videos from you! This one is really great. TiKTac'tical made an amazing cinematic video. You need to see it. Really. Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwToNK5TvJE  Another video is by Axel Hjelmqvist and it will cost you only 1 minute of your time to see it. It is about morning routine of just about every survivor. Wake up, eat some food, drink some water, choose a weapon, kill some zombies and try to survive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u93xIitatOs  And here is an experiment! Rustycaddy made probably the biggest farm in DayZ ever! 10 random people helped him on a public server, which is amazing! Good people still exist. https://i.imgur.com/i06Q5O6.jpg  Do you know Boydy? He is a YouTuber from Australia and he makes interviews with DayZ content creators. This time, it was my turn. Maybe you will be interested. And thank you again Boydy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJf-SZuGzsE Here comes the riddle time again! First, the wall of fame from the last Status Reports riddle, good job: IMT THE MAX BRAND‏  Harold Palmer  The next riddle: Do you know the name of this camp? https://i.imgur.com/undefined.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/nUBQ0jL.jpg Answer on our Twitter profile and you can be on the wall of fame next time  And that is all from me, I am looking forward to see you in two weeks!

Eugen is providing a thorough recap of our recent progress, we're introducing our scripter Boris Vacula and his work on particle effects, and Baty is announcing the winners of our wee Halloween screenshot contest! Let's dig into it, Survivors! Contents This Week Dev Update/Brian Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Boris Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Brian As we approach the entry into the BETA phase of DayZ's development, I am reminded of how things were back in 2012 as we worked on the original Survivor GameZ. Working with Dean to get us early access to upcoming builds of DayZ Mod, and trying to modify the script codebase to match the projects needs. Much like many mod authors back in the day, it was a frustrating experience, trying to create our experience within a framework (Arma 2 scripting code/commands) that was simply not designed for the type of experience we were trying to create. It is experiences like this that specifically has me so excited for what we'll be able to offer mod authors with DayZ. The project benefits so much from being developed in house by Bohemia Interactive - doing this on in house technology is such a rare opportunity in the grand scheme of things. For both us as developers, mod authors, and you all as passionate advocates of survival in a post apocalyptic world it means a technology base that is designed nearly from the ground up to provide the tools needed to create the experience we've all had our eyes on from day one. From a more modern and robust animation system offering true layered animations (being able to move and perform an action at the same time, yay!), to a renderer better designed for the large distances and huge amounts of enterable structures and objects drawn at one time, to a more robust and performance conscious scripting language. Making sure that when DayZ leaves principle development and the Early Access program that it provides people in the tradition of all Bohemia titles with tools to tell their own stories is 100% key. Another thing I wanted to discuss briefly was DayZ's survival mechanics - both in gameplay systems, and in the economy values. I've often received shouts of dismay from both sides of the fence. Things being too easy, and being too hard. Looking at the mechanics we have on the survival side, something we've struggled with often as developers is providing an immersive (sometimes punishingly so) sandbox that has systems that don't frustrate. Paying attention to feedback has been critical, and I don't quite think we've hit the mark just yet with this. Far too often, players are forced to manage survival simulation mechanics while trying to engage in the true draw of DayZ, the player interactions.

To top it all of, Baty is celebrating Halloween with a screenshot contest and an announcement of an official DayZ Halloween Event! Sit back and enjoy the ride, you're in for a treat this week. Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Andrej Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear players! Since we have dipped into the topic of what BETA is the last time, I wanted to continue exactly in that regard with more information on our intentions. I have covered the process of how the server files and modding will be handled briefly in the last Status Report, and I want to talk about the process of getting from the Experimental update to Stable update in greater detail. There are tons of changes coming, since its basically a whole new game. But the core of what DayZ makes so special is never gonna change. The unpredictable human behaviour in large open world environment, where we want to see you go through both the hero moments, bandit life, or just being a Bambi lost in the vast of Chernarus. There are so many friendships I've seen happen in this game unlike anything I have experienced before. Stories that you remember for years, or action that gets your blood pumping like nothing else. But back to the topic at hand. Our goal with first experimental is to provide a meaningful experience. We will all let you know before it happens, and prepare accordingly with enough resources to handle the possibility of a large amount of people getting in. If need be, we will utilise Stable branch servers to offer the experience to the largest amount of people possible. The first Experimental build is expected to focus on some of the core systems of the game, which will include most of the gameplay that has been talked about. During this experimental period, we will monitor the player actions, gather feedback and iterate quickly on the state of the game. As said, not all BETA features are expected to hit the first experimental release and most will be introduced gradually before the version hits Stable servers. We are taking a safer aproach to scale the gameplay, and we will focus heavily on polish during this period. So turning on a feature, gathering feedback, polishing it up, rinse and repeat with the next thing. The features from our main features list that are rather risky for the BETA release include: helicopters shooting from vehicles bicycle/motorcycle barricading bow combat All are quite complex and have lots of trickle down effects on all sorts of systems, from persistence, to performance. We want you to keep that in mind for the first release, as we already know that we will be playing it safe to keep the experience intact. I'll keep you updated if anything changes. However, there is no change as to our intent of bringing these into the game eventually. Another part of road to BETA is content (that means weapons, for example), and as you might know, we have tons of unused content and things that we planned to add to DayZ over time. There is a selected set of content for BETA and I'll try and talk about the exact details in a Status Report as we have the content lists finalised. Rest assured, any content that we've teased at places like our Trello board will eventually be available in the base game, and it's our intention to release that content gradually utilising larger content packs. Backing up, we want you to know that we haven't forgotten about our live game (the 0.62 Stable branch), even if it has been sidelined to bring you this amazing new experience. We are still monitoring larger issues, and trying to keep things intact until BETA arrives. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Mirek As I promised the last time, today I would like to write about the background of modding possibilities in 0.63. I don't want to write about tools, which we will release, but more about what can be done with scripting. If you remember my Q&A video, I was talking about how the game is programmed on three levels - the engine (low level), gameplay systems (middle level) and scripts (high level): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC9myOfZQYA So ultimately, we can say that modding possibilities depend on what engine and gameplay systems we expose for scripting. And this (exposing systems for modification) is the major part of modding, which we're currently working on. With the power of Enforce script, which syntax is very similar to C# or Java, we would like to give modders the ability to not only create variations of DayZ, but to create some different game genreswithin the DayZ universe (with the basic premise of it still being an MMO) - that means things like a Fallout style RPG, isometric action game, or even a point & click adventure for ecample. As an example, we've added the support to create a game mode in which the standard DayZ player instance is not available. You can imagine yourself how this can be usable - to provide one example, we are using this mode in our internal scene editor, which is completely made by scripts. Of course, that's not quite simple and we have to think twice about exposing any systems due to security reasons. We know that when we release modding support, it's possible that some of the tech features required to accomplish the goal of making a completely new genre will be missing, so we're counting on the option to extend scripting interfaces even after 1.0 release. So this is it. Our goal is not only to create a moddable game, it's to create a platform where we provide as much as we can for all the creative modders out there. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Viktor Hi everyone! Today, I would like to show and talk a bit about progress in the animation team. We have put together a very short video showcasing some of the recent changes and new animations. Please happily ignore the sounds - we are working on that and our Audio Designer Andrej shares more on audio later in the Status Report. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJk_MMVr0Po Let's take a look at the video. In the first part, we can see various animations for weapons. The weapons team is now moving gun by gun, gradually implementing our BETA list of weapons into the 0.63 build. This includes, of course, some work on the animation side of things, since animations and also animation graphs need to be updated to make sure everything is played correctly. Each individual weapon has many detailed animations for all the situations that can happen. For instance, the FNX now has 28 individual animations. The most recent guns implemented on 0.63 include CR 75, Makarov, and the team is currently finishing the UMP 45. Another part of the animation team is focused on player locomotion. We are working closely with the programmers and designers to make sure player moves nicely and is fully responsive at the same time. The video can not really show how the controls feel, but compared to the old system, this is already a huge improvement (as some of you could test personally at Gamescom). We are trying to expand on the positive feedback we have received. We are adding player inertia and also bringing some visual improvements. One thing that is in progress at the moment is how the player character turns. We have come to a working prototype that everyone seems to be happy about and now we will implement it for every stance and item. Another change to the locomotion is related to how player walks and runs in different directions. We have reworked some parts of the graph and replaced it with different animations when going to the left or right. This allows us to have better control when players switch legs while changing direction. Thanks to that, there will be less or almost no clipping of the legs with each other. In the last part of the video, you can see some falling animations. These have been updated recently. We have adjusted each of the fall animation so it better blends and is more visible if you fall from big heights. In the next step, we will also update the actual landing on the ground. Landing from small falls will be rather a procedural animation in the hips and spines so that we don't take any control from the player. Landing from higher falls will be an actual full body animation. That's all from me today. I hope you liked it and I'll show you some more next time. Cheers! - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Andrej Hey survivors! It's been awhile since you've had an update form our audio department so here it is! Over the couple of last months, we have mostly been working on an entire new set of player sounds. With the introduction of a new player controller in 0.63, we decided to give our player character a massive audio overhaul. One of the things we are working on right now are the foley sounds. Just last week, we've visited our studio in Mnisek and recorded many types of clothing and various materials, which we want to use (after proper editing and processing) for different types of in-game clothes and gear audio. It will be a fairly complex system with separate sounds for different types of footwear, top and bottom clothing, but also backpacks and weapons. We are sure that more detailed and diversified foley audio willenhance the immersion and overall experience. You can watch a sneak-peak of our day in the studio in the video below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOnmGuhV-Pk A major part of player audio also consists of the vocal sounds. This week, we will be recording a completely new set of voices for our characters, with more than 20 actors scheduled to participate. Together with the recording of character sounds, we're also going to record some new sounds for the infected. We have been planning it for so long, and now it's finally time to do it! It took us a lot of time to synchronise our ideas with the gameplay design department, and as always, it was quite challenging to get support form the already busy programmers/scripters, so that we can achieve the best possible results. Luckily, we've been successful at that and the recording session can take place in our Mnisek studio, spanning over a couple of days and altogether involving almost 30 different people. We will surely produce massive amounts of raw audio material, which we will than process, mix and implement into our game. We will do some comparative videos so that you guys can see how we practically transform the voices of our perfectly healthy actors into the bloodlust infected inhabitants of Chernarus. There have been some questions as to why do we have some 0.61 sounds in our latest Dev Log video. Simply put, it was because our Gamescom build was internally on a separate branch, so ambient sounds were not merged there. The 0.62 changes will not be reverted for the 0.63 version, but they will eventually be improved with new sounds and a completely new overall audio mix - including new player and infected sounds, new combat sounds (ranged and melee) and also with a completely reworked vehicle sound system that is being written now. We will share more in the upcoming Status Reports - until then, stay tuned and see you in Chernarus! - Andrej Sinkević / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hey Survivors! It is my favourite season of the year - The Halloween time! In Czech Rep, we don't celebrate Halloween - we celebrate All Souls' day, which is not about costumes and pumpkins, and I am glad that we have Halloween at least in DayZ with the latest update!

To top it all of, Baty is celebrating Halloween with a screenshot contest and an announcement of an official DayZ Halloween Event! Sit back and enjoy the ride, you're in for a treat this week. Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Andrej Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Dear players! Since we have dipped into the topic of what BETA is the last time, I wanted to continue exactly in that regard with more information on our intentions. I have covered the process of how the server files and modding will be handled briefly in the last Status Report, and I want to talk about the process of getting from the Experimental update to Stable update in greater detail. There are tons of changes coming, since its basically a whole new game. But the core of what DayZ makes so special is never gonna change. The unpredictable human behaviour in large open world environment, where we want to see you go through both the hero moments, bandit life, or just being a Bambi lost in the vast of Chernarus. There are so many friendships I've seen happen in this game unlike anything I have experienced before. Stories that you remember for years, or action that gets your blood pumping like nothing else. But back to the topic at hand. Our goal with first experimental is to provide a meaningful experience. We will all let you know before it happens, and prepare accordingly with enough resources to handle the possibility of a large amount of people getting in. If need be, we will utilise Stable branch servers to offer the experience to the largest amount of people possible. The first Experimental build is expected to focus on some of the core systems of the game, which will include most of the gameplay that has been talked about. During this experimental period, we will monitor the player actions, gather feedback and iterate quickly on the state of the game. As said, not all BETA features are expected to hit the first experimental release and most will be introduced gradually before the version hits Stable servers. We are taking a safer aproach to scale the gameplay, and we will focus heavily on polish during this period. So turning on a feature, gathering feedback, polishing it up, rinse and repeat with the next thing. The features from our main features list that are rather risky for the BETA release include: helicopters shooting from vehicles bicycle/motorcycle barricading bow combat All are quite complex and have lots of trickle down effects on all sorts of systems, from persistence, to performance. We want you to keep that in mind for the first release, as we already know that we will be playing it safe to keep the experience intact. I'll keep you updated if anything changes. However, there is no change as to our intent of bringing these into the game eventually. Another part of road to BETA is content (that means weapons, for example), and as you might know, we have tons of unused content and things that we planned to add to DayZ over time. There is a selected set of content for BETA and I'll try and talk about the exact details in a Status Report as we have the content lists finalised. Rest assured, any content that we've teased at places like our Trello board will eventually be available in the base game, and it's our intention to release that content gradually utilising larger content packs. Backing up, we want you to know that we haven't forgotten about our live game (the 0.62 Stable branch), even if it has been sidelined to bring you this amazing new experience.

Eugen is following up doing his best to explain our basic goals for 0.63 Experimental and 0.63 Stable (BETA). We're also welcoming back our Lead Gameplay Programmer Mirek - after months of non-stop hardcore programming, we made him share some of the behind the scenes science happening under his watch. To close things off, as usual, we have Baty taking a look at your awesome community content, and in his short update, we have our Brand Manager Martin offering what could possibly be a dream job for many of you content creators out there! Let's get to it. Contents This Week Dev Update/Brian Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Brian Greetings Survivors! Apologies on missing the last Status Report - cards on the table, I knew the rest of the team had strong detailed info for you all and I didn't want to keep rehashing my sentiments on public development, or how big the move into BETA is for DayZ as a product. In the case of the last Status Report, I think the video said a lot more than anything I could type. Most of what you end up reading from me at this point in the project is related to postulation, concepts, and struggles and I'm honestly not certain that most of you are interested in that. We're at a stage where I feel like so many people out there are just holding their breath, waiting to get their hands on the first BETA builds and see for themselves how big the change is. Hell, I think I'm right there with you all on that. Back in the summer of 2013 when Dean, Matt, and I were stuck in a tiny room above a laundry room out in Mnisek, we were whiteboarding key elements we thought DayZ should improve on the gameplay of the mod (beyond the obvious). A good deal of what was prototyped over 2014, and 2015 came from those whiteboard meetings. I remember very clearly sitting down with Dean thinking on how we could improve the fresh spawned players chances to survive without basic weapons, as the desire was to make DayZ an experience similar to the novel \"The Road\" - which is where \"punching\" came in to play. (I distinctly remember Dean asking me if I thought it would make fresh spawns even more of a threat, and thus have a higher mortality rate when encountering skittish geared players - clearly I was wrong in dismissing this). I'm rambling, but the point I'm trying to make is there is so much that the team, myself, Peter, have worked on throughout the years that just couldn't be done within the limitations that RV offered us - and it killed me to know time and time again that after documenting, and prototyping portions of the key design of what DayZ is to be that we were time and time again limited by the technology that DayZ originally steam with. I can't emphasize enough to you all how insanely fortunate DayZ, and the DayZ dev team have been to have a company behind us that believes in the vision we set forth at the start of development to reach. So many titles I've worked on, or along side the development of have just had core mechanics, and feature sets lopped off with a hatchet in order to reach a set shelf date - never to reach their original full vision. It might be irritating to some out there in the user base, but the fact that we haven't had to sacrifice any of the core gameplay features yet is massive. That said, one of the things Dean and I used to stress early on was that DayZ was not just a platform for people to create their own stories - but that like so many Bohemia titles before it, it is a platform for people to create their own vision of the apocalypse (or anything else that strikes their fancy). This specific pillar of DayZ is one of many that will benefit massively from all the work that the engineering team has worked so hard on over the last few years. Ditching SQF alone is a massive step for any of you that have dabbled in modding the Arma titles, and the new animation system, as well as all the work the design team has done to new user actions takes the modding opportunities from what (to me) would feel like more of the same, modding Arma 2 or Arma 3 to a completely new level. I could go on for hours about all the possibilities I see there, and all the fantastic mod authors I hope to see get their hands on it, and bring their own vision to DayZ. Namalsk, DayZ 2017, Taviana, Panthera, DayZero, and so much more. Part of some of the most exciting times as a fan of the DayZ Mod was when we began to see people create mods of the mod itself, and I genuinely feel that what DayZ will offer to the talent of those individuals is so far beyond what was possible before. No, I don't have a set date for you for modding - but as it has been said in many status reports before - it will happen during our BETA phase of development. Obviously, for those that missed the announcement this will have to mean the release of the server tool package. I just hope I get enough notice to stock up on snack food for when the first mods start hitting DayZ, because you can bet your ass I'm going to be losing countless hours of sleep exploring these new takes on DayZ as a player and not a developer. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Dear survivors, since there is no concise information on what BETA is and what exactly will happen near its release, I would like to focus on recapping what our current plans regarding these things are. You might have seen our Gamescom video, but there is more to come and lot more things to work on. Because the 0.63 update is bringing all the new technology to you, the players, there will be a very tight feedback loop following its release to Experimental. There will be numerous changes coming in over the course of 0.63 Experimental, and some features might not be available on the first Experimental release, as we slowly ramp up to keep the performance and bug fixing focused. There will be tons of players trying to get in, and we will try and accommodate as many players as possible, because I do strongly believe it will be very hard to go back to 0.62 after this huge change happens. Now once that goes through all of the parts that need proper testing, and you are happy with the stability of the experience, we will start preparing for the Stable launch of 0.63 - the DayZ BETA. At that point in time, it is our intention to make DayZ server files available to anyone for free on Steam, meaning that you will be able to host your own servers. As far as platforms go, we aim to have these for both Linux and Windows. Following that, I know a lot of people will start digging into the data itself and have fun modifying it. It's going to be interesting to see what you guys come up with. However, you might be a bit limited during the initial release, as the current state of things suggests that the modding toolset might be behind schedule, and will be released shortly after BETA comes online. The toolset will be running the new Enfusion tools that you might have seen on different pictures from the office, and will again be available to all our players. But since lot of the data is compatible in some way, I think a lot of models will find their way into the game quickly, and people will start researching the new script as they test it out. Since almost everything you see in game will be written in script, you will have some amazing opportunities to change and bend the game in any way you want. Together with the DayZ server release, we want to provide our back-end technology that we internally call the Srvlet. This is basically our hive implementation in its entirety. With this strong tool, you will be able to set up your own hive, and do anything you might have ever imagined with your servers. Because this is actually quite complex, our intention is to provide decent documentation for the technologies recommended to run this platform. After the toolset gets out, we will look into opening the workshop on Steam, so that you guys can start sharing your creations freely. It's something we are especially excited about! There is more to it of course, like having a DayZ Launcher as a central piece to access all that, and I will try and space out this information and go into more detail as we get closer. With what features we exactly have in mind, what content you should expect and how these things will be handled. Hopefully this has helped you to understand how serious we are about this important milestone in DayZ development. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter Alongside crucial improvements which affect core parts of DayZ such as movement, ranged or melee combat we often mentioned, there is also other parts which are very important for delivering the best overall experience. You could already see the dynamic target selection in one of the previous Status Reports, and some of you could try it out in action with showcase of DEMO build at Gamescom. For me, together with whole HUD and new user actions, it’s an important part of the game which underlines all these great changes which separate old (0.62 and previous versions) and new DayZ (upcoming 0.63 AKA Beta). From our internal playtests and feedback from players at Gamescom, we decided to improve the HUD part of dynamic target selection and user actions a bit further. Now there is more options related to user actions, usually performed on some kind of target in world, shown directly in the floating widget of dynamic target selection, which makes it more readable for the player. These were previously located in bottom left corner, and they were quite easily overlooked when they became possible to perform (remember new user actions are contextual). In bottom left corner, there are nowonly actions which are applied directly to your character for now. https://i.imgur.com/3bnpOI6.jpg Another improvement to the bottom left corner of HUD that we've currently made is the addition of item in hands. Its name, actual condition and its quantity or stack is now shown in the bottom left too, above actions. This offers constantly consistent overview of information related to equipped item and items around the character without the need to over-use inventory screen to find out such basic info. https://i.imgur.com/4aeQUqU.jpg While shuffling parts of HUD around, we ended with dynamic cross hair, also. It changes form contextually when needed, to indicate some possibilities or states. Good example is a time progression of currently performed continuous action. Of course, HUD visuals are nowhere near final by any means. For those players who want to be immersed as much as possible in the world of DayZ, there is an option to turn off HUD completely on demand (of course independently from quick-bar). https://i.imgur.com/fQYlFWw.jpg To mention melee combat as well, its state is very rough and basically still in a state of prototype. We wanted to proof the concept out with new system of targeting and full body attack animations which are locking character movement, alongside with hit impacts which can take controls of character completely. Now when we've laid the basics and seen the potential it has, it is the way to go for us, unless something unexpected happens. As we definitely want to add some player skill to melee combat, we need to extend it with possibilities. Currently we are prototyping blocks, which reduce received damaged and influence hit impacts from attack, as well as evades, which helps to get out from line of attack. Next up is adding melee attacks with ranged weapons, like stabbing with bayonets, hitting with butt stock or pistol whips, as there is no worse feeling of helplessness when you are armed and someone successfully locks you into series of impacts and you need to throw gun down to be able to fight. Planned next are advanced moves such as knock-downs, finishing attacks on opponent on the ground or kicks/pushes. Anyway it’s really important for us to make solid foundation first because without it, melee combat won’t work as a whole, and it won’t matter how much depth and added layers will be there. As far as new camera implementation I mentioned in last Status Report goes, it’s from great part done. We just need to promote some functionality to the script, so we can set specific FOV in iron sights and optics. Also we will be able to start toying with naked eye zoom again. Apart from that we are dealing with 3PP camera position in space in different modes like raised, melee combat or sprint. With form following function... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek Some time has passed since I last wrote my Status Report. One of the reasons is that we're now working on longer term tasks and it's quite hard to write a Status Report without repeating myself. Another reason is that we're mostly working on things which aren't immediately visible. Today, I will summarise what we have done over the last two months. During August, major part of the team worked on delivering features that ended up being part of the DEMO version for Gamescom. It was quite stressful, because time was passing very fast and we had to stabilise the DEMO build and fix the most visible issues. Anyway, I believe that we were successful and we could return to our unfinished work with a good feeling of accomplishment. Now, we are mostly focused on improving character's movement and combat mechanics, because the entire development team is still not very satisfied with what we have presented at Gamescom. This is a very important part of the DayZ experience and we want to have the best possible implementation before we hit BETA. It's also important for fighting against the infected, because it's almost impossible to tweak and polish AI behaviour without having the player movement finalised - and so this is the reason why work on AI is also a bit on hold for now. One of the major things which were in progress before Gamescom is the game entity hierarchy (which is how the scene is represented for the game - so it is a system you won't be able to see). DayZ has been using an Arma legacy \"proxy object hierarchy\" - and this technology was limiting us to do some of the more exciting stuff from the DayZ feature list. We decided to switch this scene representation technology to the new one provided by our in-house Enfusion Engine. This will allow us to do things better and in a more optimised manner, allowing us to add more visual effects easily and for example create much better animations for weapons handling. Another thing we're now working on is the re-implementation of vehicles using the new systems. I have to admit that we're still working mostly on the physics part, and the character part is still not ready - but we hope that we will start working on character representation in vehicles soon (probably right after movement and combat mechanics). The entire system around vehicles has changed a lot. They are now composed of several configurable components, we're supporting generic number of axes (not only two like in 0.62 and before), handling is much more responsive and vehicles have a new suspension model, which will help players driver over smaller obstacles. Things which still are not finished are better tires friction model and simulation of some gearbox extreme limits. I wasn't sure if I should show you the following teaser (like I said, the character representation in vehicles isn't ready yet), but here it is. This is how we're testing vehicle physics for now - please welcome Fred Flintstone as a DayZ survivor, testing the new suspension system: https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgERKFnEloufTiw/giphy.gif (Please note: these are not final values for suspension and current values are serving for demonstration of new suspension model) Also, there are things which I would like to write about the topic of modding and what we are doing for supporting this feature, but it would be a lot of text for now, so I will write about it in next status reports (at least I'll have some ammunition for next time!). - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Martin Hello survivors! As I shared in the last Status Report, creating videos of a game in development is not always an easy task for us. It takes a lot of time from our regular schedules, and the closer we are to major releases of DayZ, the less time we have for recording gameplay. After experiencing the production of the 0.63 Dev Log, evaluating our options, and looking at the upcoming BETA/1.0 releases, we've made the decision that now is the right time to invest into our video production some more. Just yesterday, we've put up a job opening for what we at Bohemia call a Game Capture Artist. Ultimately, we're looking for a content creator that will work alongside me, Baty and Eugen, and spend most of his/her time capturing DayZ gameplay, as well as coming up with concepts of DayZ videos (and, eventually, trailers). It's a job that provides a perfect opportunity for making the hire directly from our community of players and content creators, and we'd be the happiest people on Earth to actually hire a DayZ fan, so please do apply if the job ad sounds like something you'd like to do for a living! I'll just add a personal warning: don't be misguided into thinking that this job is just playing 0.63 all day! It's also a lot of planning and documentation, and you really need to understand the technical aspects of video production as well. That said, we don't need years of professional experience, but a creative, organised and communicative person who's going to drive our video production to a very high standard. We also need you to work directly with us in Prague or Bratislava, but Bohemia Interactive will help you relocate should you feel a bit on the edge about that! Send them CVs in - and come live closer to the real Chernarus! - Martin Čulák / Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hey Survivors! These two weeks have passed really quickly! So, let's see what's happening in the community. I need to start with a letter sent to our forum. It is from our big supporter to the Dev Team. Her name is Baroness, she is an amazing content creator and her message made me cry. She met her husband in DayZ! What an amazing story! Thank you, Baroness, we love you! Hello. You don’t really know me. Well, maybe Baty does, a bit, in a way. I’m just a regular player. When the standalone came out, I was coerced by my brother into buying this game and play with him. I had never gamed on PC ever, had only ever slightly gamed on console when I was 12-13 (I am 34 now). Everything was very new to me. He told me it looked promising, explained what alpha was, and off we went on adventures as I spawned in Kamyshovo for the first time. Being on the creative side I have always enjoyed documenting my travels inside Chernarus. When I had gathered enough friends, we made clans, we built communities, alliances and harbored hate with other groups, as these things usually go. Some are still ongoing friendships that are on a deeper level, and this is amazing to me. About 2 years ago, some friends and I disbanded our group and decided to join a roleplaying community. It was fairly small at the time, and being the creative and helpful person I am, both of the leaders decided to include me on staff, where I developed some community management skills, learned to deal with all the kinds of hate that you guys are getting right now. I mean, I’ve been called Cersei more times than I can count on 2 hands. I’ve sowed many seeds of rapport, friendship, kindness and warmth, and I’ve been able to reap affinities, loyal friends, loving bonds, and even love. I met my husband in this last community, it was called ChernarusRP. My now husband (then-gamer-friend) and I joined forces and nurtured this incredible fellowship of like-minded survivalists with a penchant for roleplaying. All 700 of them. Us working together, entertaining complimentary notions of unity, respect and healthy dialogue,  got us thinking; we very quickly found out that, through working so closely together for a long period of time, we just ‘clicked’, and it just ‘worked’. Within the year, our relationship grew steadily towards a goal that we felt was right for the both of us; he moved from Texas to be with me in Québec (Canada). We have been together ever since. It was because of your game and everything that is has to offer, that I was able to meet the man of my dreams, the love of my life, my missing puzzle piece. My everything, really. Why am I writing this to you? Because I’ve noticed lately all the hate that you are getting. Spaggie and I had a long and interesting conversation about everything that you guys do behind the scenes that go completely unnoticed.  He told me that he sometimes writes little thank you notes and encouragement in the bug tracker, just for you guys to see that all that you do is greatly appreciated. In my opinion, more people should do this, every day. And had I not installed this game and kept at it, I would not be with this incredible man who I am with today. And I have you guys to thank for that. So thank you. For everything. BETA will be a blast I’m sure. I am following closely. We all are. And screw the haters. You got such a loving fan base and we’re all behind you and cheering you on. We might not tell you every day, but trust me, we all root for you and this wonderful game. Thank you for reading.

Eugen is following up doing his best to explain our basic goals for 0.63 Experimental and 0.63 Stable (BETA). We're also welcoming back our Lead Gameplay Programmer Mirek - after months of non-stop hardcore programming, we made him share some of the behind the scenes science happening under his watch. To close things off, as usual, we have Baty taking a look at your awesome community content, and in his short update, we have our Brand Manager Martin offering what could possibly be a dream job for many of you content creators out there! Let's get to it. Contents This Week Dev Update/Brian Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Brian Greetings Survivors! Apologies on missing the last Status Report - cards on the table, I knew the rest of the team had strong detailed info for you all and I didn't want to keep rehashing my sentiments on public development, or how big the move into BETA is for DayZ as a product. In the case of the last Status Report, I think the video said a lot more than anything I could type. Most of what you end up reading from me at this point in the project is related to postulation, concepts, and struggles and I'm honestly not certain that most of you are interested in that. We're at a stage where I feel like so many people out there are just holding their breath, waiting to get their hands on the first BETA builds and see for themselves how big the change is. Hell, I think I'm right there with you all on that. Back in the summer of 2013 when Dean, Matt, and I were stuck in a tiny room above a laundry room out in Mnisek, we were whiteboarding key elements we thought DayZ should improve on the gameplay of the mod (beyond the obvious). A good deal of what was prototyped over 2014, and 2015 came from those whiteboard meetings. I remember very clearly sitting down with Dean thinking on how we could improve the fresh spawned players chances to survive without basic weapons, as the desire was to make DayZ an experience similar to the novel \"The Road\" - which is where \"punching\" came in to play.

Another thing we're now working on is the re-implementation of vehicles using the new systems. I have to admit that we're still working mostly on the physics part, and the character part is still not ready - but we hope that we will start working on character representation in vehicles soon (probably right after movement and combat mechanics). The entire system around vehicles has changed a lot. They are now composed of several configurable components, we're supporting generic number of axes (not only two like in 0.62 and before), handling is much more responsive and vehicles have a new suspension model, which will help players driver over smaller obstacles. Things which still are not finished are better tires friction model and simulation of some gearbox extreme limits. I wasn't sure if I should show you the following teaser (like I said, the character representation in vehicles isn't ready yet), but here it is. This is how we're testing vehicle physics for now - please welcome Fred Flintstone as a DayZ survivor, testing the new suspension system: https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgERKFnEloufTiw/giphy.gif (Please note: these are not final values for suspension and current values are serving for demonstration of new suspension model) Also, there are things which I would like to write about the topic of modding and what we are doing for supporting this feature, but it would be a lot of text for now, so I will write about it in next status reports (at least I'll have some ammunition for next time!). - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Martin Hello survivors! As I shared in the last Status Report, creating videos of a game in development is not always an easy task for us. It takes a lot of time from our regular schedules, and the closer we are to major releases of DayZ, the less time we have for recording gameplay. After experiencing the production of the 0.63 Dev Log, evaluating our options, and looking at the upcoming BETA/1.0 releases, we've made the decision that now is the right time to invest into our video production some more. Just yesterday, we've put up a job opening for what we at Bohemia call a Game Capture Artist. Ultimately, we're looking for a content creator that will work alongside me, Baty and Eugen, and spend most of his/her time capturing DayZ gameplay, as well as coming up with concepts of DayZ videos (and, eventually, trailers). It's a job that provides a perfect opportunity for making the hire directly from our community of players and content creators, and we'd be the happiest people on Earth to actually hire a DayZ fan, so please do apply if the job ad sounds like something you'd like to do for a living! I'll just add a personal warning: don't be misguided into thinking that this job is just playing 0.63 all day! It's also a lot of planning and documentation, and you really need to understand the technical aspects of video production as well. That said, we don't need years of professional experience, but a creative, organised and communicative person who's going to drive our video production to a very high standard. We also need you to work directly with us in Prague or Bratislava, but Bohemia Interactive will help you relocate should you feel a bit on the edge about that! Send them CVs in - and come live closer to the real Chernarus! - Martin Čulák / Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hey Survivors! These two weeks have passed really quickly! So, let's see what's happening in the community. I need to start with a letter sent to our forum. It is from our big supporter to the Dev Team. Her name is Baroness, she is an amazing content creator and her message made me cry. She met her husband in DayZ! What an amazing story! Thank you, Baroness, we love you! Hello. You don’t really know me. Well, maybe Baty does, a bit, in a way. I’m just a regular player. When the standalone came out, I was coerced by my brother into buying this game and play with him. I had never gamed on PC ever, had only ever slightly gamed on console when I was 12-13 (I am 34 now). Everything was very new to me. He told me it looked promising, explained what alpha was, and off we went on adventures as I spawned in Kamyshovo for the first time. Being on the creative side I have always enjoyed documenting my travels inside Chernarus. When I had gathered enough friends, we made clans, we built communities, alliances and harbored hate with other groups, as these things usually go. Some are still ongoing friendships that are on a deeper level, and this is amazing to me. About 2 years ago, some friends and I disbanded our group and decided to join a roleplaying community. It was fairly small at the time, and being the creative and helpful person I am, both of the leaders decided to include me on staff, where I developed some community management skills, learned to deal with all the kinds of hate that you guys are getting right now. I mean, I’ve been called Cersei more times than I can count on 2 hands. I’ve sowed many seeds of rapport, friendship, kindness and warmth, and I’ve been able to reap affinities, loyal friends, loving bonds, and even love. I met my husband in this last community, it was called ChernarusRP. My now husband (then-gamer-friend) and I joined forces and nurtured this incredible fellowship of like-minded survivalists with a penchant for roleplaying. All 700 of them. Us working together, entertaining complimentary notions of unity, respect and healthy dialogue,  got us thinking; we very quickly found out that, through working so closely together for a long period of time, we just ‘clicked’, and it just ‘worked’. Within the year, our relationship grew steadily towards a goal that we felt was right for the both of us; he moved from Texas to be with me in Québec (Canada). We have been together ever since. It was because of your game and everything that is has to offer, that I was able to meet the man of my dreams, the love of my life, my missing puzzle piece. My everything, really. Why am I writing this to you? Because I’ve noticed lately all the hate that you are getting. Spaggie and I had a long and interesting conversation about everything that you guys do behind the scenes that go completely unnoticed.  He told me that he sometimes writes little thank you notes and encouragement in the bug tracker, just for you guys to see that all that you do is greatly appreciated. In my opinion, more people should do this, every day. And had I not installed this game and kept at it, I would not be with this incredible man who I am with today. And I have you guys to thank for that. So thank you. For everything. BETA will be a blast I’m sure. I am following closely. We all are. And screw the haters. You got such a loving fan base and we’re all behind you and cheering you on. We might not tell you every day, but trust me, we all root for you and this wonderful game. Thank you for reading.

Let's do some reading and watching folks, it's a juicy Status Report once again! Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen The last two weeks had us focused on different issues in the base and core features of DayZ. As previously mentioned, these are tackled through smaller scrum teams that are dedicated to these topics. Currently, we are running ranged combat team with focus on weapons and another one focused on melee combat. More are expected to be set up from vehicles to Central Economy or the infected. These should enable much faster iteration that can deliver on their goals as the technology requires less changes under the hood. This means that we are no longer tied to larger technology changes and can focus on the stuff that’s important to us and players alike: things that tackle immediate concerns that have troubled the game for a very long time. The approach we chose is based around priorities that carry through to other features, so we spend less time going back and redoing stuff over and over. Current priorities started with base movement of the character, which defines a lot of the work that is going to happen in both melee and ranged combat. Once we nail down the details, we can quickly implement and iterate things like player speed changing with rotation or rotation limits in order to cut on the erratic movement that is usually described as \"zig-zagging\". There are tons of things like these that community cares very deeply about. We take this feedback very seriously. Lot of these things have driven community interaction over these years. Bugs that we didn’t fix, features that didn’t have consistency or detail or were missing entirely. There is a reason behind everything. We spend a lot of time on figuring these out and once we are happy with our solutions we are going to get the discussion going. The process, however, requires you to test them in-game and that is where we go from prototype to full fledged feature. The thing is you try, and go for functionality first before the visuals get polished. It usually does not matter if it looks good if you’re developing the game. But it’s also the reason we don’t show many of these things that are in their early implementation. because they are just functional enough for us to iterate, but not polished enough to present ourselves with. That brings me to the next important thing. Imagine all these great things created with placeholders or skeletons of functionality that we look into and keep iterating on. Ideas are just ideas and they usually change for the better as development moves forward. What seems fun and good on paper though sometimes does not translate well in-game. If the technology used is layered enough to let designers test their ideas, we know we can differentiate the bad from the good. I don’t believe that we always come up with best solutions on the first iteration, and so that's why we listen to your feedback. Even when I look at our 0.63 Dev Log video below, I know (and see) tons of issues that just irritate me. But I’m not alone and this team is the best I had the chance to work with, and I have no doubt we can solve the issues. BETA can not come soon enough! That said, we would like to focus on covering these hot topics and how we solved them in the current iteration, because we bleed passion for what DayZ should be. Thanks for reading and enjoy the video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7FyfXZHFyY - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter After DEMO showcase at Gamescom, many of you expressed concerns about missing zoom with naked eye as well as toggling to aim down the sights. First off all, I want to underline that absence of naked eye zoom was intentional as we run into technical problems due interference with switching to iron sights, witch was key-binded to middle mouse button. Time was running out and instead of fixing the old camera behaviour, we decided to cut it completely, so that we can start implementing a new camera from scratch to allow us to have more control over it (which is being worked on right now). Anyway, now when that dynamic zoom is currently missing, we can start asking questions: is it really needed? How does it contribute to gameplay? What are the pros and cons? Eye zoom is kind of a long-term trademark of Bohemia Interactive games, the same way as the free look being independent on character movement. Simulation of mid to long range engagement wouldn’t be possible without such feature, as fluid, on demand changing of field of view from wide to correct perspective is needed there, typically for observing your surroundings and during gunfights. Without it, characters are just small group of pixels in distance, and probably no-one enjoys pixel hunting. On the other hand, we know that in the case we gave the player character some supernatural abilities, we would lower the importance of items which should be used in such situations, like binoculars or scopes (which can be used even while not mounted on a weapon). Currently, these have very limited use among players, as naked eye zoom (or focus if you want to call it like that) is enough for them to observe environment. Also, there is a bit of a problem with continuous switching of object LODs and textures, which puts additional pressure on the CPU/GPU. While this would still be the case with binos and scopes as well, these changes to FOV are instant and not continuous. Missing eye zoom will lead to bringing player engagements to much closer distances - and that’s the most important thing in DayZ - player interactions. Final decision hasn't been made yet - personally, I’m inclined to keeping this feature in the game, but even in the worse case scenario, aiming down sights will maintain correct perspective (with a bit of added zoom while holding breath to simulate focus), to avoid aforementioned pixel hunting during gunfights. I mentioned aiming down sights and we are aware that current keybind (middle mouse button click while raised) is far from ideal as it feels clunky - exactly opposite to real life, where aiming down sights is as simple as just moving your head and aligning the eye with sights. What is really important to me is the fact that there shouldn’t be any toggle into the aimed stance (raised nor iron sights/scopes). Which means character should go ideally to an idle pose when all controls are released. Toggle-able aggressive stance can unintentionally fiddle with character’s body language, which disrupts gameplay and the experience players have during their interactions. Currently, we are experimenting with different approaches of switching to iron sights while raised. Key-bind on keyboard can work, but I’m not a fan of it as it destroys the basic firearm controls between mouse and keyboard. On standard mouse, there is only two buttons which come as possible candidates to use - middle mouse button, and right mouse button. Scrolling up with the mouse wheel to aim down sights is much better than precisely clicking the wheel, also it’s meant for switching between iron sights and scope in case the given firearm allows it (think AKs and other guns from the eastern block, or additional sights mounted on RIS from the side of a weapon) and for cycling through scope zoom levels (for example hunting scope). Personally, I prefer a simple double click and holding right mouse button (basically double click without releasing the button after the second click of button) as a shortcut to switch directly from lowered arms to iron sights. To switch back from aiming down sights (ADS), just release the right button, click and hold it again (same for toggling from raise to ADS). These two methods are far better and we will most likely keep both. Last but not least, we've recently implemented turns to the movement itself (until now in 0.63, turns was only in idle) which is a game changer. It simply prevents zigzagging (which is used for dodging bullets) by limiting character rotation speed and adding rotation radius to turns while the player is moving. It’s scaled with character speed - the faster the movement, the bigger the radius is. There are still some issues that we are know need to be ironed out (in reality, nobody can see their back while doing 180 degree turns) and there is a bunch of missing features which will make it better and more visually pleasing (like tilting the character while making turns). https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCXI3he4kce1ZYI/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IsHO4Vt1B9yXCTK/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwnhO6D4Mww5BaE/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l378BlyRqZpY2yFcA/giphy.gif This solution differs from full-fledged inertia system, which can lead to players feeling like they are driving a tank with all that acceleration, deceleration and stopping after sharp turns. We want to thoroughly test it now, to feel how it plays and if it’s capable enough to achieve our goal of having smooth navigation through environment - as we definitely would like to maintain the hardly earned responsiveness and smoothness of the new character. Without zigzagging... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Martin Survivors! After a vicious editing battle that took waaaay longer than we all had planned, we were finally able to deliver the 0.63 Dev Log today. It's taking a quick (well, relatively quick, it's some 16 minutes of gameplay!) look at the key things that we presented at Gamescom last month. Let me just quickly give credits to Baty and our QA Engineer Dan Fialka for their tireless work on the actual gameplay capture - as I have said in the previous Status Report, it's not always an easy work tinkering with the internal build. I hope you'll all appreciate the early look at 0.63 at least in this format - it's certainly not the same as experiencing the new animation system and player controller first hand, but it's the best we can do now. Suffice to say, this Dev Log was a good learning experience and it made us rethink the way we produce video content for DayZ. Going forward, we want to streamline the creative process behind making development videos, and hopefully find a good, effective workflow for gameplay capture in 0.63. Last week, me and Baty also visited EGX in Birmingham, and boy: did we meet a lot of awesome people! Originally, our visit was really planned as a last-minute trip, as we just wanted to meet a couple of DayZ content creators at EGX - there was no booth involved like at Gamescom, and we only packed a bunch of DayZ lanyards just in case. Somehow, we ended up meeting with some 30 fellow survivors at once, occupying half of the EGX business lounge and demoing 0.63 to everybody (thanks to Matthew and the rest of the EGX organisers for not kicking us out!). Blue and Queenie, M1ndr, SepticFalcon and Dzoana all had their mods and friends there, we've also finally met the Twitter super-spammer Spaggie (and his friend @EssexRockerz!)... well I would like to name everybody we met, but it would make for a really long list. Thanks everyone for coming and chatting with us (and thanks Baty for talking me into the trip!), you all make the best, most dedicated community out there. We'll definitely be back to EGX next year, hopefully with a more official presence and a proper booth! Here's a couple of photos (credits to N-Reid!) and Tweets from the event: https://scontent-amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21765573_1338802539578724_868114829062265287_o.jpg?oh=e94693c4a47e849000cf9db24a4627dd&oe=5A823192 https://scontent-amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21950092_1338802699578708_8822583614646507263_o.jpg?oh=83bdc69320bb9f51a2ead9a8bb5fd36c&oe=5A4B770E - Martin Čulák/ Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hey Survivors! I hope you had amazing two weeks. As Martin mentioned, we were at EXG and it was epic, thanks everyone for coming. It was nice to meet you all! Let's start with the Real Chernarus by BrenUno, who‘s been there and took some amazing pictures for the community. Can you recognize all these places?  https://i.imgur.com/XK7RnaF.jpg https://i.imgur.com/9KcbvJo.jpg https://i.imgur.com/oQzbORb.jpg Streamer DeadlySlob did an amazing and very funny role-play video, where he acts as a drug addicted person. Other players were really surprised by his behaviour. We love it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Nxz66VcRk Let's check out some art. I chose three guys from community today, who are amazing artists and did nice job on their artworks. They have really similar style and we really like this.  The first one is Will. He did two artworks inspired by Chernarus. https://i.imgur.com/LAGbRGW.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jNG1QOE.jpg  And the second one is by Squad_Crow, who did his view of Novodmitrovsk and Lopatino Castle. http://i.imgur.com/IgPf4xQ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/WxUuLAd.jpg  AFX was on Rose City Comic Con in Portland as a survivor from DayZ. She had everything that the true survivor needs - duck tape, military boots and a long stick with an apple! I don't know if she killed any infected on her trip but she is definitely ready for it! https://i.imgur.com/EMzhQMV.jpg https://imgur.com/Jvk7Zjdhttps://i.imgur.com/Jvk7Zjd.jpg  French server Team Onu is preparing an event again. It is called Manhunt - Dark Walk and it will be tomorrow and you can see more info after you log in to their web pages. Here is a little teaser for it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGWgPf4MMxg&feature=youtu.be https://i.imgur.com/ZoxyhVR.jpg If you prepare any event for your community, just let me know on my Twitter and someone from our team can be there too. And I have a riddle for you today. Can you recognize this place? Tweet it to the official DayZ Twitter, I want to know how many players we have, who know the map very well! I know it is easy for hardcore players, but I will do a harder one next time. https://i.imgur.com/KFHUEyH.jpg  I am so happy to see all your content guys, no kidding. I try to watch all your videos, pictures and everything you post to our social networks or Reddit. Thank you for that and for your support, because we need it. We really appreciate to know that YOU CARE about DayZ. Because DayZ is love, DayZ is life for us. Header image by Sahindi.  - Baty / Community Manager  ",

There are still some issues that we are know need to be ironed out (in reality, nobody can see their back while doing 180 degree turns) and there is a bunch of missing features which will make it better and more visually pleasing (like tilting the character while making turns). https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCXI3he4kce1ZYI/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IsHO4Vt1B9yXCTK/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwnhO6D4Mww5BaE/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l378BlyRqZpY2yFcA/giphy.gif This solution differs from full-fledged inertia system, which can lead to players feeling like they are driving a tank with all that acceleration, deceleration and stopping after sharp turns. We want to thoroughly test it now, to feel how it plays and if it’s capable enough to achieve our goal of having smooth navigation through environment - as we definitely would like to maintain the hardly earned responsiveness and smoothness of the new character. Without zigzagging... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Martin Survivors! After a vicious editing battle that took waaaay longer than we all had planned, we were finally able to deliver the 0.63 Dev Log today. It's taking a quick (well, relatively quick, it's some 16 minutes of gameplay!) look at the key things that we presented at Gamescom last month. Let me just quickly give credits to Baty and our QA Engineer Dan Fialka for their tireless work on the actual gameplay capture - as I have said in the previous Status Report, it's not always an easy work tinkering with the internal build. I hope you'll all appreciate the early look at 0.63 at least in this format - it's certainly not the same as experiencing the new animation system and player controller first hand, but it's the best we can do now. Suffice to say, this Dev Log was a good learning experience and it made us rethink the way we produce video content for DayZ. Going forward, we want to streamline the creative process behind making development videos, and hopefully find a good, effective workflow for gameplay capture in 0.63. Last week, me and Baty also visited EGX in Birmingham, and boy: did we meet a lot of awesome people! Originally, our visit was really planned as a last-minute trip, as we just wanted to meet a couple of DayZ content creators at EGX - there was no booth involved like at Gamescom, and we only packed a bunch of DayZ lanyards just in case. Somehow, we ended up meeting with some 30 fellow survivors at once, occupying half of the EGX business lounge and demoing 0.63 to everybody (thanks to Matthew and the rest of the EGX organisers for not kicking us out!). Blue and Queenie, M1ndr, SepticFalcon and Dzoana all had their mods and friends there, we've also finally met the Twitter super-spammer Spaggie (and his friend @EssexRockerz!)... well I would like to name everybody we met, but it would make for a really long list. Thanks everyone for coming and chatting with us (and thanks Baty for talking me into the trip!), you all make the best, most dedicated community out there. We'll definitely be back to EGX next year, hopefully with a more official presence and a proper booth! Here's a couple of photos (credits to N-Reid!) and Tweets from the event: https://scontent-amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21765573_1338802539578724_868114829062265287_o.jpg?oh=e94693c4a47e849000cf9db24a4627dd&oe=5A823192 https://scontent-amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21950092_1338802699578708_8822583614646507263_o.jpg?oh=83bdc69320bb9f51a2ead9a8bb5fd36c&oe=5A4B770E - Martin Čulák/ Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hey Survivors! I hope you had amazing two weeks. As Martin mentioned, we were at EXG and it was epic, thanks everyone for coming. It was nice to meet you all! Let's start with the Real Chernarus by BrenUno, who‘s been there and took some amazing pictures for the community. Can you recognize all these places?  https://i.imgur.com/XK7RnaF.jpg https://i.imgur.com/9KcbvJo.jpg https://i.imgur.com/oQzbORb.jpg Streamer DeadlySlob did an amazing and very funny role-play video, where he acts as a drug addicted person. Other players were really surprised by his behaviour. We love it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Nxz66VcRk Let's check out some art. I chose three guys from community today, who are amazing artists and did nice job on their artworks. They have really similar style and we really like this.  The first one is Will. He did two artworks inspired by Chernarus. https://i.imgur.com/LAGbRGW.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jNG1QOE.jpg  And the second one is by Squad_Crow, who did his view of Novodmitrovsk and Lopatino Castle. http://i.imgur.com/IgPf4xQ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/WxUuLAd.jpg  AFX was on Rose City Comic Con in Portland as a survivor from DayZ. She had everything that the true survivor needs - duck tape, military boots and a long stick with an apple! I don't know if she killed any infected on her trip but she is definitely ready for it! https://i.imgur.com/EMzhQMV.jpg https://imgur.com/Jvk7Zjdhttps://i.imgur.com/Jvk7Zjd.jpg  French server Team Onu is preparing an event again. It is called Manhunt - Dark Walk and it will be tomorrow and you can see more info after you log in to their web pages. Here is a little teaser for it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGWgPf4MMxg&feature=youtu.be https://i.imgur.com/ZoxyhVR.jpg If you prepare any event for your community, just let me know on my Twitter and someone from our team can be there too. And I have a riddle for you today. Can you recognize this place? Tweet it to the official DayZ Twitter, I want to know how many players we have, who know the map very well! I know it is easy for hardcore players, but I will do a harder one next time. https://i.imgur.com/KFHUEyH.jpg  I am so happy to see all your content guys, no kidding. I try to watch all your videos, pictures and everything you post to our social networks or Reddit. Thank you for that and for your support, because we need it. We really appreciate to know that YOU CARE about DayZ. Because DayZ is love, DayZ is life for us. Header image by Sahindi.  - Baty / Community Manager  ",

As usual, Baty is closing of with awesome community content, and invites everyone to Birmingham's EGX next week! Let's get ready for some reading! Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Y'know, I've seen a lot of folks talking about 0.63 like it will solve world hunger - which is something I've seen associated with other pending builds before. Be it the new renderer, changes to sound, adjustments to economy, or even the introduction of the V3S. Typically people get pissy with me when I have to try and bring things down to earth, but I'm alright with being the bad guy in this case. Anytime you change the technology powering a piece of software, hell anytime you change the software itself in any way, you come up against risk. The degree of risk is the factor that fluctuates, and its up to the developers creating said software to weigh the risk of a change, versus the pay off. For us as a team, and for DayZ as a product the pay off is well worth the risk. For years now we've been internally prototyping, be it in documentation, in script, or in intermediate technologies built to serve the gap between what is functioning on the consumer Steam branch, and what is functioning internally on the main trunk. I've had the pleasure of previewing, discussing, and in some cases \"teasing\" these prototypes, and documentation for years. Eager to share our intent with you, but often blocked from actually sharing the experience with you due to technical limitations. The .63/Beta update is the first major step towards the technology finally being able to bring this vision forward. It is not the end of the road, but it is most certainly the most important lap we have made I did not overstate it when I said that the change to animation system, player controller, and scripting language would begin to alter how you interact with the world itself. This is fundamentally a huge change, both internally and externally for you, the consumer. I'm neither trying to charge up the hype train, nor am I trying to crush anyone's hopes and dreams. It's rare that a title gets the support from a company to spend the time working on improving the core technology to better meet the needs of design. Typically, technology limitations inform design within a few small exceptions from time to time. Its been a long road, and bumpy as hell ,but we're finally within sight of being able to finally share with all of you the things we've all worked on for so long. And we couldn't have done it without all of you. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hello survivors! Post-gamescom rush has ended quickly with a lot people getting sick, feverish from Gamescom plague. With people missing we were trying to get through the feedback in our internal post-mortem and follow up it up in the plan for following months and weeks before BETA becomes available. I have to say that the road does not end there, and we still are dedicated to polish the experience further before we leave Early Access. What BETA means is that most if not all features promised will be implemented in the new technology, and iterated upon further as we move to leave out of Early Access with 1.0 version. I believe that feedback will be critical in this phase where all the issues need to get ironed out. In the meantime, we focused on issues either seen during Gamescom or general plans that have been set out. Special attention has been put on critical issues of camera that was still up for refactor. As it is nowhere near the level that we want from the game, nor has the feature set needed. From the clipping issues to twitchy movement and abuse, there is lot of ground to cover. And there is a lot more as the whole Gamescom experience worked as an amazing focus test on large scale. We had the chance to see how people work around the new stuff available and observe to see the flaws in the whole system. Which was an amazing opportunity, and I can`t wait to have the same experience with other people online, so that we can make this game the best it can be together. The next step for us, is to finish up more advanced features for melee and ranged combat, additional camera technology to support all the new gameplay, and finalizing the character movement and variation, before we move heavily into area of infected, where some heavy work needs to be done. Once the base loop feels really good, we will move onto rest of the game to polish all these things in the new technology. We will survive!  https://confluence.bistudio.com/s/en_GB/7109/fbbcac5a2a6382e2f6a78d491af75161a7840bc8/_/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Viktor Hi everyone. It has been a while since the last time I contributed to the Status Report. The past weeks were a bit hectic with the animation things related to the Gamescom build. I think animators did a great job adding all the content which everyone was able to play for couple of days. We were very pleased by the positive feedback to the new player controller, injured animations, heavy items animations, combat and everything else that was presented. The version available to play was not final by any means. We are still aiming for significant improvements in many areas of player character and infected as well. The presented wounded character was a first draft in fact. In the upcoming days, weeks and months we will continue on animation improvements and reworks. Currently, we are also working on some new death animations. We are adding directional deaths for all item types and all stances. Initially, the character will play the pre-recorded animation only but later, we will start with directional death animation and in the middle of the animation, we will switch to ragdoll so that the characters would fall and align with environment nicely. Another big part of the game that is being worked on are poses for different items. There are hundreds of various food items, weapons or tools that need a proper pose. From the very beginning of the DayZ, we have decided to have a nice holding for each of these items. At the moment, all these poses are being made and added to the game. https://media.giphy.com/media/d2jjBgJMIPNKzE88/giphy.gif - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Martin Survivors, I just want to briefly update you on the status of the 0.63 Dev Log that we teased and promised to deliver after Gamescom. Unfortunately, a sizeable portion of the team (including Baty, Eugen and me) got hit by an outbreak of some sneaky virus that we most likely brought with us back from Gamescom. Since we have a very small marketing/community team here, this further delayed the production of the Dev Log video, but we're back in business now, and we've also managed to get some additional help from our QA Engineer Dan Fialka (who's been with us at Gamescom as well). He's recording some of the gameplay clips as we speak, so hopefully we'll be able to speed things up a notch now. Recording a couple of gameplay clips from an internal build may sound like an an easy task, but if they are supposed to be done according to a script, and connected with a developer voice over, it suddenly becomes a complicated undertaking - especially when the internal build of DayZ just decides to behave weirdly, and randomly throws crashes and glitches your way. Of course, we want to avoid showing these things in official content as much as possible, as the intent is to present the best of what the current build can offer. If anything, it also shows that the build is simply not ready to be played beyond a very controlled and structured environment that was the Gamescom booth, and that our decision to not release it on a Steam branch was very well reasoned. We'll let you know on our forums and social media channels the moment the video is ready - for now, please hold tight end enjoy some of the community content from Gamescom that we shared in the last Status Report! - Martin Čulák/ Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Survivors! The Gamescom epidemic hit a lot of us and I wasn't an exception. But I am ready for a new event! You might know there is a show called EGX in Birmingham, England. I and my colleague, brand manager Martin Čulák, will be there on Friday and we want to meet everyone from DayZ community, who is also planning to attend this gaming event. Watch our Twitter for more information. https://i.imgur.com/wnjEVTw.jpg Barely Infected came with an amazing idea. He organized a group of survivors and built a camp named \"DayZ Village\" where all the good people can live together and help each other in this cruel time of apocalypse. This project had great success and The Village is nowadays still pretty crowded. You can find it on Spaggie's server at 185.16.86.48:2402 and The Village is located on the Zub castle. I spent some time there and it was awesome. People are nice, they care about each other and try to protect The Village together. The Village was planned for just one week, but with this success, Barely Infected decided to prolong it. Barely Infected has documentation of every day on the server. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRS5rYnBy3M You can find a lot of content from creators on Youtube and make your own impression of what is going on on the server. For example from these guys: Gaming Junkie, CitizenZ, CamCANTRUN, Raig Prime, Kerbo, FriendlyNikolai, 2dogsgaming, RageBruh or HandZ. Here is a funny prank from M1NDER, he pranked the whole village. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzNDI9FCRRo And one last thing about this event - artwork of DayZ Village by Dominik Figlhuber. https://i.imgur.com/MXUa1cK.jpg Everyone is looking forward to the 0.63 update. But not as much as this guy. KaskadianRepublik's body is ready. But since 0.63 is still not ready for public, you will need to wait until it's done. https://i.redd.it/dxy5s57mq6lz.jpg I want to show you one video. It is about love between a dog and a human. Fluffy cute wolf who wants to eat everyone around him. But Whoopsie DayZ falls in love with him and wants to have him as a pet. How this can end?

We've been presenting the 0.63 playable DEMO in Cologne, Germany the entire past week, and met literally hundreds of players who tried the DEMO live at our booth as we watched them play. We've gathered a lot of important feedback, which both Eugen and Peter cover in their texts. There are also VoDs of Gamescom live streams, some exciting Gamescom gameplay from our community, and more! Let's get to it. Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen Gamescom DEMO has been an amazing experience for all of us. Being able to finally get direct feedback on 0.63 and talk to our old school players, or see the new ones playing it for the first time has made me more than a little happy. After getting this DayZ potential ready tech wise, we had a game to share, and talk about. It was exciting and exhausting. We are looking forward to sharing more. At the same time, I have some less exciting news for you. As the build we brought to Gamescom would still take weeks to get ready for public testing, we will not be releasing the DEMO for Steam. We really wanted to, but it just no longer makes sense to spend time polishing a very small part of the whole BETA experience. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive on the floor, and I do believe we are hitting the right notes on what BETA should feel like. Rather than releasing a DEMO, our goal is to get the BETA/0.63 update out as soon as possible in its entirety on Experimental branch when ready. That does not mean it's going to be rushed. We do believe that the only way out of this hellhole is a really good game that all of us want to play. We are going to focus on the combat a little while longer to incorporate some of the good feedback that we got, as well as features missing from the DEMO that were cut before it was used on the show floor. There is still a lot of details to implement, or content to convert in that regard. Since we have only returned from Gamescom floor on Sunday late night, we plan to have an internal post-mortem first and get the team together to plan out the next month in detail. However, as you may know, the scope of BETA is huge, and even though we have developed a lot of these features during the same time as technology, now it is time to put it all together. It’s a painful process, but the game is finally there. We are going to need a lot of balancing runs, polishing and bug fixing before we are happy to put it out. We will be reading the feedback on the details available and try and share with you more as we recover from the trip. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter Gamescom 2017 has ended, so let my write down my impressions. At first, knowing all that stuff which was completely missing from the DEMO, or just in early prototype state, and all the remaining limitations we still needs to figure out, I was feeling a bit insecure about the quality of the DEMO build that we brought for showcase at the Gamescom booth. I'm a person who likes to have things in order, and as polished as possible, which leads to situations where I’m just not pleased enough with the current state of the game. So naturally, I was very curious how it's all going to turn out in the end. To quickly recap what was presented in demo: New rocks, roads and their decals with parallax mapping. New characters with better body proportions and heads with lifespan, containing growing shaveable beards, washable bloody hands from skinning bodies New character controller and animation system with very responsive and fluent character movement, coupled with new physics for better collisions, allowing for smooth traversing through environment (yes even running down/up the hill!) New movement sets for turning, injured, falling character as well as carrying heavy items around in hands New gestures with the ability to move while using them New stamina system, differentiating character movement speed depending on their load New melee combat system with attack and hit impacts animations New ranged combat with extended weapon handling and aiming with new sway and recoil New intuitive way to perform actions with items in hands even while moving, crafting new ones even directly from world and interactions with environment without pixel hunting New HUD and inventory with clear layout and resized cargo and item sizes New voice communication including personal radio, megaphone and public address system New advanced placing which will be used for precise placement of specific items New electricity system with cable reels to reach far places And much more... There were thousands of gamers and content creators looking forward to get their hands on the first iteration of what DayZ will become in BETA. It was an interesting mixture of people that never played DayZ before, ones who put it down waiting patiently for BETA, and those who still play DayZ regularly and spent from hundreds to thousands of hours in-game. I've spent a great amount of time observing how people play the game, and discussed with them about what they like on the new DayZ, what would they still like to see improved, and why. With this approach, I gained a ton of feedback. It was very positive to see and hear that we are actually on the right track, and people do like what they see, and especially how it plays. Bear in mind nothing is set in stone yet, and everything could be changed, especially after valuable feedback we received. It will allow us to refine the design a bit more, so in it’s final form, DayZ could unleash its full potential, and allow people to enjoy what DayZ is so well known for - an emergent gameplay full of interactions, which creates stories filled with unique experience and leaving strong memories in atmospheric world. After meeting you at Gamescom 2017... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Martin As both Eugen and Peter mentioned, Gamescom was a really positive experience for us. The very stressful couple of weeks before we left the office and travelled to Cologne were definitely worth it in the end, as we've been met with a very warm welcome at Gamescom, and also fulfilled our mission: to gather preliminary feedback on an early 0.63 build. As Baty will share in her part of the Status Report, we did our best to provide some meaningful coverage for those of you not visiting Gamescom. The couple of live streams we organized with Twitch and GameStar.de were quite full of interesting news, so do check them out below, along with content from M1ndr, Barely Infected or Merlin from DayZ Underground. It';s a bit unfortunate that we were not able to capture a better gameplay clip for both live streams in time (due to both time constraints and last minute fixes to the playable DEMO build), so the presented footage was a bit bare bones and glitchy at times, but as promised, we will deliver a good amount of quality 1080p/60FPS footage in the following days. The footage will take the form of a Dev Log video similar to those made for 0.62, and you can expect around 10 minutes of new content with Eugen's developer narration. Also, since we decided not to make the DEMO available on Steam, we'll see if we can at least organise a live stream where you can see live gameplay, and ask us questions. Our pre-gamescom live stream was a bit of a technical failure, so we need to spend some more time planning the live stream, but we have a decent combat plan to make it all happen. That's it from me this week. Thanks everyone who visited us at Gamescom, you were awesome! Now, let's see some of the community content from our booth. - Martin Čulák/ Brand Manager  Community Spotlight http://i.imgur.com/QXzPXOP.jpg Gamescom is over, we are back in Prague, and work on BETA continues. It was something new to us and some people in the team have never been to a big event like Gamescom before. It was exhausting, but it was worth it, because your feedback is what we really needed. And we are really happy we got a lot of very positive feedback from you!  https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aDaNRsnZiw9WFaM/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKGzssVO4gOx28L8k/giphy.gif It was a total of 6 of us from the DayZ team, and for five days, you were able to meet us in the booth and play DayZ on 18 PCs.  You could play a short PvP demo, try some features from the upcoming 0.63 build and grab some nice little presents along the way. You've surely seen videos that appeared mostly on Twitter and Reddit from people who have already tried the demo. Unfortunately, as Martin explained, we do not have an official video ready yet, but we will catch up this week and if everything goes according to our plan, the video commented by our Lead Producer Eugen Harton will be released by the end of the week. Before it's out, you can look at the impressions of M1ndr and Rene (Barely Infected) who also visited us to try the DEMO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTxtPMdGQ48  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgquR7cg_c8 There were two live streams during Gamescom where our Lead Producer Eugen was talking about the Gamescom DEMO and BETA. First one on the line was the GameStar.de live stream, and the second one was a Twitch official Gamescom live stream (watch the VOD here, you need to move to time 8:10:55). https://www.twitch.tv/videos/168939184  We also hosted a community meetup at Gamescom, where we met ten of you and barely fit into our small meeting room. For almost two hours, we talked about DayZ and what you can expect from the BETA. And you got some special gifts we prepared for this event. I would like to thank you very much for coming to see us and I hope you enjoyed the meeting as much as we did! http://i.imgur.com/9K0S1Yd.jpg  Before Gamescom, we organized an event on Skalisty Island where players became knights and fought in teams to capture the Skalisty castle. Except for a bit of a waiting waiting, everything went well and all players were quite happy. There were some content creators who were streaming or recording their gameplay which they then placed on YouTube, so those of you who were not there can see it too. Blue team won the battle of the castle, but the greys fought bravely too. I want to thank everyone for their patience and the fact that they have arrived. You can look forward to another event soon! Just for clarification, the recording of the developer stream that accompanied the event was removed due to technical issues during the stream. Unfortunately, we did not correctly estimate the demands of the stream on the hardware and therefore the stream was flawed by unpleasant lags. We learned our lesson and it will be better next time. http://i.imgur.com/w5VGsIw.jpg I've created a list of YouTube recordings for you, so you can see what was happening through the eyes of several players. If I forgot to include someone just tweet me at @batyalquawen and I'm going to add you to the playlist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLFzBzEXIs35KV7j1K_ENizLoA2CtXMJrv&v=XGVBMSroIKY And in the end, I want to show you a funny bug we found yesterday. Adam Franců sent it to me with this description: While working on the tourist trails north of Svetloyarsk, we have discovered this massive structure that reesembles the shape of a lunch table. The exact origin and purpose of it is yet to be known. We have sent scout to investigate, reports suggest that this structure pose serious threat to the survivors and we have managed to take it down in a quick map editing action. http://i.imgur.com/NodQe3J.jpg http://i.imgur.com/77BeMay.jpg http://i.imgur.com/yzQrVwW.jpg Thanks again to everyone who came to play the Gamescom demo and to everyone who gave us any feedback. We really appreciate it. See you in two weeks guys and have a nice start of a new school year! Header image by MAMAD_NZR.  - Baty / Community Manager  ",

        "contents": "Stream-sniping&#x2014;the practice of playing a game against a streamer while watching their broadcast to gain an advantage&#x2014;is nothing new for those who play games on Twitch or other streaming services for large audiences. It&apos;s been getting a bit more attention recently due to some controversy in PlayerUnknown&apos;s Battlegrounds: <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pubg-studio-promises-changes-to-ban-system-after-stream-sniping-uproar/\"> a player was recently banned by Bluehole </a> for stream-sniping in PUBG, despite the developer stating they didn&apos;t have real proof of the offense, just suspicion. It&apos;s a conundrum: proving someone is stream-sniping is difficult&#x2014;perhaps impossible&#x2014;and banning players from a game without proof they have violated the rules is, in my opinion at least, a highly questionable and unfair policy. Some games, like Hearthstone, don&apos;t have set rules about stream-sniping, so it&apos;s debatable whether stream-sniping can even be considered cheating in the first place (though I&apos;d definitely call it poor sportsmanship, like stealing signs in baseball). Meanwhile, streamers who are vocal about stream-sniping are often criticized for complaining or being paranoid. &quot;Just stream with a delay!&quot; is a common suggestion, but as we&apos;ll see below, that&apos;s not really a viable solution for streamers whose livelihoods depend on engaging in real-time with their audiences&#x2014;and often doesn&apos;t even prevent stream-sniping anyway. I reached out to a few developers, streamers, and stream-snipers to get their thoughts on how big an issue it is, the various motivations snipers have and the methods they use, how it can be detected or avoided, and how (if at all) snipers should be punished by developers. I heard back from Brian Hicks, creative director of DayZ (and avid streamer himself), Hearthstone pro Andrey &quot;Reynad&quot; Yanuk (who also plays PUBG, which has recently seen the rise of a new form of griefing&#x2014;&apos;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pubgs-new-car-horns-have-turned-stream-snipers-into-stream-honkers/\"> stream-honking </a>&apos;), and Hearthstone streamer Octavian &quot;Kripparrian&quot; Morosan (Kripp) who recently discovered a sniper &apos;guild&apos; had formed against him.&#xA0; Kripp mailed me a link to his video, and his quotes in this article are taken from that.&#xA0;Other quotes are taken from emails and Twitter DMs, including from a number of snipers, current and former&#x2014;many who now stream games themselves. In some cases the quotes have been lightly edited or rearranged for clarity. DayZ How big of an issue is stream-sniping? Another sniper claims he stream-sniped one streamer so often the streamer gave up playing games on Twitch entirely. &quot;<a href=\"https://www.dayz.com/game\"> DayZ </a> hands down has suffered from stream sniping as an issue all the way back to the earliest builds of the mod,&quot; says Brian Hicks, who says he&apos;s been dealing with it as a developer since 2012. Since much of DayZ&apos;s success is due to streamers and content creators broadcasting the game live (rather than through traditional marketing) Hicks says he has &quot;run into obvious pressure to try and prevent it, and support said content creators in combating it.&quot; &quot;You can&apos;t really quantify how &apos;big&apos; of an issue it is,&quot; Hearthstone streamer Reynad told me via Twitter. &quot;That depends on the streamer and their goals in-game and as an entertainer. It is an incredibly frequent issue.&quot; For Reynad personally, he says in a video posted below, &quot;It does happen. And it happens like a hundred times more than you&apos;d expect.&quot; &quot;For a whale streamer, someone at literally 10K concurrents or higher, in a hundred-person game at least 10 people will be watching on stream, ballpark,&quot; Reynad says in his video. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StDxDougisRaw\"> StDxDougisRaw </a>, pro H1Z1 player for team <a href=\"http://settodestroyx.com/\"> SetToDestroyX </a>, says, &quot;For me, streaming sniping doesn&apos;t happen on a regular so I&apos;d go on a limb here and say half the time.&quot; Popular streamers not only draw snipers, but can find themselves hounded by the same stream-snipers again and again. <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/kbubblez\"> Current streamer and former stream-sniper KBubblez </a> contacted me to say she used to target a particular well-known streamer &quot;everytime he played H1Z1&quot;. Another sniper claims he stream-sniped one streamer so often the streamer gave up playing games on Twitch entirely. &quot;You have to keep in mind a few things,&quot; says Kripp about Hearthstone snipers. &quot;I changed my username on Battle.net several times, even throughout , and I do often, not always, but almost every day I stream with a delay. Now the delay is fairly short, rarely do I have it over ten seconds, but if I have a five second delay one day and then the next day I have a twenty second delay, then you&apos;re just not going to be able to queue against me because you don&apos;t know when I&apos;m queuing.&quot; Even with those measures, Kripp has found the problem persists. &quot;I have been experiencing, in the last few months, even with my efforts, playing against the same players every night in some cases. I remember throughout almost a full month, like a quarter of my losses were to the same person. Right? The same guy queuing against me like every day or every second day. Just absolutely ridiculous.&quot; Hearthstone Why do snipers do it? That's the trade off you get for being a streamer. If I was to offer my hand to my opponent in poker they would opt to see it every time. \"Chip\", Hearthstone stream-sniper I mainly assumed stream-sniping happened for attention or laughs, or out of some personal dislike for particular streamers, but the snipers I talked to gave me a number of different reasons. One former sniper, now a streamer that I&apos;ll call &apos;Ray&apos; for the purposes of anonymity, said he started sniping simply because he was bored. &quot;I was an avid player of DayZ, and after about 3000-4000 hours of gameplay, I had been to every city, every corner of the map, found every item, and been in hundreds upon hundreds of shootouts.&quot; Ray was looking for a new way to entertain himself, so he &quot;...turned to stream sniping because streamers in general tend to be entertainers, and I knew that interactions with them would probably be funny or interesting.&quot; Typically, Ray says he didn&apos;t just hunt the streamers down to kill them, but to interact with them. &quot;I would put on different accents and screw with them by picking nonsensical arguments or introducing myself as an annoyingly persistent hat salesman, or whatever other routine I had settled on for the day.&quot; Not every sniper is out for laughs or fun. One Hearthstone sniper&#x2014;I&apos;ll refer to him here as Chip&#x2014;says that for him, stream-sniping is about one thing and one thing only: winning. Streamers, while making a living and entertaining their followers, are also voluntarily handing an opportunity to their opponents. &quot;Why is up to me to say, well, I better not take this free advantage being offered to me?&quot; asks Chip. &quot;That&apos;s the trade off you get for being a streamer. If I was to offer my hand to my opponent in poker they would opt to see it every time.&quot; &quot;You take the trade of making 100 thousand dollars a year to someone seeing your cards in your hand,&quot; Chips says, in this case directly referring to Reynad&apos;s video (above) about stream-sniping. &quot;Clearly the trade off is always going to be worth it to you. So why bitch about it in the first place?&quot; For many, though, stream-sniping is just another path to entertainment and fun. Says KBubblez: &quot;I think it&apos;s funny when people are always going after them&#x2014;it also shows how good actually are. But mostly for the reactions, it&apos;s very funny.&quot; In the next breath, however, she admits &quot;Sniping in general can also be annoying though, it&#xA0;gets on your nerves when people are always coming after you, it makes it not fun and it&apos;s definitely not fair.&quot; How stream-snipers operate I could tell the time of day on the server by the position of the sun. \"Ray\", former DayZ stream-sniper The lengths snipers will go to to locate their targets is pretty staggering and, in some cases, quite impressive. Ray says he had an elaborate system for tracking down DayZ streamers, even after they&apos;d begun taking preventative measures to hide the name of the server they were on, and even hide their Steam names. &quot;I could tell the time of day on the server by the position of the sun,&quot; says Ray. &quot;I had every common server bookmarked, I could rapidly spot fake Steam profiles, and could look at their bio pages on Twitch to see what part of the world they lived in and know which regions their servers would be on. I even had an Excel spreadsheet with a list of the top 40 streamers for the game and which servers they frequented. This attention to detail allowed me to find them in minutes every time, no matter how much effort they put into hiding it.&quot; &quot;Often they will try and create identifying scenarios to ensure they are on the proper server,&quot; says Brian Hicks about DayZ stream-snipers. &quot;Broadcast messages, fire off gunshots, or use VOIP to receive instant feedback on the stream that they are in fact on target.&quot; In other games, streamers don&apos;t just use detective work but patience, setting up an ambush and lying in wait. &quot;They play Arena all day until they get really good decks, and they wait until I get a deck that&apos;s weak to it, so if they get like a really good tempo Rogue, well, they&apos;ll wait until I play Priest that doesn&apos;t have much early game,&quot; Kripp says in his video. &quot;And then on top of that they&apos;ll know my hand, they&apos;ll know my deck, they&apos;ll know all my answers, and I&apos;m expected to actually do well against these people.&quot; In Kripp&apos;s case, the lengths players are willing to go in order to stream-snipe him are extreme, to the degree that a &apos;sniper guild&apos; had actually formed (which Kripp then, somewhat amusingly, infiltrated). The video above is fascinating and well-worth watching to understand how these Hearthstone snipers work and why Kripp playing with a delay didn&apos;t stop them. &quot;Of course sometimes you run into non-destructive forms of stream sniping (what used to affectionately be called stream stalking),&quot; Brian Hicks says on the topic of those who don&apos;t necessarily want to beat the streamers but just play alongside them, or interact with them. &quot;However unfortunately, that always ends up being the exception and not the rule. More often than not you encounter your average young kid, looking to ruin someone&apos;s fun or get their five seconds of fame. For the stream sniper this is a heart-pounding moment of excitement, watching on one monitor as they sneak closer and closer to the content creator&#x2014;enabling themselves to have a direct impact on the stream, and feel powerful. It is incredibly frustrating, and demoralizing as a streamer. Hands down.&quot; How can stream-sniping be combated? ...any streamer of any game will tell you the difference between playing on and off stream. Andrey \"Reynad\" Yanuk Detecting stream-snipers, not just as developers but as the streamers encountering them, can be nebulous. &quot;As streamers, we&apos;ve played games both on and off-stream for thousands of hours,&quot; Reynad says. &quot;After that much time playing, any streamer of any game will tell you the difference between playing on and off stream. Sometimes it&apos;s something obvious a player does that gives away that he is sniping, other times it is a pattern of behavior across games from an individual. More often than not, and regardless of the game, a streamer will notice that something just feels &apos;off.&apos; Something that is not in line with the game experience off-stream.&quot; For instance, in Hearthstone, when the opposing player holds back a card that would be heavily punished by a card in the streamer&apos;s hand. That&apos;s not proof on its own, but if things like this happen far more often while streaming than while playing offline, it&apos;s natural to afford it a little suspicion. In other games, there are far more obvious signs. &quot;Watch a streamer queue up a game of <a href=\"http://agar.io/\">agar.io</a> and see how the server changes to nothing but Twitch emote characters hunting him,&quot; Reynad says. Developers, too, have attempted to find ways to detect streamers beyond just letting players report them. &quot;With DayZ Taviana (a mod I did with a small team prior to me joining Bohemia) our backend programmer slapped together several tools to allow us to monitor movement and behavior on a live server, but when you scale this up to something the size of DayZ or Battlegrounds the overhead becomes much more difficult,&quot; Brian Hicks says. DayZ &quot;Things like heatmaps help, but in the end&#x2014;on a larger scale it&apos;s really down to user reporting. When dealing with user reports, you also run into the obvious methods of abuse and larger content creators having the audience (fully outside their control) that can tip the scale and make things clearly unfair. &quot;To the best of my knowledge,&quot; says Hicks,&quot; the only gains we have made in combating stream sniping have been in aiding content creators in removing identifying information on screen. Things such as UI elements, server messages, and player names.&quot; Should stream-snipers be banned? &quot;While we understand we cannot prove that this player was watching the target stream&apos;s broadcast, we see no other reason why they would consistently attempt to be in the same lobby as someone who is broadcasting live other than to have an advantage in the game.&quot; That&apos;s a portion of Bluehole&apos;s statement on why they banned a player from PUBG after detecting them trying to join the lobby of a streamer. I can personally think of a non-nefarious reason someone might want to locate a streamer&apos;s server: to simply play with them. I used to watch several DayZ streamers religiously and often considered trying to join the server they were on. Not to snipe them while watching their stream, but just because I enjoyed their broadcasts and I thought it would be fun to run into them in the game. I never did this, and I like to think that if I had, I would have turned off the stream once I&apos;d joined the server they were on. And, if I <em>had </em>run across my favorite streamers in-game, would I have tried to kill them? Well, <em>yeah</em>. Part of the fun of playing with streamers, as KBubblez said, is finding out how good they really are. Someone who makes an effort to deliberately join a server that a streamer is on might not necessarily be watching the stream when they clash, and shouldn&apos;t, in my opinion, get banned for it. True proof of stream-sniping may be impossible to obtain, but bans simply shouldn&apos;t happen without it. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds That kind of harassment isn't okay in person, and it isn't okay online. \"Ray\" Many of the people I talked to also said snipers shouldn&apos;t be banned (and even many streamers agree). &quot;I don&apos;t think stream snipers should have any punishment,&quot; says KBubblez. &quot;It&apos;s a game. If you&apos;re gonna broadcast yourself online and have a following, you have to understand that there are going to be trolls. Is it annoying&#x2014;yes. But it makes for good entertainment.&quot; Stream-sniper Chip doesn&apos;t feel that his sniping in Hearthstone is cheating in the first place, because Hearthstone doesn&apos;t have a specific rule against it. &quot;Some games do have rules on third party programs, for example, League of Legends has a rule about no scripting. Using that program to directly affect how you play each game and giving yourself a huge advantage,&quot; he says. &quot;That rule seems completely reasonable. Maybe something is to be said about how much of an advantage you get from these things, I don&apos;t know. It seems to me like unless it&apos;s directly the way you yourself play, like scripts in League or aimbots in CS:GO, it should be completely fine to use.&quot; Ray feels differently, provided developers can find proof of sniping. &quot;If the developers have the tools to detect stream sniping and can enforce it, then it&apos;s healthy for the game to prevent that kind of cheating. Especially in competitive games where people are playing for rank, and also especially in repeat cases where one person is stalking and ruining games for a specific streamer. That kind of harassment isn&apos;t okay in person, and it isn&apos;t okay online. The people who defend this behavior truly puzzle me; it&apos;s not very different from going into someone&apos;s workplace and stalking them for hours on end.&quot; H1Z1: King of the Kill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StDxStaX\"> Mike &quot;StaX&quot; Baxter </a>, chief creative officer of SetToDestroyX, says &quot;Permanent bans from chat would be an alright punishment, but nothing can really combat it. As long as you press &apos;Start Streaming&apos; people will find a way into your channel.&quot; Meanwhile, Doug (also of SetToDestroyX) thinks progressive bans are the way to go, with more harsh bans if the sniper doesn&apos;t get the message. &quot;In front of the other viewers who are watching and see the sniping happening with no consequence will just cause more of a problem. An example needs to be made.&quot; Brian Hicks notes that punishment of stream-snipers just isn&apos;t viable without developers having proof and not just suspicion. &quot;Personally, I&apos;ve always wanted to be able to find a position where we can punish folks abusing the advantage of live streamed content (what I like to equate to the type of people who would screen peek during coop games in the 16-bit and later eras) however I have yet to find a position we can do this from, while retaining the moral high ground.&quot; Reynad, frustrated as he might be about the issue, says: &quot;I don&apos;t advocate banning players in these scenarios, because even as streamers we cannot be 100% sure it is happening.&quot; It&apos;s clear stream-sniping is a problem, and one without any real solution. Developers can make changes to a game and invent tools to try to detect it, and streamers can hide server details, change their usernames, and even play with delays, but none of these measures seem particularly effective against the dedicated and resourceful stream-snipers (past and present) we&apos;ve heard from. Banning players proven to be snipers might eventually dissuade some from the practice, but banning without concrete proof isn&apos;t fair, and that proof is nearly impossible to come by. For now, at least, stream-sniping will continue to be an issue, and streamers will have to keep looking over their shoulders for the people they know are watching. ",

Where the last couple of Status Reports felt a bit dry and lacking on exciting content, we're doing our best to improve our track record this week! Starting off with Brian, and his excitement which clearly shows that we've had a good couple of rough, but good weeks, through Eugen, who's offering a closer look at the contents of the upcoming Gamescom DEMO, and then over to Peter, who details the changes made to melee and firearms behaviour in 0.63, it's a joyride of teasing new and exciting content. Adam continues by sharing his bits on new decals updates, our Brand Manager Martin assures everyone that the Gamescom news will make its way to everybody, and Baty invites you to Gamescom AND to our upcoming community event next week that goes together with a pre-gamescom developer live stream. Oh hey, and there's also GIFs showing some new stuff (because yes - it is a long read again). Ready? Go! Contents This Week Dev Update/Brian Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Brian Greetings Survivors, As we approach Gamescom I can't help but reflect back on all the work, stress, and dedication that has preceded where we are now. Back in the end of 2013 when we were trying to prepare a build for Steam, we couldn't have imagined the opportunities all the time that has been spent on technology, and the foundation of the project would afford us. Looking at the Early Access release of one of my personal favourite pure survival titles, The Long Dark I can't help but remember what that experience was like when it first hit Steam, compared to how amazing it is now. The team has been working tirelessly for quite some time, and the focus over the last month or so on preparing a functional vertical slice build for Gamescom, which should raise spirits a great deal internally. One of the most frustrating professional experiences for me has been working on adapting the design and experience of DayZ over the years, but knowing that you the consumers couldn't see these changes and get hands on with them until the underlying tech was ready to support it. Gamescom is just over the horizon, and I know everyone here on the team is really focused on trying to get an outstanding snapshot of the new DayZ experience for you all. Not losing focus on the fact that the development teams'; core goals have been aimed specifically at setting the foundation of DayZ for the years to come is a difficult order. The technology that we hit Steam with fundamentally just can't do justice to the experience we want to bring, and fortunately leadership inside the company has understood that and supported our drive forward. BETA by no means is the end all be all milestone for DayZ - we have plenty of amazing things beyond it and before leaving Early Access - but this is fundamentally the biggest impact on how you the users interact with the world, and establishes the technology baseline that enables us to do all the things we've talked with you about over the years. It's been a hell of a journey, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hey guys! I'm going to get into detail in regards to what the Gamescom DEMO is and what is the plan going forward with it. As the Gamescom is getting closer, things are being set in stone. When we decided to go forward with the idea (which was about three months ago), we were nowhere near the expected result. However, deadlines and these goals make sure you are able to focus on what is actually important and as such help you eliminate the noise that gets in the way of development. Sometimes it's feature creep, other times you just follow an overly complicated solution to a problem that’s much simpler to solve. The renewed target helped us follow through. Everything starts with how you control a game, it needs to feel just right. When the game is making it hard to do what you actually want to accomplish through arbitrary complexity or inconsistency, it quickly becomes tedious. As this DEMO features the new player controller, animation system, physics and much more, it will feel different at first glance. Interacting with players, AI or environment should feel much smoother. We will have the new controls printed out for players coming in for an easy reference point. As this is quite a complex rework of the game, and we want people to test specific things, it will have its own \"map\" built around Staroye. The map includes new roads, rocks, and more reworked old assets as we are gradually improving visual fidelity, and leaving the old stuff behind. Only subset of player usable items will be spawning for the purpose of quick access, as we expect the turnover to be quite large. The density is also much higher to make sure you can try more things in a short span of time. Besides the map, you can also expect new particle effects implemented with Enfusion technology, new character faces and much more. It will feature the new inventory implementation, which again should feel much smoother and faster as we have invested quite a lot of time to do this properly. And one large change that we expect to have significant impact on how people play: you won't be able to move with inventory open. A lot of the things that people have used inventory to solve, like finding small items or interacting with their weapon to avoid delayed quick bar, will be long gone. Items will show their icons in the world, as well as all action being moved to contextual methods. And quick bar will become a core part of your setup as you explore the world of DayZ. You will get more slots as you get higher tier items, which in translation will increase the amount of stuff you can get done quickly in the world. There are tons of new animations coming in to show different states of character, exhaustion for example. And many detailed systems trying to avoid using text and use of heavy UI, so that living your life in Chernarus is all about your character. New gestures that will spice up the interaction between player, hopefully causing a laugh or two. Or making sure you can understand each other over a long distance. Lot of new UI changes that will focus on giving you enough detail if you want, or just immerse into the character in front of you. Tons of new sounds both ambient, character or weapon related. There is new synchronisation model that is quite different from what we had before, hoping to support the full scale of 100 players and tons of AI. All these things will be stress tested heavily to make sure there are no issues when we go live. Lot of the things are however heavily work in progress, but also for the first time, all of the new tech is in and working with new data. It's exciting as hell. And last but not least, new melee combat and ranged combat. But I'll let Peter talk about those  There will be issues I'm sure, as something always slips past, or gets broken in the last second. This is a complex game in making, and we can't wait to share our progress with you. We are discussing the possibility of making the DEMO available for a limited time on a separate Steam branch, but we'll yet have to see about that. Programmers - Weapons actions - Vehicle controller refactor - Melee combat (programming wise) - Particles (programming wise) - Physics and optimisation tweaks - New zombie controller - CLE (Central Loot Economy) tweaks - Bug fixing Animators - Animals animations - IK (Inverse Kinematics) poses - Injured animations - Weapons animations (loading/unloading) - Bug fixing Designers - Melee combat (script wise) - Communication - Horticulture - Particles (script wise) - Inventory UI refactor - Advance placing system - Gamescom demo preparation (spawning, menu, ...) - Bug fixing Audio - Sounds for weapons interactions - Footsteps sounds (surface vs footwear) - Ambient sounds - Bug fixing QA - Internal client stabilisation - Gamescom demo features testing - Bug reporting Art - Old assets rework - New assets preparation (NW Airfield ) - Object layout for western region - Bug fixing - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter As you may know from previous Status Reports, we scratched old firearms and melee implementations and started from the ground up to allow us fulfil our vision of having more control over firearms and melee fights, resulting in much better, authentic user experience. Both ranged and close combat have crucial role in DayZ, may it be in PvE or PvP encounters. Over the last few weeks, there was quite a lot of progress made in both combats, and now as things starts to look well enough, it's a good time to talk about them and showcase them. Ranged combat with firearms is defined by their handling and aiming models. So far on handling side, we have loading of firearms with either magazine or chambering directly with ammo from inventory, quick slots and even from the ground. Next is the mechanism manipulation itself, were you can feed ammo from a magazine to chamber in case of manual firearms, or eject ammo in automatic ones. It's also used to un-jam the mechanism once it gets jammed by a casing not being ejected properly. We reintroduced zeroing and fire modes, as well as iron sights, though optics are not working now due to some issues we're battling down the line (specifically switching to camera point on optic attachment, to be honest we have ran into some problems with attachments in general lately, as they are not in hierarchical order, so it will require some rewrite). Aiming model of firearms is where the real fun begins. Currently, we have a new sway mechanic (yay, finally!) - it mimics breathing with constant vertical movement as well as corrections of hands direction with subtle random horizontal movement. It's very effective and robust design solution which allows us to modify output by plenty of factors, like firearm attachments configuration, especially hand-guard and butt-stock, and its weight, character stance and movement, amount of stamina, overall character state with all that unpleasant things like low body temperature or diseases, and of course also the hold breath feature (yes, I'm not kidding). https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J3VOMkIWfvXET3q/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6vY4yDu8dW9tRknm/giphy.gif Recoil is another functional part of the aiming model now. While projectile is fired, we've introduced movement to firearms in all three dimensions. We are experimenting with pre-animated recoils, which are procedurally modified to produce nice looking visuals with ability to differentiate between firearms. Similarly to sway, it can be modified, this time it could depend on calibre, barrel length, overall firearm weight and its attachments, especially muzzle devices like brakes or compensators, and we are also considering impact from stamina. What's still missing is some sights misalignment in the aiming model, same goes to lifting firearms next to obstacles, however we will get there as both are a must have for proper aiming model. https://media.giphy.com/media/l41JRZS51tPApR94Y/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhn8Yt5RK08e5KHC/giphy.gif Quick update regarding new melee combat - in current state, it's already way ahead when compared to the old system. Apart from full body attack animations, which can now be chained into combos and opponents reacts to hits with proper strength and directions of impacts, there is also a dashed attack from sprint implemented now. I would like to highlight the current melee targeting implementation which is taking length of a melee weapon into account, as well as distance direction and vertical angle to opponent. Combined with rotating and dragging character towards selected targets during attack animations, it produces great looking, fluid and addictive melee combat. It's quite hard to miss your opponent now, gone are the days of grotesque melee fights where everybody ran in circles trying to play game of chance to deal some hit. https://media.giphy.com/media/l41JXGxC6efLed8eA/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhn4cAV0K6FXi6Tm/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/wKe1eEhzp12Du/giphy.gif Last but not least, we also introduced some changes to controls of the new character. What really stands out is changing of stances which is using one key now instead of three previously. With programmers and animators, we are discussing missing moves of new character, like leaning, jumping or climbing, as we would like to push on these and make them more interesting for gameplay. Apart from Gamescom 2017... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Adam Much like in the last Status Report, let's begin with a showcase of some additional improvements to the visual fidelity of Chernarus. This time, let's talk about decals. On Chernarus, decals are primarily used to make specific areas (such as concrete surfaces and roads) look more damaged / abandoned. We cant simply add local damage to the concrete / roads texture itself as it would look too repetitive in the end. And so these decals are a great way to add a local damage exactly where we want. While decal textures were trying really hard to show that there are holes in the road, they ultimately failed alone because they were missing visual depth in-game. Luckily, this was changed with the recent implementation of parallax mapping for decals. And since we have got new textures for roads for quite some time, we have also decided to re-do textures for all road damage decals so the visuals of decals match together with the new road textures (visual inconsistency between old decals and new roads is one of the reasons we decided to postpone the release of new road textures, originally planned for update 0.62). Here are some examples of how medium and small-sized decals look after these changes: http://i.imgur.com/8vYIgHW.jpg http://i.imgur.com/vVyHKMr.jpg http://i.imgur.com/zW9Thhh.jpg These changes (along with the new road textures that you can also notice on pictures) will be available with the update 0.63. And as usual - a short report on what has happened on western border of Chernarus since the last Status Report. Details were added around the Myshkino dam (including the HV power-line connection to Zelenogorsk), new recreational facility of TES company near the shore of Myshkino dam and probably the biggest lumber mill we currently have on Chernarus has been added north of Myshkino military site. These locations will hopefully make encounters in the Myshkino tents valley a bit more interesting and offer additional looting options for the players who prefer to roam the western region of Chernarus. http://i.imgur.com/ktGU7mS.jpg http://i.imgur.com/K5Av4yW.jpg http://i.imgur.com/gvrWRwl.jpg As always, please remember that all pictures show work-in-progress content. - Adam Franců / Senior Map Designer  Dev Update/Martin As we started outlining our Gamescom DEMO over the last two Status Reports, I've noticed a raising concern in the community about us presenting a build of the game on a gaming convention rather than delivering it directly to the core players on our Experimental and Stable Steam branches. As our community of existing players is what we truly care about the most, I'd like to address these concerns and add further context to Eugen's text above. First of all, thanks to Brian and his great relationships with guys over at Astro Gaming or Twitch, DayZ's been present at many public events in the past, and I'm sure it's always been fun for everyone to meet and greet while occasionally streaming or presenting some of the upcoming features. Usually, most of the news from these events also made it out to the general public - either by being directly shared by the DayZ team over social media, or organically by someone from the community posting on the forums or Reddit. This worked quite well, and considering that those activities were not a part of any sophisticated marketing/promotional plan (there hasn't been anything like that for DayZ, and this won't change until BETA drops on Stable), it's also been quite effective. Gamescom is a little bit of a step up from these events, as we'll be part of a bigger Bohemia Interactive booth. That means that our presence needs to be a bit more official, that we need to present something meaningful, and ideally also playable. That's where the Gamescom DEMO comes in - as a publicly playable content, it also conveniently solves three problems for us: a) it helps the development team to deliver a package even before the first BETA build is done internally, or ready for public branches - hopefully helping everybody have a feeling of accomplishment (which Brian nicely described in his part) b) it allows us to do very early focus tests in a controlled environment where we're standing right next to the person playing c) it helps us make a point to the general public that we are being serious about our intentions to bring DayZ to a stable 1.0 release, and support it for years to come (which some people still refuse to believe in) As Eugen already pointed out, we may (or may not), at some point, and in one way or another, make this DEMO available to all of you who won't be able to try it at Gamescom. While it's not fully representative of DayZ as the hardcore survival game it should be (and technically only works in a \"LAN\" mode as well), we understand that everybody just wants to get their hands on the new player controller! More importantly though, we have plans for extensive online coverage of all the things we're about to show at Gamescom. Just to pick a few that will happen right during the Gamescom week: we&'ll be live on the Twitch Gamescom stage for about 15 minutes, talking about the DEMO and DayZ BETA in detail, including some gameplay. We'll have a couple of media appointments that will hopefully produce some cool articles, and we'll also be producing our own photos or possibly even some basic video content directly from the show floor. Now, creating (audio)visual content of any upcoming game changes is always a struggle. With the way our community-driven development works (the moment we have a \"legit\" build in our hands that we need your feedback on, we drop it to Experimental), it is sometimes literally impossible to even play the internal branch of DayZ for several minutes straight, and prepare content in advance. This has been the case with the supporting content we're making for Gamescom, and over the last two weeks, it produced some rather hilarious clips: https://media.giphy.com/media/FjKA7M6blSaS4/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J3Dc0eJ2FXlVptK/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/26n6G4vSK5a6UGoWA/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xT39DldHs3S2mUL8cM/giphy.gif While those GIFs may look like a lot of fun, the reality is that any bug like that always breaks the gameplay, not to mention the recorded clip or screenshot. Count in some nasty crashes, network issues or general server degradation we still need to resolve, and you have a good reason for our Status Reports rarely including any relevant visual content at all. It's also why we're still relatively far from dropping any BETA package to the public Steam branches - while our new player character (and other systems) already work well within the limited scope of the Gamescom DEMO, they are not ready for the full-scale DayZ experience just yet. Well, that'll do it for today - I hope this helped some of you to get an insight on what's happening around the DayZ office. Baty should have some more details about our upcoming Gamescom coverage! P.S. - please do let us know if you're coming to Cologne, and come hang out with us! - Martin Čulák/ Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hello guys, We have two weeks till Gamescom and in our office, as in many other gamedev offices around the world, we're preparing for the game show, and we are starting to panic a bit. There is still so much to be done! I spent the last two weeks working on videos, which should be done before Gamescom, but as Martin wrote above, the game is still not in an ideal shape. Therefore, we tried to make the best of the actual unstable version to be able to show you some of the new features which you will be able to experience at Gamescom. I will not try to hide that it is very challenging to capture scenes without any errors and bugs, be we are close to finish and the video should be ready for Gamescom. In any case, Gamescom is near and the mood in the Dev Team can be best described as: http://i.imgur.com/Q61iSus.gif But enough of silly things. Let’s take a look at what is waiting for us in the next couple of weeks. Next Thursday 17th August at 17:30 CEST (GMT+1) you can look forward to a stream from our Bohemia Interactive office. We would like to share more information about what you can expect in our booth at Gamescom, we will tell you more about a demo we are preparing and also about a community meet-up which will be organized at Gamescom. We will talk in more detail about BETA and answer some questions. And this time, we will have moderators and better sound, so it will surely be better than last time! But the stream will not be only about DayZ. We will talk more about other BI projects, like Mini DAYZ, Ylands and Arma 3. Do not miss this stream; you can learn a lot of new information there! Simultaneously with the stream, we will host a small event. It will be a battle of the castle again, where we will return to the Middle Ages and play as knights. The event will take place on 17th August at 17:00 CEST (GMT+1) and you can be part of it if you are interested. You can sing up HERE. And now back to the Gamescom. It will be held between 23rd and 26th August at Cologne in Germany. As I said in previous Status Report, we will be there, specifically in hall 10.1., booth A010. Beside DayZ team, we will also have Ylands and Arma teams there. You will be able to play the Gamescom DEMO about which the devs were already talking above. More information about the demo will be revealed at the stream next week. I want to point out that the DayZ and Arma parts will be separated from public area and will only be accessible for adults 18+. But don’t worry if you are not 18 yet. You can come visit us at the community meet-up in front of our booth, talk with the devs and get some gifts. Community meet-up will take place on 25th August at 13:00 CEST, so don’t hesitate to come, we will be happy to see you. And if you come in DayZ cosplay, you will make us even happier! http://i.imgur.com/9BPFcNo.png For those of you that cannot make it to this year’s Gamescom, let me assure you again: we are preparing reports, videos and photos. Don’t forget to follow our social media channels!  Finally, we will have a look at some of your creations. First, I would like to present you a member of Spanish community who is playing on role-play server DayZRP and is sharing his adventures on his YouTube channel. His last video is \"La masacre\" and as the title suggests, it is about a massacre in Lopatino’s church. There are English subtitles for those who do not understand Spanish. I really like the story and what I like even more is the amazing comic that accompanies the video. http://i.imgur.com/88FJKLn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/k3vpMiB.jpg Other parts of the comic can be found on his Twitter channel. And now for the mentioned video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HgqfBJ8bak Further on, I was pleasantly surprised by a community member paulmosin, who is sending his ideas of a real world survivor to our Twitter. We love him! http://i.imgur.com/ruKdJ4B.jpg http://i.imgur.com/0cR6RH0.jpg http://i.imgur.com/0Xm4EVv.jpg http://i.imgur.com/hwA5upN.jpg  On Reddit, I discovered a post by user SpectreRobin. It is a DayZ picture, painted on 3 canvases, which is inspired by a well-known screenshot. It was drawn by his friend, who is a very talented artist. It reminds me of paintings in our office (which I would very much like to take home) and we can be only jealous that he has such a nice decoration on his walls. http://i.imgur.com/foUUHQF.jpg Thank you very much for all your content that you share with us on our official social networks, we really appreciate it. We will have to move the next status report to 29th August, because it would be right in the Gamescom week and we will not be able to prepare it while at the convention. But as I wrote above, we will be definitely sharing the photos, experiences and impressions with you the whole week. So make sure to follow us and we are looking forward to seeing you on the stream, and at Gamescom! Header image by RageBruh.‏ - Baty / Community Manager  ",

Where the last couple of Status Reports felt a bit dry and lacking on exciting content, we're doing our best to improve our track record this week! Starting off with Brian, and his excitement which clearly shows that we've had a good couple of rough, but good weeks, through Eugen, who's offering a closer look at the contents of the upcoming Gamescom DEMO, and then over to Peter, who details the changes made to melee and firearms behaviour in 0.63, it's a joyride of teasing new and exciting content. Adam continues by sharing his bits on new decals updates, our Brand Manager Martin assures everyone that the Gamescom news will make its way to everybody, and Baty invites you to Gamescom AND to our upcoming community event next week that goes together with a pre-gamescom developer live stream. Oh hey, and there's also GIFs showing some new stuff (because yes - it is a long read again). Ready? Go! Contents This Week Dev Update/Brian Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Brian Greetings Survivors, As we approach Gamescom I can't help but reflect back on all the work, stress, and dedication that has preceded where we are now. Back in the end of 2013 when we were trying to prepare a build for Steam, we couldn't have imagined the opportunities all the time that has been spent on technology, and the foundation of the project would afford us. Looking at the Early Access release of one of my personal favourite pure survival titles, The Long Dark I can't help but remember what that experience was like when it first hit Steam, compared to how amazing it is now. The team has been working tirelessly for quite some time, and the focus over the last month or so on preparing a functional vertical slice build for Gamescom, which should raise spirits a great deal internally. One of the most frustrating professional experiences for me has been working on adapting the design and experience of DayZ over the years, but knowing that you the consumers couldn't see these changes and get hands on with them until the underlying tech was ready to support it. Gamescom is just over the horizon, and I know everyone here on the team is really focused on trying to get an outstanding snapshot of the new DayZ experience for you all. Not losing focus on the fact that the development teams'; core goals have been aimed specifically at setting the foundation of DayZ for the years to come is a difficult order. The technology that we hit Steam with fundamentally just can't do justice to the experience we want to bring, and fortunately leadership inside the company has understood that and supported our drive forward. BETA by no means is the end all be all milestone for DayZ - we have plenty of amazing things beyond it and before leaving Early Access - but this is fundamentally the biggest impact on how you the users interact with the world, and establishes the technology baseline that enables us to do all the things we've talked with you about over the years. It's been a hell of a journey, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hey guys! I'm going to get into detail in regards to what the Gamescom DEMO is and what is the plan going forward with it. As the Gamescom is getting closer, things are being set in stone. When we decided to go forward with the idea (which was about three months ago), we were nowhere near the expected result. However, deadlines and these goals make sure you are able to focus on what is actually important and as such help you eliminate the noise that gets in the way of development. Sometimes it's feature creep, other times you just follow an overly complicated solution to a problem that’s much simpler to solve. The renewed target helped us follow through. Everything starts with how you control a game, it needs to feel just right. When the game is making it hard to do what you actually want to accomplish through arbitrary complexity or inconsistency, it quickly becomes tedious. As this DEMO features the new player controller, animation system, physics and much more, it will feel different at first glance. Interacting with players, AI or environment should feel much smoother. We will have the new controls printed out for players coming in for an easy reference point. As this is quite a complex rework of the game, and we want people to test specific things, it will have its own \"map\" built around Staroye. The map includes new roads, rocks, and more reworked old assets as we are gradually improving visual fidelity, and leaving the old stuff behind. Only subset of player usable items will be spawning for the purpose of quick access, as we expect the turnover to be quite large. The density is also much higher to make sure you can try more things in a short span of time. Besides the map, you can also expect new particle effects implemented with Enfusion technology, new character faces and much more. It will feature the new inventory implementation, which again should feel much smoother and faster as we have invested quite a lot of time to do this properly. And one large change that we expect to have significant impact on how people play: you won't be able to move with inventory open. A lot of the things that people have used inventory to solve, like finding small items or interacting with their weapon to avoid delayed quick bar, will be long gone. Items will show their icons in the world, as well as all action being moved to contextual methods. And quick bar will become a core part of your setup as you explore the world of DayZ. You will get more slots as you get higher tier items, which in translation will increase the amount of stuff you can get done quickly in the world. There are tons of new animations coming in to show different states of character, exhaustion for example. And many detailed systems trying to avoid using text and use of heavy UI, so that living your life in Chernarus is all about your character. New gestures that will spice up the interaction between player, hopefully causing a laugh or two. Or making sure you can understand each other over a long distance. Lot of new UI changes that will focus on giving you enough detail if you want, or just immerse into the character in front of you. Tons of new sounds both ambient, character or weapon related. There is new synchronisation model that is quite different from what we had before, hoping to support the full scale of 100 players and tons of AI. All these things will be stress tested heavily to make sure there are no issues when we go live. Lot of the things are however heavily work in progress, but also for the first time, all of the new tech is in and working with new data. It's exciting as hell. And last but not least, new melee combat and ranged combat. But I'll let Peter talk about those  There will be issues I'm sure, as something always slips past, or gets broken in the last second. This is a complex game in making, and we can't wait to share our progress with you. We are discussing the possibility of making the DEMO available for a limited time on a separate Steam branch, but we'll yet have to see about that. Programmers - Weapons actions - Vehicle controller refactor - Melee combat (programming wise) - Particles (programming wise) - Physics and optimisation tweaks - New zombie controller - CLE (Central Loot Economy) tweaks - Bug fixing Animators - Animals animations - IK (Inverse Kinematics) poses - Injured animations - Weapons animations (loading/unloading) - Bug fixing Designers - Melee combat (script wise) - Communication - Horticulture - Particles (script wise) - Inventory UI refactor - Advance placing system - Gamescom demo preparation (spawning, menu, ...) - Bug fixing Audio - Sounds for weapons interactions - Footsteps sounds (surface vs footwear) - Ambient sounds - Bug fixing QA - Internal client stabilisation - Gamescom demo features testing - Bug reporting Art - Old assets rework - New assets preparation (NW Airfield ) - Object layout for western region - Bug fixing - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter As you may know from previous Status Reports, we scratched old firearms and melee implementations and started from the ground up to allow us fulfil our vision of having more control over firearms and melee fights, resulting in much better, authentic user experience. Both ranged and close combat have crucial role in DayZ, may it be in PvE or PvP encounters. Over the last few weeks, there was quite a lot of progress made in both combats, and now as things starts to look well enough, it's a good time to talk about them and showcase them. Ranged combat with firearms is defined by their handling and aiming models. So far on handling side, we have loading of firearms with either magazine or chambering directly with ammo from inventory, quick slots and even from the ground. Next is the mechanism manipulation itself, were you can feed ammo from a magazine to chamber in case of manual firearms, or eject ammo in automatic ones. It's also used to un-jam the mechanism once it gets jammed by a casing not being ejected properly. We reintroduced zeroing and fire modes, as well as iron sights, though optics are not working now due to some issues we're battling down the line (specifically switching to camera point on optic attachment, to be honest we have ran into some problems with attachments in general lately, as they are not in hierarchical order, so it will require some rewrite). Aiming model of firearms is where the real fun begins. Currently, we have a new sway mechanic (yay, finally!) - it mimics breathing with constant vertical movement as well as corrections of hands direction with subtle random horizontal movement. It's very effective and robust design solution which allows us to modify output by plenty of factors, like firearm attachments configuration, especially hand-guard and butt-stock, and its weight, character stance and movement, amount of stamina, overall character state with all that unpleasant things like low body temperature or diseases, and of course also the hold breath feature (yes, I'm not kidding). https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J3VOMkIWfvXET3q/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6vY4yDu8dW9tRknm/giphy.gif Recoil is another functional part of the aiming model now. While projectile is fired, we've introduced movement to firearms in all three dimensions. We are experimenting with pre-animated recoils, which are procedurally modified to produce nice looking visuals with ability to differentiate between firearms. Similarly to sway, it can be modified, this time it could depend on calibre, barrel length, overall firearm weight and its attachments, especially muzzle devices like brakes or compensators, and we are also considering impact from stamina. What's still missing is some sights misalignment in the aiming model, same goes to lifting firearms next to obstacles, however we will get there as both are a must have for proper aiming model. https://media.giphy.com/media/l41JRZS51tPApR94Y/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhn8Yt5RK08e5KHC/giphy.gif Quick update regarding new melee combat - in current state, it's already way ahead when compared to the old system. Apart from full body attack animations, which can now be chained into combos and opponents reacts to hits with proper strength and directions of impacts, there is also a dashed attack from sprint implemented now. I would like to highlight the current melee targeting implementation which is taking length of a melee weapon into account, as well as distance direction and vertical angle to opponent. Combined with rotating and dragging character towards selected targets during attack animations, it produces great looking, fluid and addictive melee combat. It's quite hard to miss your opponent now, gone are the days of grotesque melee fights where everybody ran in circles trying to play game of chance to deal some hit. https://media.giphy.com/media/l41JXGxC6efLed8eA/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhn4cAV0K6FXi6Tm/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/wKe1eEhzp12Du/giphy.gif Last but not least, we also introduced some changes to controls of the new character. What really stands out is changing of stances which is using one key now instead of three previously. With programmers and animators, we are discussing missing moves of new character, like leaning, jumping or climbing, as we would like to push on these and make them more interesting for gameplay. Apart from Gamescom 2017... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Adam Much like in the last Status Report, let's begin with a showcase of some additional improvements to the visual fidelity of Chernarus. This time, let's talk about decals. On Chernarus, decals are primarily used to make specific areas (such as concrete surfaces and roads) look more damaged / abandoned. We cant simply add local damage to the concrete / roads texture itself as it would look too repetitive in the end. And so these decals are a great way to add a local damage exactly where we want. While decal textures were trying really hard to show that there are holes in the road, they ultimately failed alone because they were missing visual depth in-game. Luckily, this was changed with the recent implementation of parallax mapping for decals. And since we have got new textures for roads for quite some time, we have also decided to re-do textures for all road damage decals so the visuals of decals match together with the new road textures (visual inconsistency between old decals and new roads is one of the reasons we decided to postpone the release of new road textures, originally planned for update 0.62). Here are some examples of how medium and small-sized decals look after these changes: http://i.imgur.com/8vYIgHW.jpg http://i.imgur.com/vVyHKMr.jpg http://i.imgur.com/zW9Thhh.jpg These changes (along with the new road textures that you can also notice on pictures) will be available with the update 0.63. And as usual - a short report on what has happened on western border of Chernarus since the last Status Report. Details were added around the Myshkino dam (including the HV power-line connection to Zelenogorsk), new recreational facility of TES company near the shore of Myshkino dam and probably the biggest lumber mill we currently have on Chernarus has been added north of Myshkino military site. These locations will hopefully make encounters in the Myshkino tents valley a bit more interesting and offer additional looting options for the players who prefer to roam the western region of Chernarus. http://i.imgur.com/ktGU7mS.jpg http://i.imgur.com/K5Av4yW.jpg http://i.imgur.com/gvrWRwl.jpg As always, please remember that all pictures show work-in-progress content. - Adam Franců / Senior Map Designer  Dev Update/Martin As we started outlining our Gamescom DEMO over the last two Status Reports, I've noticed a raising concern in the community about us presenting a build of the game on a gaming convention rather than delivering it directly to the core players on our Experimental and Stable Steam branches. As our community of existing players is what we truly care about the most, I'd like to address these concerns and add further context to Eugen's text above. First of all, thanks to Brian and his great relationships with guys over at Astro Gaming or Twitch, DayZ's been present at many public events in the past, and I'm sure it's always been fun for everyone to meet and greet while occasionally streaming or presenting some of the upcoming features. Usually, most of the news from these events also made it out to the general public - either by being directly shared by the DayZ team over social media, or organically by someone from the community posting on the forums or Reddit. This worked quite well, and considering that those activities were not a part of any sophisticated marketing/promotional plan (there hasn't been anything like that for DayZ, and this won't change until BETA drops on Stable), it's also been quite effective. Gamescom is a little bit of a step up from these events, as we'll be part of a bigger Bohemia Interactive booth. That means that our presence needs to be a bit more official, that we need to present something meaningful, and ideally also playable. That's where the Gamescom DEMO comes in - as a publicly playable content, it also conveniently solves three problems for us: a) it helps the development team to deliver a package even before the first BETA build is done internally, or ready for public branches - hopefully helping everybody have a feeling of accomplishment (which Brian nicely described in his part) b) it allows us to do very early focus tests in a controlled environment where we're standing right next to the person playing c) it helps us make a point to the general public that we are being serious about our intentions to bring DayZ to a stable 1.0 release, and support it for years to come (which some people still refuse to believe in) As Eugen already pointed out, we may (or may not), at some point, and in one way or another, make this DEMO available to all of you who won't be able to try it at Gamescom. While it's not fully representative of DayZ as the hardcore survival game it should be (and technically only works in a \"LAN\" mode as well), we understand that everybody just wants to get their hands on the new player controller! More importantly though, we have plans for extensive online coverage of all the things we're about to show at Gamescom. Just to pick a few that will happen right during the Gamescom week: we&'ll be live on the Twitch Gamescom stage for about 15 minutes, talking about the DEMO and DayZ BETA in detail, including some gameplay. We'll have a couple of media appointments that will hopefully produce some cool articles, and we'll also be producing our own photos or possibly even some basic video content directly from the show floor. Now, creating (audio)visual content of any upcoming game changes is always a struggle. With the way our community-driven development works (the moment we have a \"legit\" build in our hands that we need your feedback on, we drop it to Experimental), it is sometimes literally impossible to even play the internal branch of DayZ for several minutes straight, and prepare content in advance. This has been the case with the supporting content we're making for Gamescom, and over the last two weeks, it produced some rather hilarious clips: https://media.giphy.com/media/FjKA7M6blSaS4/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J3Dc0eJ2FXlVptK/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/26n6G4vSK5a6UGoWA/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xT39DldHs3S2mUL8cM/giphy.gif While those GIFs may look like a lot of fun, the reality is that any bug like that always breaks the gameplay, not to mention the recorded clip or screenshot. Count in some nasty crashes, network issues or general server degradation we still need to resolve, and you have a good reason for our Status Reports rarely including any relevant visual content at all. It's also why we're still relatively far from dropping any BETA package to the public Steam branches - while our new player character (and other systems) already work well within the limited scope of the Gamescom DEMO, they are not ready for the full-scale DayZ experience just yet. Well, that'll do it for today - I hope this helped some of you to get an insight on what's happening around the DayZ office. Baty should have some more details about our upcoming Gamescom coverage! P.S. - please do let us know if you're coming to Cologne, and come hang out with us! - Martin Čulák/ Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hello guys, We have two weeks till Gamescom and in our office, as in many other gamedev offices around the world, we're preparing for the game show, and we are starting to panic a bit.

Eugen actually shares more on why we've been quieter than usual the last few Status Reports, and sets some expectations regarding BETA release schedule. Adam is reporting on the ongoing tireless work of the environment team, showcasing some of their recent achievements, and Baty closes off with a little teaser of an upcoming live stream - along with sharing awesome community content, of course! Let's get to it folks. Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight Dev Update/Eugen In BETA we trust, deliver we must. A catchphrase that I've seen on one of our whiteboards a couple weeks ago perfectly summarizes how we as a team feel right now. We know things haven't been perfect and that the experience that we wanted to provide has not always been consistent with our vision. Technology debt that we have been fighting held us in fairly firm grip where we quickly realized that providing short term solutions over and over isn't going to cut it. We had to rethink and go back to the drawing board multiple times to start making a fun game. We knew the solutions needed but the time investment was huge with lot of risks ahead. Which is where a lot of the development kept getting slowed down by the complexity of the engine changes that were needed, as well as unexpected issues that kept changing the landscape before us. It was a risky move that we hope will keep the game alive going forward and bring back those that might have been turned away by the state of the game. As we truly believe that what you players want and we meant to deliver wasn’t doable with the technology we had. There are players out there who are patiently waiting, while playing the game in a state that it is in now, others who wait for the full release or some who come back every once in a while to see what changed. Some are more invested than others, they read our channels, think about consequences of what we talk about, and some just want to see it in action. As the BETA is becoming a fleshed out reboot of the game all of us wanted, we plan to have a limited playable build at Gamescom this year. We're doing everything we can to make it available at the Bohemia Interactive booth for the visitors to try it out. The sole focus of this build is gunplay and player movement on an edited version of Chernarus prepared especially for the purpose of this demo. That is why a lot of our efforts have been looking at the flow of player actions, controls and consistency of their outcome. The team will be there in person to discuss the details with those interested. Feedback is the most important thing and we can't wait to see people play it and smoothen the rough edges. Now that also means that the next couple of weeks are fully focused on the content of the Gamescom demo, so that there are no major hurdles when fans in Cologne get their hands on it. All departments are trying to iron out the details as much as they can, so that we can have fun with in Germany. For the first BETA update itself, there is no release date yet. We don't want to let you down unless we're absolutely sure it's coming. The Gamescom demo work itself still counts towards the overall development of course, but we're not ready to put that version of the game on any of the public Steam branches - simply because the feature set of our demo will be limited and does not represent the complete DayZ experience. To finish things off, let's take a look at a list of things the team is tackling now: Programmers Weapon actions Vehicle controller refactor Basic state machines and script classes tweaks Melee combat preparation (programming wise) Central Loot Economy tweaks Physics and optimization tweaks New animation system for zombies Bug fixing Animators MoCap session preparation Animal animations Weapon animations Designers Melee combat (script wise) Aiming model Weapons handling Inventory UI refactor (crafting, character) Advanced placing system New player and item spawn definition Audio Sounds for weapon interactions QA Playtesting the 0.62 update Internal client stabilization New animations/weapons functionality testing Art Gamescom map preparation Old assets rework Fire mode selector for weapons Object layout for western region - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer Dev Update/Adam As we mentioned in earlier status reports, our efforts on improving graphical fidelity does not end with the update 00.62. With such massive change for the environment that update 0.62 has brought, one of the most important things for us is to get the environment right color-wise. That means getting lighting config right and having all assets in our environment properly configured (material and texture wise). We have already released an update for grass color for 0.62 on June 21 and since then our environment designer Mark has been working tirelessly on another iteration, this time focused mainly on changing another important piece of this whole color puzzle - satellite texture. You know this texture very well, because it is the one that you see whenever you look into the distance (and also texture, that is commonly used on community-made maps, that helps you in travels through Chernarus). Since Chernarus was originally made for Arma 2 and DayZ version has been built on top of it, it also uses satellite texture from this version. The texture was unfortunately nowhere near to being consistent in the beginning (in terms of the way details were made or in used color pallete) and with the additional things added on top of it in DayZ (northern, western expansion, settlement rework,..), this problem was only deepened. With the update 0.62, we felt that it is the time we finally look at this problem and make sure satellite texture for the new Chernarus uses somewhat consistent color pallete and looks good both in old and new areas. This change was also particularly important for us with update 0.62 since satellite texture affects colors of grass and ground textures. Now, do not expect that suddenly, a texture that has 15360x15360 pixels will be great in every detail, but the work that has been done so far is a huge step forward and will be good starting point for any additions and improvements. BEFORE http://i.imgur.com/EPtjbLh.jpg AFTER http://i.imgur.com/iC9yPjG.jpg With satellite texture changes of such scale, another pass on colors of grass and bushes/trees was inevitable (to basically bring close and far LOD visuals in-line with colors on new satellite texture plus several issues with material configuration were also fixed). And since all that was purely a data change, we felt that it would be shame not to include it for update 0.62, too. And so all of the changes are now available on Experimental Branch for you to check out. And I do have also some bonus pictures for you this time - work has progressed on western border of Chernarus. Currently, detailed object layout is being worked on in areas west of Zelonogorsk. First two pictures show new settlement, called Zvir. Third shows Orlye ozero with mountain Velikyj Kotel rising behind. Now please keep in mind that content on these pictures is work-in-progress. If you want to read more about the planned changes on western border, check out the last status report. http://i.imgur.com/eDufCvD.jpg http://i.imgur.com/1e0TVUM.jpg http://i.imgur.com/PIrroHp.jpg - Adam Francu / Senior map designer Dev Update/Community Spotlight Two weeks have passed and it is time again to take a look at what is happening in the community. At first, I would like to talk about an important event which is ahead of us this summer and that is Gamescom. We've been preparing for it for several months and it is very important to us, because we will meet you – the community, and at the same time, we want to show you something new. If you are planning to be at Gamescom, we will be glad to see you. You will find our booth in hall 10.1, where we will be among other Bohemia Interactive games. Also, for the Friday 25th, we are preparing a small meet & greet with developers, including small gifts for you. Cosplayers are welcome! We will tell you more on a live stream before Gamescom, which we are also preparing at the moment and which you definitely should not miss. Recently, I was playing DayZ when I got a message from streamer Issy telling me she can’t wait to show me what she made. And she sent a picture of shoes she painted in DayZ style! Simply awesome! I had to share that with you. http://i.imgur.com/pZ6xrJw.jpg When browsing through DayZ videos, this DayZ-inspired rap caught my eye, made by DayZ Standalone - Jiveturkey600. He created it on a request from one of the fans, who wanted a song from zombie point of view. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=468GVzy3S-Q Today I would like to focus on an international fan group on Facebook - DayZ Standalone Community, which has over 13000 members. People show off their accomplishments there, look for others to play with or share their own creations. It was this group where I found Mark Duncan Copland’s post showing postcards he receives from his friend Michael. It is amazing to see how DayZ became an important part of your friendship! http://i.imgur.com/04WHspI.jpg http://i.imgur.com/JYw6ToL.jpg http://i.imgur.com/so6UNbL.jpg  Another thing that got my attention in this group was a bar in Birmingham, UK, run by Jessica Mitchel  who, as a true fan, decorated the bar windows with DayZ style stickers. http://i.imgur.com/FlktcMD.jpg http://i.imgur.com/rTs81c5.jpg  I would like to invite you to a RP event on the Aftermath server which will take place next Wednesday. What is it about? \"Scientists have been carrying out experiments on the residents of Svetlojarsk. Slowly the residents started to notice people becoming sick and ‘turning.’ Information was leaked to the residents that scientists were going to visit the city to see the final result. The remaining residents held a secret meeting, they bought weapons off the black market and planned to capture the scientists to demand a vaccine for their friends and family. Worried that there may not be enough to go around, the civilians not only intended to capture the scientists but also kill anyone else who knew about the virus!\" If the story got you interested, don’t not forget to sing up, because the server is whitelisted. You can find more information on their web pages. As a last thing, I wanted to show you a beautiful screenshot of the town of Novodmitrovsk in an unusual resolution made by Reddit user NeuroticEUROtic. It is definitely worth sharing! http://i.imgur.com/p7qv5x6.jpg That is all from me for today. Make sure not to miss the next Status Report, where we will give you more information about the upcoming stream and Gamescom.  Enjoy the summer!

        "contents": "Last week I asked our community to share their sleaziest stories of scamming or being scammed in online games. I expected we&apos;d get some fun tales that we could all laugh about, but instead the comments section filled with anecdotes of such absolute savagery that I lost hope for humanity. Not only are some of you unconscionable in your unwavering commitment to screwing over your fellow person (or friends), but a few of you also suffered dearly at the hands of strangers on the net. I&apos;ve sifted through hundreds of comments to bring back what I feel are the worst, sleaziest, most underhanded stories. Whether it&apos;s screwing over your best friends for a quick buck or falling for the same scam twice in a row, all of you should feel bad. Really bad. For better and for worse, here are your most underhanded stories of scamming. Cat fishing anonymous&#xA0; It&apos;s one thing to use a silver tongue to trick someone into handing over a few items, but it&apos;s another thing to get your girlfriend to pretend to be a cam girl in order to scam some poor, lonely soul for 10 million gold. That&apos;s exactly what commenter Mugen did while playing <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/212160/Vindictus/\"> Vindictus </a>. &quot;I once scammed a guy from Italy out of 10 million gold in Vindictus,&quot; he explains in the comments. &quot;I told him I was a cam girl and I&apos;d Skype him if he transferred the gold to my character.&quot; Apparently Sleepless in Italy needed a bit more proof before he was willing to part with his precious gold, so Mugen somehow convinced his girlfriend to play the part. &quot;I got my girlfriend to go on Skype with him and she posted fake cam girl pics and pretended it was her,&quot; he says. &quot;After we got the payment we let him know he shouldn&apos;t trust people online and then deleted and blocked him on Skype. I&apos;ve never felt so horrible.&quot; Mugen&apos;s comment doesn&apos;t offer more details, but I have a million questions. How does someone even convince their girlfriend to pull this off? I don&apos;t know what makes me more depressed: That someone would stoop so low for gold or that someone would actually fall for it. Need a lift?&#xA0; You should never take a ride from a stranger&#x2014;especially if it&apos;s in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/day-z/\"> DayZ </a> and there&apos;s zero reason why that person shouldn&apos;t break your legs and leave you for dead. It might not be a traditional scam, but FixTheBloodyGame (let&apos;s call him Fix) has a story so brutal that it&apos;s only made worse by the fact that they got nothing out of it. &quot;Back when DayZ was an Arma 2 mod, myself and two friends had become fully geared, had a helicopter, and basically hit the endgame without much else to do,&quot; they explain. &quot;What we ended up doing was offering lifts around the map using our helicopter and arranging this via side chat. Needless to say, we had some ulterior motives.&quot; I shot him in the leg with a DMR, snapping them instantly. FixTheBloodyGame They stumbled upon a freshly-spawned player trying to get across the map so he could team up with his friend. &quot;We met up in Electro, got him to drop all his gear and loaded him into the chopper and set off flying northeast. After 3 minutes of flying, he got very confused and asked where we were heading. &apos;Just a quick stop at our base,&apos; we said.&quot; As Fix explains, in the far northeastern corner of the map is an island so small that no zombies spawn on it and most players don&apos;t even know it exists. &quot;We dropped the guy off on the island and said he should follow us to get some gear from our &apos;buggy tents that go invisible.&apos; After watching this poor sap run around trying to find the invisible tents, Fix decided to get nasty. &quot;I shot him in the leg with a DMR, snapping them instantly,&quot; Fix writes. But it gets worse. &quot;We quickly bandaged him, healed him up (his legs were still broken) and got him to crawl across this island to our helicopter. As soon as he got close we flew away. After he started getting sad in side chat we flew back to him and fixed his legs&#x2014;only to snap them and repeat the whole process again.&quot; Fix explains it was only when the island was a tiny dot on the horizon that they fully realized what an ass they had been. &quot;This poor guy just wanted to meet up with his friend. He now only had a few choices: Swim to shore (which would take multiple hours), starve to death (again, multiple hours in real time), or quit the server and never return. There was no suicide button and he had no gear to kill himself with.&quot; &quot;We got a lone message in side chat after all this, a simple &apos;:(.&apos;&quot; Reading this story, the optimist in me hoped that maybe Fix and their friends would find their conscience and head back for their crippled passenger. Nope. &quot;Our pilot got very sad for him, the rest of us laughed our arses off.&quot; Sorry for your loss&#xA0; XyzzyFrobozz&apos;s story is legitimately infuriating and proves that EVE Online isn&apos;t the only MMO where you can&apos;t trust your closest friends. &quot;I started a guild in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/lord-of-the-rings-online/\"> Lord of the Rings Online </a> on the Nimrodel server called the &apos;Rangers of Arnor,&apos;&quot; they write. &quot;I worked hard at recruiting and raiding to the point where we were becoming a medium-sized guild of about 50 people. Word was spreading that we were active and friendly, and so we started getting quite a few applications.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;A good friend of mine unfortunately took his own life. I had to travel out of state to be with his family and help with the arrangements, so I handed over some of the control of the guild to a &apos;trusted&apos; friend in the game&#x2014;specifically the ability to recruit or ban people from the guild. I explained what was going on and that I wanted the guild to continue growing by admitting people while I was away.&quot; Apparently even a real-life tragedy won&apos;t stop some people from abusing power. Xyzzy returned to a terrible surprise. &quot;When I returned I found the guild had grown by five players... and that my &apos;friend&apos; had kicked me from the guild and taken it over as his own.&quot; &quot;I never played LOTRO again.&quot; I don&apos;t blame them. Insanity is doing the same thing twice&#x2026;&#xA0; We received a mountain of entries involving <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/runescape/\" target=\"_blank\">Runescape</a>. This MMO is a madhouse of skullduggery, but Jake Brandt&apos;s story stands out because he was so hilariously naive as to fall for the same scam twice in a row. As he explains, his pride and joy was his full set of adamantium armor, which was the second-most powerful in the game at the time. Around that time, Jagex had released special sets of armor that had ornate gold or silver trimming along the outer edges. It was highly fashionable and Jake wanted some. &quot;I had heard about gold trimmed armor but knew nothing else about it, so when a guy on the road offered to upgrade my armor I happily accepted his generous offer and handed over two pieces of my gear.&quot; There&apos;s just one problem: there was no way to convert normal armor into trimmed armor. Instead of learning this lesson, Jake decided to roll the dice a second time. &quot;After a brief mourning period for my lost adamantium equipment, I kept walking down the road and there were a couple of people at a crossroads. One of them walked up to me and offered to add gold trim my remaining armor. I don&apos;t remember how I could have possibly thought it was a good idea to try this again, but I did. I even made him swear he wouldn&apos;t keep my armor like the last guy.&quot; &quot;And that&apos;s the story of the time I ragequit Runescape, never to return.&quot; <em>On the next page, someone gets the shit kicked out of them in real life.</em> Mistaken identity&#xA0; Zed&apos;s willingness to think on his feet is astounding. While playing <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Diablo 2</a> one day, he found an open public game named &quot;Cody come&quot; and decided to play a trick: He was going to pretend to be Cody. &quot;I joined the match with a stupid idea in my head that I was going to pretend to be the guy&apos;s friend,&quot; Zed writes. &quot;After joining the game I went to my stash checked out some items and was just doing my thing and the other guy in that current game said &apos;Hello&apos; and I replied &quot;Hey man, one sec gonna get a drink&apos; and he said &apos;Cody?&apos; I waited a minute or so and said to him &apos;Yeah this is my paladin account.&apos; So at this point he was gonna either call my bluff or believe me.&quot; But before the other player could decide, another player joined the game. It wasn&apos;t Cody, but a random PvPer who immediately turned hostile and challenged the two to a fight. &quot;I quickly invited the other guy to my party which he accepted and we ran out of town only to be slaughtered. We lost a boat load of gold and this guy was getting very upset,&quot; Zed explains. Then Zed saw his opportunity to strike. &quot;Now I knew what item he had because I was a dork and could tell if someone had an ethereal weapon. It was obviously one of the high end game rune weapons because we were in hell mode,&quot; Zed says. &quot;I told my buddy that with my current build I could kill the amazon if he would just give me the item. I requested trade and to my surprise the trade window opened.&quot; &quot;&apos;You better give it back dude, I&apos;m not joking,&apos; the guy said. I got the item and left the game.&quot; Again, please don&apos;t give strangers your rarest items. Even if you think they&apos;re Cody. Don&apos;t lose your head&#xA0; Many of the stories we received took place while playing games, but BunnyBot 5000 had the unfortunate experience of being scammed through Steam&apos;s trading interface. &quot;Several months after Team Fortress 2 had gone free-to-play, my most sought after dream at the time was a Max&apos;s Head to accompany my rabbit-themed username, BunnyBot writes. &quot;I had acquired the illustrious hat by way of birthday money, and was open in my flaunting of it.&quot; &quot;Now here&apos;s where it gets weird - I had, by this time, made several friends through Steam.&quot; As BunnyBot explains, one friend, &quot;Andrew&quot; lived just down the block from him. &quot;Late one night, I began messaging with Andrew and he requested I trade the Max&apos;s Head to him as part of some sort of elaborate prank. In my tired, sleep-deprived mind, I figured that Andrew was the kind of guy to do this kind of stuff, and if he tried to skimp me, I could just walk down to his house and chew him out. In my moment of weakness, I traded him my most prized possession.&quot; There was just one problem: BunnyBot wasn&apos;t speaking to Andrew. As BunnyBot quickly realized the moment &quot;Andrew&quot; unfriended him and ran off with his Max&apos;s Head, &quot;another one of my Steam friends had a very similar screen name to Andrew&apos;s.&quot; When BunnyBot began messaging him thinking he was Andrew, &quot;the sleazy fuck&quot; played along with it and &quot;pretended to be friend.&quot; &quot;I traded this stranger my most prized possession and he immediately unfriended me and made off with his ill-gotten gains,&quot; BunnyBot laments. &quot;I learned my lesson that day: Scammers are not always just some kind of weird broken-English bot that tries to add you out of the blue. They could already be on your friends list, lying in wait for just the right opportunity.&quot; Keep your friends close&#xA0; Of all the stories we received, Jirka T&#xFD;r&apos;s is easily my favorite. A common theme in most of these stories was that the scammer always got away without consequence, but Jirka paid dearly for his scam. Back in 2006, Jirka and his four friends, barely teenagers, got into playing Runescape. As he explains, they knew very little about the game and spent a great deal of time on YouTube learning how to play. That&apos;s when they came across a video teaching how to lure people into the open-PvP Wilderness so you could kill them and take their stuff. They were very excited. &quot;We were all around 11-12 years old so we had boners harder than steel.&quot; I ended up with 5 really small open wounds, broken nose and few cuts on my face. Jirka T r Using computers at their school, the five friends decided to give the scam a try. &quot;We tried pretty hard for a good hour and almost everyone looked through us and reported us,&quot; Jirka says. &quot; After another four days of trying and no result, I was kinda pissed off it doesn&apos;t work&#x2014;probably because English isn&apos;t my native language and all I could say back then was yes, no, hello, and bye. It was kinda hard and we were just copying and pasting every word we saw in the video.&quot; Frustrated by his inability to trick other players, Jirka decided to turn on his friends. &quot;One day I started yelling that I finally got some guy and I&apos;m going to kill him,&quot; Jirka writes. He explains that he convinced his friends to drop everything to come to his aid but only bring their cash so they had more room to pick up his victim&apos;s items. Except there was no victim. Earlier, Jirka had used all of his cash to purchase a set of rune armor&#x2014;some of the best in the game. When the first of his friends arrived, he immediately attacked and quickly killed him. &quot;All I saw was his red, steaming face over the monitor,&quot; Jirka writes. &quot;I kept my cool and tried my best to have the most serious poker face. He yelled at me &apos;Why did you kill me you dipshit?&apos; And with all my skill I turned slowly on him, tilted my face a bit and said &apos;What are you talking about?&apos; I said that couldn&apos;t be me because I was somewhere else&#x2014;I was lying and all it would take to catch me was for him to come to my computer and look at what I&apos;m doing.&quot; Over the next few days, Jirka succeeded in pulling the same stunt on the rest of his friends, looting their dead bodies until he had over 100,000 gold. &quot;I bought every single expensive thing I could find and what did I do when I had all this expensive gear and cosmetic shit on my account? I showed it to my friends!&quot; This would prove to be Jirka&apos;s undoing. Immediately his friends deduced who had scammed them and taken all of their gold. &quot;They didn&apos;t react by calling me a swine or an asshole,&quot; Jirka says. &quot;It was literally punches, kicks, hitting me with a chair&#x2026;&quot; They beat the shit out of him. &quot;I ended up with 5 really small open wounds, broken nose and few cuts on my face,&quot; Jirka writes. He explains that this all happened at his school in the Czech Republic, and his teachers had to call his parents to come and get him. &quot;After my mom saw me she nearly cried and my father was angry as hell.&quot; At the time, however, no one knew that Jirka had broken his nose. &quot;My nose hurt like hell so I went to my mom and told her about it,&quot; He says. &quot;She just grabbed me by the nose and yanked it to the side. When it moved, it scared her to the death and I went to the hospital that night, we had no car at the time and even no driver license so we had to wake up all of our neighbours and ask them to drive us.&quot; But getting beat up wasn&apos;t even the worst punishment. &quot;My account was completely wiped out. Nobody from those friends talked to me that year, and I looked like an ogre because my nose was four times bigger than usual.&quot; I guess the lesson here is not to scam people who are within arm&apos;s reach of you. Or, you know, just don&apos;t scam people at all. <em>Comments were edited for grammar and clarity.</em> ",

This unfortunately means that our Status Report will be rather brief and dry this time, but as always, we managed to come up with some interesting bits and pieces on what's happening behind the scenes. The main topic this week is the much discussed introduction of server browser tabs. Adam and the environment team is looking at all the settlements across Chernarus, and meanwhile, our friends over at the Bohemia mobile team released Mini DAYZ on mobile devices. It was quite the success to say the least! Let's get to it now, shall we? Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! This Status Report, I had something short and sweet for you. I wanted to take the opportunity to address adaptation to changes, and changes coming forward in general. I know some of you were confused about the changes to the server browser we mentioned in previous Status Reports, and it raised a small concern for me when it comes to larger changes in the future. The changes to the server browser organization are absolutely vital for the final product of DayZ. I know it might seem confusing now but we, as developers need to look at the bigger picture. Presenting the new user with the intended, vanilla experience of DayZ is absolutely critical. If a new user hits the play button, they should be paired with the best candidate official server. If a user looks at the server browser, they absolutely should be presented with Official Bohemia Interactive servers. Servers that present the experience we have laid out, and that we know won't be resetting storage, and will all be on the same central infrastructure. I fully realize that now it might seem confusing to some, and now it might not seem to make sense based off of the current state of the build - but I promise you, it makes sense in the long run. I'm also aware of concerns with regards to some official servers going offline and people losing their camps, and I promise you - this is something that will be looked at, to ensure user progress and protection from unintended player progression loss. As far as other changes moving forward, the sheer nature of how you interact with the world and the gameplay systems involved in it will inherently change. Simply put, things just flat out operate differently. Not only do all of these extensive changes coming in 0.63 and beyond allow us to bring DayZ to be the experience we want it to be, it also allows us to get rid of nasty pesky issues related to the previous system limitations. Be it addressing the nasty \"apple spam\" or the frustrating deaths at short heights, or even duplication through abuse of animation system glitches. I'm not saying this will resolve every issue present, but it puts us in a position to be able to more easily, and more stabily resolve these issues. That's really all I had for you guys for this Status Report, but keep in mind - no one is looking forward to playing 0.63 on Steam more then us, the developers. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen DayZ has always been a bit of a hybrid MMO - a combination of character and world persistence where instances act like shards themselves, and the official set of servers focusing on the \"vanilla experience\" - with the future expectation of additional variety with customizable modded servers. By being that open, we closed some doors for us to go full on on that notion of a never-ending progression in an online world - one that games like Destiny or The Division utilize. On the other hand, we still want to keep the idea that allows one player to spend a life of multiple characters across these shards, and have the variety of these different experiences that are consistent with our vision. As Brian has explained today, and in previous Status Reports, I just want to say that the main idea behind the recent tab separation is to maintain two separate worlds for our players. The \"vanilla\" one where you can expect a consistent experience, and the community one, where (when the BETA hits) you'll see a large variety of different gameplay and tweaks, with as much information as we can provide on the types of changes you'll experience there. Our goal is not to hide these community experiences, but only to show and highlight the difference. I understand that majority of people play on private servers nowadays, as there is more of that curation as to what happens there, and the dangers of vanilla where anything can happen might not be suitable for everybody. But we do believe that giving a choice and information about these differences will be crucial going forward when server files are released. You'll get a large variety of gameplay and setups, and less of a curated community vanilla experience that we at Bohemia will focus on. We expect that community will supply different maps, PvP modes, roleplay, and more. DayZ mod is a good experience to look back on as it has spawned multiple mods and changes, while vanilla experience attracted less and less of the player focus over time - which is understandable. As you spend hundreds of hours there, and want to try new things in this never ending world. We want to see the same thing with less hassle around doing so. You want to play a mod, we want you to see what that mod is, make the flow of playing without any obstruction, and we want to highlight these different experiences for players seeking them. I also want to touch upon the subject of 0.62 development, as it's slowly closing up with a last couple of critical fixes getting merged in, such as crash fixes. When we move on, we want to be sure that your experience is as stable as it can be, within the limits of knowing that everything is going to change when BETA hits. All these small things will help us with this huge transition. As I have said multiple times, we believe that we have something great ahead of us that will realize the vision all of us had for what sometimes feels as forever. So yes, we are now focusing on combat first and foremost in our internal version - and we want to share that with you as soon as possible. There are multiple build reviews every week, as we march towards this long awaited goal. To give a glance at the currently open development items in our teams:  Programmers Vehicle controller refactor New animation system for infected Animation events for player Communication systems optimization Mosin 1930 basic state machine and script class MP 133 basic state machine and script class MP5 basic state machine and script class CLE (Central Loot Economy) tweaks Physics and optimization tweaks Bug fixing  Animators M4A1 animations Player turns for pistols Unarmed & one hit reactions Player graph fixes IK (Inverse Kinematics) poses  Designers New player and item spawn definition Player action targeting and floating cursor User actions in multiplayer Advanced placing system Inventory UI refactor (crafting, character) Aiming model Melee combat targeting Traps with grenades Weapons handling  Audio Bug fixing Sounds for animals  QA Playtesting the 0.62 update 0.62 feature testing Internal client stabilization CLE testing  Art Old assets rework Detailed object layout for western border (locations west of Lopatino) NWAF overhaul Location names revision  - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Adam With .62 update being on stable branch for over a month now, we have pretty much transitioned strictly to goals for the update 0.63 and onward. Primary focus being the overhaul of the North West Airfield, finalisation of tourist trails and additional locations on the western border of Chernarus (along with overall tweaks to the area). In this status report, I would like touch a bit on the topic of the plans on western border - where we are going with the changes and additions that we work on now. Our aim is to preserve its wilderness look. We wont be populating this part of the map with lots of settlements like we did on north. Instead of that, we are focusing on adding more lonely locations such as lodges, tourist destinations (tourist trails will be extended to western border) and industrial/farm locations. That being said, western border is quite a huge area by itself, and so it would be a shame to not to include anything that would resemble a settlement. There are currently three tiny settlements in the works, most of them composed of few houses scattered around without some structures like you are used to in the mainland of South Zagoria. Following pictures show one particular settlement located just south of the new castle that has been added in update 0.62 (and already received more details and polish now!). Please keep in mind that these pictures show work-in-progress content: http://i.imgur.com/xL1yVkA.jpg http://i.imgur.com/aeDr51U.jpg And just to give you an idea, how we imagine some lonely locations, here is a screenshot of lonely lodge somewhere on the western border: http://i.imgur.com/9IqaEjQ.jpg Now I would like to give you some names instead of using \"new castle\" or \"new settlement\", but the truth is that we have to yet figure out some proper names. This is particularly important for the finalization of tourist trails task, and so in addition to mentioned map tasks, we are also in the process of revisiting all location names that are currently used on Chernarus, along with figuring out names for new locations or locations that are worth naming and were not yet named. Goal of this revision is to also make sure names are somewhat consistent between each other and fit the overall theme of Chernarus. There are over 230 entries (names for settlements, terrain features,..) that we currently work with, but luckily, we've got help from Ivan Buchta - one of the key members of the team behind the Chernarus for Arma 2, to make sure we do not deviate from the original naming rules and that you all will be able to call parts of the map with proper local names :). - Adam Franců / Senior map designer  Dev Update/Martin While we're still very much on hold with pushing any release buttons for DayZ on PC and consoles (as the development is breezing towards BETA), I'm more than happy to share some of the excitment that's currently flowing through the veins of everyone at the Bohemia mobile team. On July 3rd, after some time of soft launch testing, they finally launched the iOS and Android versions of Mini DAYZ worldwide! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrRWNlha6MI Being 100% free to play (there's no catch, no in-app purchases or hidden transactions - it's just free, plain and simple!), Mini DAYZ stays true to the survival heritage of DayZ standalone (and the mod) by being incredibly unforgiving. It's something that I personally find very refreshing, especially on the mobile games market, which somehow always leans towards very casual and clichéd genres. The good thing is, I am probably not alone, as Mini DAYZ has been occupying top positions in appstore charts across the worold ever since it launched on July 3 - which is well, well deserved, even more so when you realize that Mini DAYZ was originally just a fan made project! Hats off to our mobile team, and especially to Mike Azovskikh, the original creator of Mini DAYZ for web browsers who spearheded the development of mobile versions here at Bohemia! I encourage you to download Mini DAYZ on AppStore or Google Play - for now, it's single player only, but still offers a very entertaining balance of healthy frustration and fun :). Well, that's it from me today - the next time I'm doing a Status Report, it will actually be related to that one DayZ that you all really care about. Gamescom is getting very close... but for now, let's see what Baty has for you this week! - Martin Čulák / Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors! First thing I would like to address today is the new server browser. It seemed to confuse you a bit, because a lot of you were struggling to find your favorite community servers. http://i.imgur.com/z0foNrq.gif When you launch DayZ and open the server browser, you will find yourselves on the Official servers tab. If you select the „favorited“ checkbox, only the official servers which you have added to your favourites will be displayed. If you change to Community tab and select „favorited“, you will see your favorite Community servers only. It's so simple! http://i.imgur.com/KJ1gCVi.jpg  And now, we will look at two of your videos. Wobo did a couple of tests and prepared 30 tips for update 0.62, which you may have not heard about previously. Make sure to check it out, you could be surprised. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpGMvG4nloM  Some of you will surely be familiar with the name TheLonelyBandit. Last year, he decided to create a challenge video, where he was getting food and water only from people he mugged. He returned to it now and his video where he attacked a really nice guy entertained me a lot. Watch him survive without the usual supply of food a water! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y4ogZoMSOw  A lot of interesting stories develop on the DayZUnderground servers thanks to organic role-play without rules. Stories of ordinary people trying to survive, as well as faction members who are not afraid to take your possessions and your life. Short articles \"Humans of Chernarus\" will allow you to look inside the mind of such people. http://i.imgur.com/JwWCMwA.jpg  And again, we have another peak into our office: http://i.imgur.com/tOhm0pI.jpg  That is all from me and as always, if you have any interesting content, which you would like to share with us, tweet it on our official Twitter profile.

There are over 230 entries (names for settlements, terrain features,..) that we currently work with, but luckily, we've got help from Ivan Buchta - one of the key members of the team behind the Chernarus for Arma 2, to make sure we do not deviate from the original naming rules and that you all will be able to call parts of the map with proper local names :). - Adam Franců / Senior map designer  Dev Update/Martin While we're still very much on hold with pushing any release buttons for DayZ on PC and consoles (as the development is breezing towards BETA), I'm more than happy to share some of the excitment that's currently flowing through the veins of everyone at the Bohemia mobile team. On July 3rd, after some time of soft launch testing, they finally launched the iOS and Android versions of Mini DAYZ worldwide! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrRWNlha6MI Being 100% free to play (there's no catch, no in-app purchases or hidden transactions - it's just free, plain and simple!), Mini DAYZ stays true to the survival heritage of DayZ standalone (and the mod) by being incredibly unforgiving. It's something that I personally find very refreshing, especially on the mobile games market, which somehow always leans towards very casual and clichéd genres. The good thing is, I am probably not alone, as Mini DAYZ has been occupying top positions in appstore charts across the worold ever since it launched on July 3 - which is well, well deserved, even more so when you realize that Mini DAYZ was originally just a fan made project! Hats off to our mobile team, and especially to Mike Azovskikh, the original creator of Mini DAYZ for web browsers who spearheded the development of mobile versions here at Bohemia! I encourage you to download Mini DAYZ on AppStore or Google Play - for now, it's single player only, but still offers a very entertaining balance of healthy frustration and fun :). Well, that's it from me today - the next time I'm doing a Status Report, it will actually be related to that one DayZ that you all really care about. Gamescom is getting very close... but for now, let's see what Baty has for you this week! - Martin Čulák / Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors! First thing I would like to address today is the new server browser. It seemed to confuse you a bit, because a lot of you were struggling to find your favorite community servers. http://i.imgur.com/z0foNrq.gif When you launch DayZ and open the server browser, you will find yourselves on the Official servers tab. If you select the „favorited“ checkbox, only the official servers which you have added to your favourites will be displayed. If you change to Community tab and select „favorited“, you will see your favorite Community servers only. It's so simple! http://i.imgur.com/KJ1gCVi.jpg  And now, we will look at two of your videos. Wobo did a couple of tests and prepared 30 tips for update 0.62, which you may have not heard about previously. Make sure to check it out, you could be surprised. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpGMvG4nloM  Some of you will surely be familiar with the name TheLonelyBandit. Last year, he decided to create a challenge video, where he was getting food and water only from people he mugged. He returned to it now and his video where he attacked a really nice guy entertained me a lot. Watch him survive without the usual supply of food a water! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y4ogZoMSOw  A lot of interesting stories develop on the DayZUnderground servers thanks to organic role-play without rules. Stories of ordinary people trying to survive, as well as faction members who are not afraid to take your possessions and your life. Short articles \"Humans of Chernarus\" will allow you to look inside the mind of such people. http://i.imgur.com/JwWCMwA.jpg  And again, we have another peak into our office: http://i.imgur.com/tOhm0pI.jpg  That is all from me and as always, if you have any interesting content, which you would like to share with us, tweet it on our official Twitter profile.

Let's get to it. Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Martin Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors. This week, I don't have too much for you, as a great deal of everything I've been so excited to work with Peter on over the last few years is entirely dependant upon the successful implementation of DayZ's new spine („DayZ 2.0“ as Peter lovingly referred to it in our 0.62 Developer Live Stream). This Status Report, I wanted to talk the opportunity during the wait for BETA to clarify a few points about our in game economy, and the continuing work that Peter, our programmer Frantisek, myself, and others are putting into it. Everyone on the dev team sees the same issues as everyone else. Buildings with repeated spawns of the same item in some situations, some items ending up clustering in one region of the map, helicopter crashes not spawning firearms (psuedo-intentional currently), and of course the availability of early game supplies. BETA isn't just about the new animation system, and related components. The programmers responsible for the central economy have reached the end of what they can do on 0.62, and a lot of work to address some of these issues has actually been done, but is on the 0.63 branch. Obviously this will need some testing and iteration to get it to where we want it - but I wanted everyone that follows developement of DayZ to be aware of the fact that we do know, and that we want it to improve as much as you all do. Heli crashes should spawn firearms, hell some of the stuff we have coming in the pipe has been discussed as clearly being dynamic event spawns only - so that people have to hunt these items down and can't just go to a static location to find them. There are many small details to DayZ that have a ripple impact on all connected points of gameplay, and the economy is a perfect example of this. Without it functioning properly, all the fancy improvements, fluid character movement, enhanced visuals and so on won't matter because the new player to DayZ won't be able to feel like they can learn, and master the world. They won't feel empowered early on to take on the challenges of surviving in Chernarus, if they can't understand how to find basic supplies. I could ramble on about this for hours, but I'll save you all that wall of text - Eugen, Peter, and Viktor will take it from here. I look forward to seeing you all in Chernarus, be it on 0.62 or beyond! - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hi everyone! Since this week, everybody is really swamped with actual development work, I'll try to fill in for the lack of cool visuals or exciting new feature documentation and reflect upon some of our past decisions on the technology side of things. With the mindset of developing technology first to enable our vision for DayZ platform, we have gone through number of changes internally. Things were cut, changed, deprecated and sometimes reintroduced to get a good and fun anti-game first and foremost. However, all the work that was necessary to achieve this vision has shown us how large our technological debt was at the time. All that lead to plans that were clashing heavily with how fast we were able to remove the debt, and we ended up prototyping a lot of our vision in old technology to see what works, and what does not. We have shown a number of roadmaps that have proved to be a failure on our part. Anticipating, or predicting the effect that the technology debt can have on development speed is a very hard endeavor - and we have learned the hard way. It has always been a good plan longterm for both the game and the company. But we all do believe that what DayZ is supposed to be has not been achieved yet, and we plan to deliver on that notion. For years, we have worked with the best intentions on a good technology base for all features that this sandbox would largely benefit from. Going forward, we want to start sharing some of the internal documents to show what that means to us, how it fits within BETA and full release. We anticipate a lot of features will make it to the first BETA release of DayZ on this new technology base, meaning that the things that we haven't been possible to fix, change, improve, or make at all will get the much needed spark and detail. It's perhaps not going to be one big swoop for every single part of the game, but it certainly feels like playing a new DayZ. We hope that this will show the possibilities of our new technology and inspire modders alike to be far more ambitious with their goals. If you look at the gameplay of DayZ, one of the main and core pillars of it is the player itself. We have created mindmaps on design side that help us with the longterm vision of how (and where) the player interacts with the enviroment, or with the game. The graph you see below shows the base of what new player should be able to do by 1.0, with most features being available during BETA. http://i.imgur.com/z0EMPYK.png DayZ Player Features Diagram (PDF, 1MB) And that’s only the overview of the player character interactions, not mentioning other features (say, base building) or the infected. DayZ is truly vast in scope, and there is a lot to go through, but starting here is important. I think you (the players) and we (the developers) want the same thing. There will be differences here and there, don't get me wrong. But we share the idea of having a multiplayer sandbox with apocalyptic background that’s unforgiving, immersive and gets your heart beating when these scenarios you have been imagining in your head become possible. We want this technology to allow just that. To serve as platform for a game where you get into these intense situations, or maybe just sit down at a fire with a friend. Where it feels almost real. We know what the game should be, we didn’t want to be held down by constraints of past, and have chosen to do our best and get the limits out of the way. I don't want to sound like a broken record, I just really want to play this thing with you guys and get lost in Chernarus again. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Viktor Hi everyone! I'll be very short this time as we're still working hard on player character and firearms animations. What I can tease today is a couple of GIFs with some upcoming new gestures that I was talking about in my recent Status Reports. These new animations include military gestures, as well as new taunts. Here is the preview of some of them: https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOrw2aa2x1JBXuqnC/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOrwnFsXPkB5k7PPO/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOrw6O5YlLwhGgIo0/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohryntr3CSFWYzfcQ/giphy.gif   https://media.giphy.com/media/l1K9EIY9MddPUaLQs/giphy.gif - Viktor Kostik/ Lead Designer  Dev Update/Martin Survivors, I have a brief update for you from our small marketing/community department within the DayZ Dev Team and Bohemia Interactive. As some of you may know, we set ourselves a goal to improve the DayZ website and make it (much like DayZ itself) more modern, functional, and fun to use in general. It's the single most important communication channel that we have to engage with our community, and it deserves our attention for sure. On the related forums thread, we've been collecting your feedback on our website, and the Bohemia Interactive online services team has succesfuly implemented some of your ideas (like having a proper search function, or tags to quickly sort through content). While there is still a lot of work to do on the actual content of the website, you can already check out a preview of the general design direction the DayZ.com website will be taking: our friends over at the Bohemia Interactive Mobile Team have announced the release of Mini DAYZ on mobile devices (3rd of July, save the date!) and their new website at www.minidayz.com shares some of the basic design elements that we will be using at DayZ.com as well. Other than that, we are getting ready to keep everyone well informed while our developers are doing all the hard work on the first BETA build. What lies ahead of us is probably one of the greatest challanges that we have faced in terms of communication - we need to do our best to keep your interest high with no other major updates scheduled for release before BETA, and at the same time, we need to make sure that the world knows that DayZ is still alive, and very much kicking when BETA happens. As Eugen mentioned, some of our past estimates were not quite right, and it's always the bad news that stays in everyone's minds. In general, do expect more of what we did for the 0.62 release (video content like the 0.62 Update Overview, and the 0.62 Developer Live Stream), and be ready to play a huge role in all that - our community is one of the three pillars that support everything we do at Bohemia after all. That's all from me, let's see what Baty has for you this week! I think she mentioned something about us having an Instagram account... :) - Martin Čulák/ Brand Manager  Community Spotlight Hello guys! I want to thank you for all the feedback on the newest Stable update. It took us long time but we are really happy we found a fix for the annoying memory crash. Let's take a look at the official forums. We have instructions how to fix an issue with Steam overlay when using MSI Afterburner. If you are using this software take a look HERE . Another thread I want to show you is really nice. Survivor BeanZMakeMeSurviveAlone is sharing his inspiring story with us on how DayZ helped him in real life. I must say I saw one of the best DayZ screenshots ever this week. DrDeSync is a very talented man and has a way with interesting situations. Check out his latest screenshot named \"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\": http://i.imgur.com/wX8AEpM.jpg What Community Spotlight would it be without some nice community video! Mr_Beardman made a story of escaping from a horde of infected on the Aftermath role-play server. Check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ch1wdXYh6k  Are you on Instagram, Survivors? I personally love it and so I created our official DayZ Instagram account. There, you can occasionaly find some photos from our office and more, just follow us! http://i.imgur.com/LEvl61g.jpg This is everything for my part, I hope you like it!

Brian will outline our decisions about the distribution of servers for the future, Mirek will show you how close-range combat and camera collision look in 0.63, and Victor is talking about gun animations. Let's have a look! Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, I thought this Status Report would be a perfect time to clarify some things with the hive, and the server browser for those that may have missed me speaking about it in 2016. I'm sure some of you may have noticed that the production team recently made the move to separate the Official DayZ servers into their own section of the hive, independent from the community hosted public servers. (Albeit with some difficulty on the game server provider side of properly configuring those community rented publics). One of the things Peter and I sat down and talked about when we looked at how we wanted the server browser to look moving into Beta and beyond, was making it crystal clear for new and existing users what servers were official, and what were user run (as well as modded, of course). Tied into this was a need to divide progression made on user hosted servers from progression on the official DayZ experience. Allowing folks to rent servers introduced a good deal of potential methods to exploit how localized server storage operates, which in turn can flood the public hive with ill-gotten gear. Trying to tackle this by limiting what can be done on the hosting side in the end just limits more and more what those server operators can do, and puts an unneeded responsibility on the limited support resources that are available. For me (and I think I can safely say for Peter as well) we needed to be certain what the initial experience a new user to DayZ would be experiencing. From a design perspective, it is very hard to be certain exactly what new users are encountering if we aren't clearly presenting them with a straight path to an official experience the first time they play the game. Sure, naming conventions for official servers worked okay for a bit - but at a certain point it just turns into tribal knowledge. The users who have been around for a while, or those who came from the mod understand, but new users can find it daunting. This is why when putting together the first mockups of the new server browser we made sure to earmark a few things:  Separating Official, Community, and Modded servers into their own tabs  Splitting the Official Servers off from the rest of the public hive to be certain the experience in them comes from them alone  Maintaining the public hive on rented servers to continue that tradition of a shared character across many DayZ servers  When the new server browser finally gets to the point in which these tabs are in and functional, the whole layout will make much more sense to existing and new users. The first thing they (new users) should experience is DayZ exactly as the developers had intended it. Obviously, if said new user has friends on a community or modded server he/she can navigate there easily. I know it seems like a small thing in the grand scheme of the whole project, and probably fairly trivial given the massive undertaking that beta is with the animation system, new user actions, and so on - but the devil is in the details and as far as I'm concerned, we as a development team needed to take steps to make it easier to understand, and get into the official Bohemia Interactive run experience. Allow folks to easily know what servers they can be certain persistence isn't reset on, and so forth. The rest of the team will have more interesting and exciting things to talk about this week I'm sure - but I wanted to make sure I took time to address these in progress changes to the organization of the hive, and its intent. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hey Guys, 0.62 has hit stable and we tried to livestream after a longer period of time to start practicing for what lies ahead. Hope you liked it!  The strike team for this patch will join rest of our efforts here and march on with BETA tasks forward. That said, for 0.62 you can expect a bit more fixes to the most crucial issues that we can reasonably look into, rolling them to experimental and stable over time. Some of the changes I`ve seen today to coloring of the map and vegetation are amazing. I`m very happy with the visuals that guys have been able to produce. Were also looking into server crashes from storage (persistance) corruption, vehicle tweaks and server browser separation as mentioned by Brian. But there are limits to what we can offer in reasonable time for the old client. The track for BETA has moved forward and keeps its focus on weapons and gunplay. So discussions on handling particles, state machines and weapon manipulation are always happening around the office with all people handling their parts of the game in all the features that are on their way for BETA. Since there is not that much to report in terms of scope or change of focus. I'll share some interesting stories or problems we have been dealing with in the past two weeks. One of the bigger issues that is bothering us right now is tied to animation of weapons. As the technology changes you have details that can only be built when rest of the modules are in place and testable. Looking at the internal build of the game there are some funny bugs all around the new stuff that one might get a good laugh from but there is no way they can make it live. While player is animating properly and even uses inverse kinematics in the new modules, configs are getting set up, player turns are tweaked. There are elements on weapons that need to be animated as well. It's one of the older parts of the engine originally and if any of the modders remember. Animating proxies on weapons have been done through configuration files and in text. We're moving away from that, but because how tied it is to some of the not refactored parts we are encountering some interesting things from parts of weapons flying around to being invisible at times. There apparently is still something left that has not been identified properly and we need to solve it as soon as possible. Refactoring something as large as RV engine certainly has its challenges and these things are hard to predict with codebase that old. Even from a knowhow standpoint it's not about the skills of the programmer himself, but rather the lack of documentation or knowledge how the previous system has been setup, and why. And as such the debugging of these issues takes time and going forward we want to eliminate as much of the smaller details that are still set up the old way.  Its hours of research and digging from unknown code. And some of you might have a experience doing that. On the other hand were also battling the stability of the application itself. As all of you have been plagued by memory crashes, which are very hard to diagnose properly and fix. I have stories of similar issues even taking a year to debug from different projects I had pleasure working with. However were very much focusing on it with internal build as even the development environment gets very frustrating when you can`t iterate without crash sneaking up on you at random times. Funny thing is when you look at callstacks from these crashes, they usually just end up in memory sensitive parts of the engine, but the actual issue might have happened minutes before. And tracking it down is an enormous undertaking. We're not taking these issues lightly as for BETA none of these hard stoppers should be present. To give a glance at the currently open development items in our teams:  Programmers • UI Inputs bugfixes • Communication systems optimization • Weapon handling and aiming • Vehicle physics refactor • Vehicle controller refactor • 3rd person camera collision changes • FNX basic state machine and script class tweaking • IZH18 basic state machine and script class tweaking • Animation events for player • Physics collision system refactor and optimization • Melee damage types • Different damage levels in selections • Attachments refactor • Animals spawning • AI hierarchy refactor • Tons of crash fixing • Tons of bug fixes Animators • Throwing animations • Two handed hit reactions • Player turns for pistols • Rifle hit reactions • IZH18 animation tweaks • Combat player graph  Designers • Fireplace new particle system implementation • Traps with grenades • Drag and drop for final inventory design • Player action targeting and floating cursor • Communication systems • Quantity refactor • Advanced placing system tweaks • Construction watchtower • Animation events for player • New zombie models • New player models • Animation events for player • Server browser separation • Area damage • Crafting framework • Vehicle tweaks  Audio • Positional environment audio tweaks • Infected audio recording preparation • Player and weapon animation events setup  QA • Playtesting the 0.62 update • 0.62 feature testing • Internal client stabilization  Art • Old assets rework • Buildings optimization • Doors unification • Weapon tweaks for new gunplay • Car wrecks • New rock formations • Color tweaks for Chernarus - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter As we want to accent official DayZ experience vs community one in long run, we separated shards for official and community servers with release of the 0.62 version. Now with upcoming update for 0.62 you will see this change reflected in server browser too. Instead of one 'Internet' tab there are now two tabs to make it clear. First 'Official' tab with all servers operated directly by Bohemia Interactive, while second 'Community' tab pools all servers rented by users. Further work is being made on crafting system. Now, with item in hands, it's possible to initiate crafting and choose between recipes directly looking at another item in the world, or from the quick bar by holding a slot where said item is assigned. Such possibilities for crafting will help to minimize inventory use. On the other side of core features spectrum, we are working hard in close cooperation with animators and programmers on ranged and melee combat. Focus is currently mostly on the aiming model for firearms (weapon handling part is being worked on in parallel of course), which is combination of hands IK, character turns, it ensures that weapon is always pointing what you are looking at, that model also handles sights misalignment, sway which could be modified by character state from modifiers to stamina and hold breath, and recoil modified by weapon's attachments. Light and heavy hit impacts are now connected to hit events and are played character being hit from both types of combat. We would like to add one more hit impact to the mix which is a knockdown to the ground at the end of combo. You can read more about upcoming new melee combat in one of past Status Reports. I will get back to firearms in more detail in some upcoming Status Reports. Do you remember that injured animation shown in our official DayZ Early Access launch trailer from the end of 2013? We finally plugged in the injured set of animations to the new character and it directly reflects your health state. Additionally, we also added exhausted idle animation which is connected to the stamina system. With these changes, we are getting closer to our ideal state where it should be easy to observe other character to see what they are actually doing and to judge their overall condition. Believe what you see... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek First of all, I would like to write about the 0.62 branch state. We have received some important data about client and server crashes, which should help us to stabilize the build present on the stable branch, so hopefully there will be stability improvements soon. We have also merged the fix candidate for floating vehicles and very important physics optimization. Currently, physics is consuming most of the CPU resources (at least on servers), so we hope this optimization will significantly improve server performance. These merges will be available on experimental branch today or tomorrow and we will be very happy if there will be enough players, so we will be able to confirm that this optimization is working well. On 0.63 - we're cooperating closely with designers and animators. The most of work goes into weapon manipulation now. This basically means we're creating new finite states machines for handling the weapon logic and connecting all weapon manipulation animations into these state machines. If everything goes right, we will show you how firing, reloading, chambering, unjamming and other mechanics look in the next status report. Another big part of the game - close range fight - is in progress. You saw some animations before, today I would like to show you how first hit animations are looking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXGX42HDYcI 3rd person camera collisions have received some tweaks last two weeks. We are trying to add some dynamics, when camera is obstructed - so here you can see some work in progress stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NykucZZRvdM Please keep in mind we're showing work in progress state, things can change during development and it's very likely that all these features will be tweaked also in the beta stage of development. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Viktor Today I would like to share with you an update from the animations department. In past weeks, we have been focused mainly on player character and weapons. The latest additions to the player are improved turns when standing still. For animations, this means improving and redoing turn animations for all items. We are iterating this now in cooperation with our animation programmer to find the best result that looks and feels good. Weapons have received some love as well. We have finished all unjamming animations, and we are focusing on implementation. First guns are now animated in the game. We are adding the missing animations like recoil and dry fire for each weapon. At the same time the logic for these firearms is being made so each weapon knows what the character can do with it. Basically, we need to cover all the states the weapon can have and provide animations for it. We have started implementing hit reactions for the player character. There will be light and heavy animation for each direction, each item and each stance. That is some decent amount of animation data, but we already have a working prototype in the game. Last but not least, there was small mocap session last week. We have captured some new gestures. Some of them are already implemented and some will be in the upcoming weeks. The gestures menu will now include new signals like Come, Watch, Down, Move, some new taunts and others that were requested by the community. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Adam As I have mentioned on the live-stream last week, we plan to include additional tweaks to the color of clutter (grass and other miscellaneous objects in forests) for the version 0.62 in the nearest stable update window. I'm glad to announce our environment designer Mark has prepared the first iteration of these changes and it is available on the experimental branch for you to check out. For the full list of changes made please visit the appropriate experimental thread on the official forums HERE. http://i.imgur.com/Pq1zdHR.jpg http://i.imgur.com/bjSdiUz.jpg http://i.imgur.com/97X3Hb2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/GS3uhFF.jpg http://i.imgur.com/pvOrhOh.jpg http://i.imgur.com/H0JMiEG.jpg -  Adam Franců / Senior map designer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors, So many things happened last week and we are glad everything turned out as planned, because we really made a lot of work on it. First, we organized an event for content creators and their friends on the new castle the West. It was a PVP event in which one side defended the castle and the other attacked it with the equipment they brought with them. 51 people joined the server, unfortunately not everyone managed to get to the castle, because some of them were killed by wolves or by infected, which are simply the risks of the game. We had 14 members of the dev team there, including the lead designer Peter Nespesny and Sumrak, who is taking care of the Chernarus map and created the castle in which the event took place. The battle was really bloody and the defenders used all their strength to keep the attackers in front of the gates, but eventually succumbed and the attackers took the castle for themselves. I would like to congratulate the winners who earned their victory. How the event looked through the eyes of the attackers can be seen in a video by Jakon72: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OfzTrJ4vW4 Some of the participants in a group photo before start of the battle. http://i.imgur.com/UcveKH3.jpg  Photo of the winners who conquered the castle by Redseven. http://i.imgur.com/coxSflK.jpg Thanks so much to all who attended and we are looking forward to seeing you again on another event.  We were running live stream in our office at the same time as the event. We announced the switch of 0.62 update from the Experimental branch to the Stable branch. Lead producer Eugen Harton, lead designer Peter Nespesny, senior map designer Adam Francu and brand manager Martin Čulák jointly discussed what you can expect from the update 0.62 and other interesting topics. In case you missed it, you can find the video on our YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yhpG-naXPA We also released a video that shows the main features of the new update. If you have not seen it, you should definitely watch it because it is very good and it does not take you more than two minutes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsP11VEZCa8 I would also like to address my colleagues' request from the Feedback Tracker. We need to get as much information as possible about the crashes that happen to you on the Stable and Experimental branches. Therefore, I am asking you to contact our Feedback Tracker in case of crash and upload files from the C:\\Users\\YourPCName\\AppData\\Local\\DayZ folder to help to solve the crash problems. We would like to thank for the reports about leather not getting tanned in barrels. Over the weekend you came up with an incredible number of tickets for this issue and we are just looking into it now. And of course, if you encounter any other bugs, we will be happy if you report it to our Feedback Tracker.  Channel Pitstop Head made a two-part talk about DayZ with our creative director Brian Hicks, which is really interesting and can give you answers to some of the questions bothering you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-IUVCGV5XM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64SpKQJ2H7I&t=1287s And the last piece of community content I'd like to share with you is an amazing artwork by Dominik Figlhuber, who has been able to turn an ordinary DayZ screenshot into amazing art. Simply beautiful, thank you for sharing it with us! http://i.imgur.com/uHmHLba.jpg Original screenshot.  http://i.imgur.com/MdeANsx.jpg Waiting at daytime. Alternative edit.  http://i.imgur.com/vIltKfE.jpg Final edit. And one last thing, I would like to show you a photo I secretly photographed in the office when the designers were discussing weapons for the update 0.63. It's not of a good quality, but I thought you might be interested. And shhh, don't tell them, they do not like taking pictures. http://i.imgur.com/Z97EckY.jpg Thank you for your content survivors and see you in two weeks!

Brian will outline our decisions about the distribution of servers for the future, Mirek will show you how close-range combat and camera collision look in 0.63, and Victor is talking about gun animations. Let's have a look! Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, I thought this Status Report would be a perfect time to clarify some things with the hive, and the server browser for those that may have missed me speaking about it in 2016. I'm sure some of you may have noticed that the production team recently made the move to separate the Official DayZ servers into their own section of the hive, independent from the community hosted public servers. (Albeit with some difficulty on the game server provider side of properly configuring those community rented publics). One of the things Peter and I sat down and talked about when we looked at how we wanted the server browser to look moving into Beta and beyond, was making it crystal clear for new and existing users what servers were official, and what were user run (as well as modded, of course). Tied into this was a need to divide progression made on user hosted servers from progression on the official DayZ experience. Allowing folks to rent servers introduced a good deal of potential methods to exploit how localized server storage operates, which in turn can flood the public hive with ill-gotten gear. Trying to tackle this by limiting what can be done on the hosting side in the end just limits more and more what those server operators can do, and puts an unneeded responsibility on the limited support resources that are available. For me (and I think I can safely say for Peter as well) we needed to be certain what the initial experience a new user to DayZ would be experiencing. From a design perspective, it is very hard to be certain exactly what new users are encountering if we aren't clearly presenting them with a straight path to an official experience the first time they play the game. Sure, naming conventions for official servers worked okay for a bit - but at a certain point it just turns into tribal knowledge. The users who have been around for a while, or those who came from the mod understand, but new users can find it daunting. This is why when putting together the first mockups of the new server browser we made sure to earmark a few things:  Separating Official, Community, and Modded servers into their own tabs  Splitting the Official Servers off from the rest of the public hive to be certain the experience in them comes from them alone  Maintaining the public hive on rented servers to continue that tradition of a shared character across many DayZ servers  When the new server browser finally gets to the point in which these tabs are in and functional, the whole layout will make much more sense to existing and new users. The first thing they (new users) should experience is DayZ exactly as the developers had intended it. Obviously, if said new user has friends on a community or modded server he/she can navigate there easily. I know it seems like a small thing in the grand scheme of the whole project, and probably fairly trivial given the massive undertaking that beta is with the animation system, new user actions, and so on - but the devil is in the details and as far as I'm concerned, we as a development team needed to take steps to make it easier to understand, and get into the official Bohemia Interactive run experience. Allow folks to easily know what servers they can be certain persistence isn't reset on, and so forth. The rest of the team will have more interesting and exciting things to talk about this week I'm sure - but I wanted to make sure I took time to address these in progress changes to the organization of the hive, and its intent. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hey Guys, 0.62 has hit stable and we tried to livestream after a longer period of time to start practicing for what lies ahead. Hope you liked it!  The strike team for this patch will join rest of our efforts here and march on with BETA tasks forward. That said, for 0.62 you can expect a bit more fixes to the most crucial issues that we can reasonably look into, rolling them to experimental and stable over time. Some of the changes I`ve seen today to coloring of the map and vegetation are amazing. I`m very happy with the visuals that guys have been able to produce. Were also looking into server crashes from storage (persistance) corruption, vehicle tweaks and server browser separation as mentioned by Brian. But there are limits to what we can offer in reasonable time for the old client. The track for BETA has moved forward and keeps its focus on weapons and gunplay. So discussions on handling particles, state machines and weapon manipulation are always happening around the office with all people handling their parts of the game in all the features that are on their way for BETA. Since there is not that much to report in terms of scope or change of focus. I'll share some interesting stories or problems we have been dealing with in the past two weeks. One of the bigger issues that is bothering us right now is tied to animation of weapons. As the technology changes you have details that can only be built when rest of the modules are in place and testable. Looking at the internal build of the game there are some funny bugs all around the new stuff that one might get a good laugh from but there is no way they can make it live.

And some of you might have a experience doing that. On the other hand were also battling the stability of the application itself. As all of you have been plagued by memory crashes, which are very hard to diagnose properly and fix.

And tracking it down is an enormous undertaking. We're not taking these issues lightly as for BETA none of these hard stoppers should be present. To give a glance at the currently open development items in our teams:  Programmers • UI Inputs bugfixes • Communication systems optimization • Weapon handling and aiming • Vehicle physics refactor • Vehicle controller refactor • 3rd person camera collision changes • FNX basic state machine and script class tweaking • IZH18 basic state machine and script class tweaking • Animation events for player • Physics collision system refactor and optimization • Melee damage types • Different damage levels in selections • Attachments refactor • Animals spawning • AI hierarchy refactor • Tons of crash fixing • Tons of bug fixes Animators • Throwing animations • Two handed hit reactions • Player turns for pistols • Rifle hit reactions • IZH18 animation tweaks • Combat player graph  Designers • Fireplace new particle system implementation • Traps with grenades • Drag and drop for final inventory design • Player action targeting and floating cursor • Communication systems • Quantity refactor • Advanced placing system tweaks • Construction watchtower • Animation events for player • New zombie models • New player models • Animation events for player • Server browser separation • Area damage • Crafting framework • Vehicle tweaks  Audio • Positional environment audio tweaks • Infected audio recording preparation • Player and weapon animation events setup  QA • Playtesting the 0.62 update • 0.62 feature testing • Internal client stabilization  Art • Old assets rework • Buildings optimization • Doors unification • Weapon tweaks for new gunplay • Car wrecks • New rock formations • Color tweaks for Chernarus - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter As we want to accent official DayZ experience vs community one in long run, we separated shards for official and community servers with release of the 0.62 version. Now with upcoming update for 0.62 you will see this change reflected in server browser too. Instead of one 'Internet' tab there are now two tabs to make it clear. First 'Official' tab with all servers operated directly by Bohemia Interactive, while second 'Community' tab pools all servers rented by users. Further work is being made on crafting system. Now, with item in hands, it's possible to initiate crafting and choose between recipes directly looking at another item in the world, or from the quick bar by holding a slot where said item is assigned. Such possibilities for crafting will help to minimize inventory use. On the other side of core features spectrum, we are working hard in close cooperation with animators and programmers on ranged and melee combat. Focus is currently mostly on the aiming model for firearms (weapon handling part is being worked on in parallel of course), which is combination of hands IK, character turns, it ensures that weapon is always pointing what you are looking at, that model also handles sights misalignment, sway which could be modified by character state from modifiers to stamina and hold breath, and recoil modified by weapon's attachments. Light and heavy hit impacts are now connected to hit events and are played character being hit from both types of combat. We would like to add one more hit impact to the mix which is a knockdown to the ground at the end of combo. You can read more about upcoming new melee combat in one of past Status Reports. I will get back to firearms in more detail in some upcoming Status Reports. Do you remember that injured animation shown in our official DayZ Early Access launch trailer from the end of 2013? We finally plugged in the injured set of animations to the new character and it directly reflects your health state. Additionally, we also added exhausted idle animation which is connected to the stamina system. With these changes, we are getting closer to our ideal state where it should be easy to observe other character to see what they are actually doing and to judge their overall condition. Believe what you see... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek First of all, I would like to write about the 0.62 branch state. We have received some important data about client and server crashes, which should help us to stabilize the build present on the stable branch, so hopefully there will be stability improvements soon. We have also merged the fix candidate for floating vehicles and very important physics optimization. Currently, physics is consuming most of the CPU resources (at least on servers), so we hope this optimization will significantly improve server performance. These merges will be available on experimental branch today or tomorrow and we will be very happy if there will be enough players, so we will be able to confirm that this optimization is working well. On 0.63 - we're cooperating closely with designers and animators. The most of work goes into weapon manipulation now. This basically means we're creating new finite states machines for handling the weapon logic and connecting all weapon manipulation animations into these state machines. If everything goes right, we will show you how firing, reloading, chambering, unjamming and other mechanics look in the next status report. Another big part of the game - close range fight - is in progress. You saw some animations before, today I would like to show you how first hit animations are looking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXGX42HDYcI 3rd person camera collisions have received some tweaks last two weeks. We are trying to add some dynamics, when camera is obstructed - so here you can see some work in progress stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NykucZZRvdM Please keep in mind we're showing work in progress state, things can change during development and it's very likely that all these features will be tweaked also in the beta stage of development. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Viktor Today I would like to share with you an update from the animations department. In past weeks, we have been focused mainly on player character and weapons. The latest additions to the player are improved turns when standing still. For animations, this means improving and redoing turn animations for all items. We are iterating this now in cooperation with our animation programmer to find the best result that looks and feels good. Weapons have received some love as well. We have finished all unjamming animations, and we are focusing on implementation. First guns are now animated in the game. We are adding the missing animations like recoil and dry fire for each weapon. At the same time the logic for these firearms is being made so each weapon knows what the character can do with it. Basically, we need to cover all the states the weapon can have and provide animations for it. We have started implementing hit reactions for the player character. There will be light and heavy animation for each direction, each item and each stance. That is some decent amount of animation data, but we already have a working prototype in the game. Last but not least, there was small mocap session last week. We have captured some new gestures. Some of them are already implemented and some will be in the upcoming weeks. The gestures menu will now include new signals like Come, Watch, Down, Move, some new taunts and others that were requested by the community. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Adam As I have mentioned on the live-stream last week, we plan to include additional tweaks to the color of clutter (grass and other miscellaneous objects in forests) for the version 0.62 in the nearest stable update window. I'm glad to announce our environment designer Mark has prepared the first iteration of these changes and it is available on the experimental branch for you to check out.

First, we organized an event for content creators and their friends on the new castle the West. It was a PVP event in which one side defended the castle and the other attacked it with the equipment they brought with them. 51 people joined the server, unfortunately not everyone managed to get to the castle, because some of them were killed by wolves or by infected, which are simply the risks of the game. We had 14 members of the dev team there, including the lead designer Peter Nespesny and Sumrak, who is taking care of the Chernarus map and created the castle in which the event took place. The battle was really bloody and the defenders used all their strength to keep the attackers in front of the gates, but eventually succumbed and the attackers took the castle for themselves. I would like to congratulate the winners who earned their victory. How the event looked through the eyes of the attackers can be seen in a video by Jakon72: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OfzTrJ4vW4 Some of the participants in a group photo before start of the battle. http://i.imgur.com/UcveKH3.jpg  Photo of the winners who conquered the castle by Redseven. http://i.imgur.com/coxSflK.jpg Thanks so much to all who attended and we are looking forward to seeing you again on another event.  We were running live stream in our office at the same time as the event. We announced the switch of 0.62 update from the Experimental branch to the Stable branch. Lead producer Eugen Harton, lead designer Peter Nespesny, senior map designer Adam Francu and brand manager Martin Čulák jointly discussed what you can expect from the update 0.62 and other interesting topics. In case you missed it, you can find the video on our YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yhpG-naXPA We also released a video that shows the main features of the new update. If you have not seen it, you should definitely watch it because it is very good and it does not take you more than two minutes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsP11VEZCa8 I would also like to address my colleagues' request from the Feedback Tracker. We need to get as much information as possible about the crashes that happen to you on the Stable and Experimental branches. Therefore, I am asking you to contact our Feedback Tracker in case of crash and upload files from the C:\\Users\\YourPCName\\AppData\\Local\\DayZ folder to help to solve the crash problems. We would like to thank for the reports about leather not getting tanned in barrels. Over the weekend you came up with an incredible number of tickets for this issue and we are just looking into it now. And of course, if you encounter any other bugs, we will be happy if you report it to our Feedback Tracker.  Channel Pitstop Head made a two-part talk about DayZ with our creative director Brian Hicks, which is really interesting and can give you answers to some of the questions bothering you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-IUVCGV5XM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64SpKQJ2H7I&t=1287s And the last piece of community content I'd like to share with you is an amazing artwork by Dominik Figlhuber, who has been able to turn an ordinary DayZ screenshot into amazing art. Simply beautiful, thank you for sharing it with us! http://i.imgur.com/uHmHLba.jpg Original screenshot.  http://i.imgur.com/MdeANsx.jpg Waiting at daytime. Alternative edit.  http://i.imgur.com/vIltKfE.jpg Final edit. And one last thing, I would like to show you a photo I secretly photographed in the office when the designers were discussing weapons for the update 0.63. It's not of a good quality, but I thought you might be interested. And shhh, don't tell them, they do not like taking pictures. http://i.imgur.com/Z97EckY.jpg Thank you for your content survivors and see you in two weeks!

Peter and Eugen are sharing some of the work being currently done for BETA, and Baty is sharing her top picks of all the amazing content you created since 0.62 released last week. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Andrej Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, This Status Report, I don't have a whole ton for you. Obviously, 95% of the team is focused on 0.63 and getting it to a point in which we can begin testing on Experimental branch for that build. As some of you may not be aware, 0.62 recently hit Experimental, and the team has pulled a lot of good and actionable bug data from that build, as well as some strong feedback in regards to the first iteration of the new ambient audio. You'll all be pleased to know that every bit of feedback regarding said new ambient audio is being investigated, and the audio team will be able to iterate upon some of that feedback. Any up to date progress we make will always be posted by Baty in the Experimental Patch Discussion section of the forums. The team is currently tracking feedback in regards to the following on 0.62 Experimental: Misc feedback in regards to audio volume, general audio system behavior Behavior of some trees in the wind  There are also some attempted fixes included in today's Experimental update regardin: Collisions with some tree models Ironsights sometimes backing off after a few seconds Issues binding some mouse keys  I'm sure Eugen will have some more meat on the bone when it comes to the progress on 0.63 itself. I for one am really, really anticipating being able to share the functionality of 0.63. Stay safe out there! - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hey guys! So 0.62 Experimental happened and I can't thank you enough for the amazing content that you created with the new visuals for forests. There are many improvements that will still be coming to visuals over time - like reworking old low-quality assets and adding new features to the map as mentioned in Adam's Q&A video. It is a good showcase of the quality we aim for in both the visuals and gameplay for the 0.63/BETA release. I mentioned a couple of things here previously that have now come in motion, full force. We have progressed and started working on smaller feature sets that will define gameplay of the BETA. One of the largest topics of discussion in the offices have been weapons and their handling for the new player. To understand what that means I have to sadly hit you with a large wall of text. When you look at the live game, and what is happening on stable/experimental, you still see (for the most part) a content that is running on old technology. Since for BETA release, we have expanded the gunplay beyond what was possible previously, it means many things will be changing, and many have been mentioned here. However, to give you a sense of scale. The work on the new animation system and all of its features took almost a year and a half of work. Animations for all of your weapons, with variations from continuous reloading, chambering, magazine manipulation, jamming, and more, took probably over a year in itself. All that culminating with implementation of aiming model that will support better implementation of recoil, sway, player turns, and even heavily improved manipulation of weapons in different stances. A whole lot of our content is starting to get implemented - as I said before, we're finally making a game, instead of fully focusing on the technology. In the list below, I mention FNX and IZH18 - two weapons that are the first to be handled using these new systems. And I can't wait to have a shootout here with the guys once these are fully working internally. For all these things: User actions that enable player to interact with items and objects, weapons included Synchronization setup that is largely inspired by what Overwatch did for their networking Animation system that will make your avatar a living breathing human Damage system that is easily tweakable and supports all sorts of hitzones, impact animations New particle effects and sounds New character representation with all the things actually creating a survival experience  It's not that we don't expect bugs from their first iterations, but the reality for us is, that we have been working for 4 years now on things that you couldn't get your hands on in-game as of yet. And as the list of features above shows, all these systems can't really work without each other. Even the new network synchronization is optimized for the new player and new physics. It makes me sad that it couldn't happen sooner, but I believe we will have a great game for you with 0.63/BETA. To give a glance at the currently open development items in our teams: Programmers • UI Inputs • Communication systems (megaphone, static radio, public address system) • Weapon handling and aiming • Vehicle physics refactor • Vehicle controller refactor • 3rd person camera collision changes • FNX basic state machine and script class • IZH18 basic state machine and script class • Animation events for player • Performance optimizations for item spawning • Physics collision system refactor and optimization • Tons of crash fixing • Tons of bug fixes Animators • Weapon mechanics animations polishing (unjamming, reloads) • Inverse Kinematics poses • Hit reactions on player • Ranged combat prototype • Player turns tweaking Designers • User actions in multiplayer • Player representation • New player and item spawn definition • Player action targeting and floating cursor • Communication systems • Tree collisions fixes • Advanced placing system • Construction watchtower • Diseases refactor for new player representation • Animation events for player • New zombie models • New player models • Animation events for player Audio • Positional environment audio tweaks • Infected audio recording preparation • Player and weapon animation events setup QA • Playtesting the 0.62 update • 0.62 feature testing • Internal client stabilization • User actions for 0.63 testing Art • Old assets rework • Buildings optimization • Doors unification These are thousands of hours spent on our side to bring a dream that is yet to be fully realized. Curiosity, Creativity, Community. Three pillars of Bohemia Interactive that we want to uphold. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter Among plenty of other issues we face, picking items from the world is another one which is far from ideal in its current state. Aiming precisely with cursor on items could be fine, unless you run into some annoyances. Some items are rendered too small on the screen because of their close-to-real-life dimensions, and they are often being obstructed with other objects in world like dense grass, and tend to mimic underlying surface textures. You know the drill, many times it's difficult to find a pistol, or even a rifle in some cases, and pick it up (I don't even want to mention special cases like ammo piles). At the end, such frustration leads to the use of the vicinity part of inventory screen as the path of the least resistance. Each open of the inventory screen disrupts the immersion of being right there for you as a player, and if I count in movement during opening the inventory (leading to jogging in chaotic patterns to find that damn ammo pile), it's breaking immersion also for all observers who had to look at your misery. Along with restriction of character movement while in inventory, we added dynamic selection of target, which evaluates conditions such as distance from player, screen center and angle. Selected target is then visually marked by snapping interaction icon to it in screen space. We went beyond items and similarly, we applied this system also to interaction with vehicles and static objects in world like doors or ladders. I like fluid interconnection of a gven item and the action which it brings to the table. It feels natural and adds to the physicality of the world - it even feels closer to hand to use your eyes for coordination, instead of rigorous movement with whole head around. You can see it in action on examples below. https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPeQAPUWmMwgds4/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPvSaw9FwQbMFd6/giphy.gif Maybe you are wondering now, why we just simply didn't apply highlighting to items and objects? Apart from highlights being quite artificial and also immersion breaking, they are not solving one of the problems mentioned above - frequent necessity to pixel hunt with your center of the screen. But never say never, maybe there will be some very decent version of highlighting in future to make it more seamless and to pop up items a bit, even when I'm not kinda fan of it. Dynamic target selection is still in progress and there are some small issues we need to solve, for example shaking of icon caused currently by insufficient frequency of UI updates on client side. However, from first tests of its current iteration, it feels really good, and what matters the most - it's very helpful! They will not hide anymore... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Adam Almost a week since 0.62 update release on Experimental branch - I hope that you are having a good time exploring the new Chernarus! First, I would like to give you a small insight into what is happening in our department, mainly what are our plans towards the Stable release of update 0.62. Additional improvements and fixes to the surface mask - to resolve issues such as forest clutter appearance in the middle of industrial area in Solnichniy Satellite texture and ground clutter changes - decreasing overall brightness along with other tweaks (aimed at improving visuals of short and tall grass) Lighting config tweaks Map improvements and fixes  Now I would like to talk a bit about client performance on the new Chernarus. So far, we have observed quite positive reception from the experimental branch testing - everyone is welcomed there, please report if you encounter any issues on feedback tracker. As I already mentioned in previous Status Reports, the introduction of Enfusion renderer back in update 0.60 gave us quite a big room for possible landscape improvements in many parts of Chernarus. Goal of update .62 was to use this room (where possible) to improve visual fidelity of Chernarus. Many of the existing locations on Chernarus increased in detail drastically and while the new vegetation assets are much better optimized than the old ones, it will still most likely end up with the same or slightly decreased performance. Now I would like to say that nothing is settled at this point. From the data point of view, we are still using some legacy vegetation assets (such as bushes and few selected solitary trees). This is however just a temporary arrangement, as replacements will be coming in future updates and will of course result in performance increase in almost all areas (old bushes are used around the whole map even in update 0.62). There are more optimizations on data side planned (mainly related to buildings and the use of textures). For update 0.63, we have changed completely the whole structure for environment assets, which mainly makes loading faster, but it also makes data more readable, and this will ultimately make the lives of future community modders simpler. On the programming side, there are optimizations on their way (starting with update 0.63), from which both PC and console versions will benefit greatly. Unfortunately, given the current differences between internal and public branches, it is not feasible to merge any complicated code in short time, and while we are already observing a better performance on internal branch, none of those improvements can be merged back into 0.62 branch. http://i.imgur.com/EB49LAd.jpg - Adam Franců / Senior Map Designer  Dev Update/Andrej We're happy to say our new ambient audio is finally out on experimental. We have rebuilt all ambient sounds and added positional sound effects on the vegetation. We are now testing the mix, repetition cycles and we're listening to feedback from you and the QA department, so expect a lot of tweaks before the stable release. We are also preparing positional SFX for the buildings but that will have to wait till 0.63 because of some subtle changes to building models. Apart form ambient sounds, we're actively working on BETA preparation where we have thousands of new sounds for the new player and user actions. There is an audio recording session planned for next month where we're gonna record new sounds for players, as well as infected. We're also working closely with animation department, so you can expect many new SFX for every new animation that will come with the 0.63 update. - Andrej Sinkević / Sound Designer  Community Spotlight Hello guys! We released the update 0.62 to Experimental branch in the night hours last week and we were holding our breath waiting for your first reactions. When we checked first streams to see your impressions, we were very happy and relieved. You were excited by this new update! New trees, ambient sound, wind - you loved it and you were sharing your experience with us on social networks, which we really appreciate. When you work on something like this for a long time, you are happy when people like your hard work. http://i.imgur.com/x7NTJaL.png http://i.imgur.com/Auiv3zL.png http://i.imgur.com/TlxvTn8.png We really appreciated your feedback. It is helping us to move closer to the release of the 0.62 to Stable branch. We are still looking for issues, if you find any bugs or if your game crashes, please report it to our Feedback Tracker, our QA guys will take care of you. If you never tried an Experimental branch and you want to play on unstable servers, we have instructions for you on our official forums: https://forums.dayz.com/topic/177199-experimental-branch-testing-how-to/ If you never heard about new 0.62 update and If you want to know what is new, here is the list of the most important things: New tree models Denser forests New clutter (grass, small plants) New surface textures - plains and such Improved wind behavior New shader for the wind, affecting trees and grass Tweaked and changed lighting for the world Small improvements to satellite textures Rain affected by wind and refinement of its behavior in general Many reworked locations on Chernarus Reworked ghillie (to be consistent with new tech) Small bugfixes to some issues from 0.61 New ambient sounds  We are talking about the new update in depth on our forums, join us and tell us your feedback, positive or negative, it's up to you: https://forums.dayz.com/topic/236800-exp-update-062139507/ With the arrival of 0.62, a lot of videos started appearing on YouTube, introducing the new update. I admit that so many of them were so good, I was having a hard time choosing the ones to show you today. Finally, I picked a great story by Rene a.k.a. Barely Infected, which contains exploration of new locations in the west, telling of scary stories at dark night as well as creating new friendships. It is a bit longer, but believe me that it is worth it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcb05uYqYrg Another video I wanted to show you is a snapshot movie from a smaller, but very skilled YouTuber called uncuepagamer, that shows the beauty of the small village Nizhnoye and its surroundings. Those few shots are enough to capture the great looks of the new update. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4rFzDBZ8co If you like events, do note that there will be one taking place on the 7th June 2017 on French server Team ONU. You can find more info about it here. http://i.imgur.com/yf4sZKh.jpg At the end, I would like to remind you about the video from last week which some of you may have missed due to the hustle around the new update release. It is the first part of Q&A video with our senior map designer Adam Franců. Make sure to check it out, you will learn a lot of interesting information and you will find the promised scenes from \"real Chernarus\" I mentioned in the last Status Report. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxyAQ4B9xys That is all from me for today, if you are preparing an event on your server, or if you have any interesting content for the next Status Report, send me a Tweet on our official Twitter and you may find it here the next time.

It is helping us to move closer to the release of the 0.62 to Stable branch. We are still looking for issues, if you find any bugs or if your game crashes, please report it to our Feedback Tracker, our QA guys will take care of you. If you never tried an Experimental branch and you want to play on unstable servers, we have instructions for you on our official forums: https://forums.dayz.com/topic/177199-experimental-branch-testing-how-to/ If you never heard about new 0.62 update and If you want to know what is new, here is the list of the most important things: New tree models Denser forests New clutter (grass, small plants) New surface textures - plains and such Improved wind behavior New shader for the wind, affecting trees and grass Tweaked and changed lighting for the world Small improvements to satellite textures Rain affected by wind and refinement of its behavior in general Many reworked locations on Chernarus Reworked ghillie (to be consistent with new tech) Small bugfixes to some issues from 0.61 New ambient sounds  We are talking about the new update in depth on our forums, join us and tell us your feedback, positive or negative, it's up to you: https://forums.dayz.com/topic/236800-exp-update-062139507/ With the arrival of 0.62, a lot of videos started appearing on YouTube, introducing the new update. I admit that so many of them were so good, I was having a hard time choosing the ones to show you today. Finally, I picked a great story by Rene a.k.a. Barely Infected, which contains exploration of new locations in the west, telling of scary stories at dark night as well as creating new friendships. It is a bit longer, but believe me that it is worth it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcb05uYqYrg Another video I wanted to show you is a snapshot movie from a smaller, but very skilled YouTuber called uncuepagamer, that shows the beauty of the small village Nizhnoye and its surroundings. Those few shots are enough to capture the great looks of the new update. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4rFzDBZ8co If you like events, do note that there will be one taking place on the 7th June 2017 on French server Team ONU. You can find more info about it here. http://i.imgur.com/yf4sZKh.jpg At the end, I would like to remind you about the video from last week which some of you may have missed due to the hustle around the new update release. It is the first part of Q&A video with our senior map designer Adam Franců. Make sure to check it out, you will learn a lot of interesting information and you will find the promised scenes from \"real Chernarus\" I mentioned in the last Status Report. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxyAQ4B9xys That is all from me for today, if you are preparing an event on your server, or if you have any interesting content for the next Status Report, send me a Tweet on our official Twitter and you may find it here the next time.

Eugen is touching upon the complexity of DayZ, as well as some of the recent tasks of the entire team. We also feature Peter who shares exciting news about changing the inner workings of loot spawns (this will be an extra crunchy topic for any future DayZ modders out there!) Next up are our map designers Mark and Adam, and yes, they have some screenshots for you this time! To finish it all of in style, Baty is sharing a couple of photos from our trip to the real Chernarus, where we were filming the upcoming Q&A video last week. Let's get to it, it's a long one folks, but full of great development news! Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Adam Dev Update/Mark Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks The last time we spoke I mentioned discussing the impact of sway, and the implications on gameplay. I think one of the overlooked aspects of replacing the animation system, and legacy player is the fact that this isn't just a \"change\" in how sway / hold breath, and the likes behave. With the legacy setup, early on Peter and I both supported adjustments to try and refine where it was sitting as an experience in game. Pretty rapidly we realized that where we wanted it to be, and what the technology would allow us to do were two things very much apart. Rather than wasting development time trying to iterate and iterate upon a system that was slated to be replaced, the focus was placed on functionally where we wanted to be with the final product. Its important to understand that as I said earlier - this isn't just a change. This is a replacement of the technology and player - so the old methods for sway, stamina, and such are gone. As we move towards beta, and start getting those builds into the hands of players - then we can refine the new methods of sway, and get it to a point in which you still need to be aware of your stance, weight (hopefully!), and the amount of sprinting you are doing - but that it is entirely manageable and does not feel like this daunting and overwhelming rigid inflexibility it can become in some situations with the current legacy Steam builds. In addition to this, Peter and I have also been spending some time discussing the implication of server wide chat (specifically VOIP). I've noticed aside from strong private shard communities like DayZ Underground - folks don't seem to be utilizing radios in game. While on servers such as that, I find the communication across the map with random players occurs far more often. Personally, I'm a firm supporter of radios being starting gear so that every player can opt-in to server wide communication should they choose it - but I'm still working on converting Peter to this mindset. One of the limiting factors I've noticed the community discussing is the rate at which radios consume batteries, and the hunt for batteries themselves being both unrewarding and difficult. I know a lot of folks have expressed a desire for the old global chat (which personally I do not miss at all) - and some have also expressed an interest in the old kill feed. A default on global chat is just not something we ever felt had a place in DayZ. That said, it can easily be turned on for mod authors, a kill feed as well shouldn't be difficult to put together. For Peter and I - the immersion of the radios themselves, paired with the fact that they effectively serve as an opt-in global VOIP, is incredibly attractive. As I'm sure you all recall - we increased their range greatly several builds back. Aside from availability of the radios themselves, and consumption of batteries, I think they represent where we'd like global VOIP to be. So I encourage you all to utilize them more, so I can convince Peter that they should totally be player starting gear. C'mon - do it. You never know who will be on the other end. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hey guys! First things first, I want to share the conclusion to the story I mentioned here the last time! We managed to fix the crash - yay! This means that everything seems to be in place for 0.62 on Experimental and I can't wait for you guys to play with the new environment visuals and sounds. There is still space to improve and make things more distinct, but the work does not stop there after we send 0.62 to Experimental/Stable. It's the first step to get visuals and audio where one would expect them in 2017. To continue with stories from the development front, large part of our daily routine here is planning for BETA, and doing recaps with the aim to refocus the development, structuring our team into smaller feature teams. In the last two weeks, we revisited mind maps of these feature blocks to set up a core functionality of DayZ - starting with larger ones, and working our way down to smaller, more actionable items that we can \"close\" as development items. DayZ is a complex game. It's a system sandbox where its gameplay loop starts working only when all the small details are in, and start interacting with each other. It's one of the hardest genres to iterate upon, as you can't structure the features easily, and every single thing can break the gameplay ecosystem. I highly recommend the original Deus Ex postmortem that was featured at GDC 2017 by Warren Spector himself. If you separate the work we have done over the years, you can simplify it into three layers: engine, data and gameplay. Engine is the core base and modules upon which we want to build this game, data are visual assets (e.g. models) or audio that support the features, and gameplay is represented in both code and script. That’s why we have technical designers writing script, and gameplay programmers doing the same for the DayZ codebase. Over the course of the last two years, these two groups (programmers and scripters) have been focused on closing core support systems for the architecture of gameplay in the new engine, and haven't had the chance to see their individual parts of the game work together. It's exciting now that what you could previously see only in a debug mode, or under parameters for internal client, is now finally able to support actual gameplay, and can be seen inside the game in a broader context. It’s a start of something much bigger for everybody in here. Instead of focusing on systems and technology, we are finally making a game. The core gameplay loop is our focus now, split into melee combat, ranged combat, player character and its interaction with the world, and the infected (and their interactions with the world). All these pieces we have been building are slowly getting playable. There are still hurdles along the way and ahead of us - but that’s how development works. What we're doing now is obviously one of the most critical parts of DayZ development, but all these previous decisions to create tech first, and focus on enjoyable experience later, are going to benefit the game (and gameplay) in the long run. To give a glance at the currently open development items in our teams : Programmers • AI script implementation • Zombie behavior script representation • Inventory and item conditions • Item spawn definition • User actions in multiplayer • Network traffic optimization • Sound event manager • Performance optimizations and multithreading changes • Input changes • Navigation changes • Hit reactions on player • Tons of crash fixing • Tons of bug fixes Animators • Weapon mechanics animations polishing (unjamming, reloads) • Inverse Kinematics poses • Hit reactions on player • Melee combat prototype • Ranged combat prototype Designers • User actions in multiplayer • Player representation • New player and item spawn definition • Inventory UI refactor • Radial menu for gestures • Soft Skills • Player action targeting Audio • Positional environment audio • Infected audio recording preparation • Player and weapon animation events setup QA • Playtesting the 0.62 update • 0.62 feature testing • Internal client stabilization Art • Tree fire geometry • Buildings optimization • Doors unification - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter In regards to Central Economy, there were some changes made in terms of loot spawning and its definition for BETA version that we are working on. Till now, loot placement was defined directly as specific point per one item in .p3d files, grouped in named selections (which are paired with categories and tags in configs and areas in area map later). There has been a need to pay close attention to dimensions of given items against each other, and available space around them to avoid unnecessary clipping between items, or between item and building itself. This process was tedious as it lacked sufficient spatial orientation in object editor, leading to prolonged time needed to populate a building (for example, the school building has tens of thousands of spawn points defined in the old system). Not to mention that packing and exporting proxies was mandatory in order to be able to see new/adjusted spawn points working in game, stretching the time even further. You can see how it was set for the police station on the screenshot below. http://i.imgur.com/yvtsHaB.jpg Instead of exact points, the new loot placement uses ranges. Range simply defines a circular area within which item can be spawned. During placement of these ranges, they are checked against each other and building itself in real time. This approach avoids any clipping and collisions of items during spawning. Placement output is stored as XML directly in the mission folder, so it's very convenient for modding, it also can be loaded and edited. The best part of this new system is that it's completely defined and visualized directly in game, from free-fly camera. Additionally, everything is real time, which (coupled with independence from addons) cuts down the time required for setup dramatically. http://i.imgur.com/yqOrXuV.jpg After introduction of this new system, we managed to get from more than 1.000.000 spawn points (mind that was after massive reduction for 0.61 version from 4.000.000+ spawn points) to current ~130.000 used, and at the end, what matters the most is the increased server performance. Don't waste time doing unnecessary things... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer Dev Update/Mark Hi everyone, Mark Gill here! I'm one of the map designers who has done many tasks for Chernarus, but more recently I've been focused on developing the new Chernarus forests for this 0.62 visual upgrade. This has been a lengthy, challenging, but also rewarding process. I will try to share some of the thought process behind the changes that were made. http://i.imgur.com/Niat8Be.jpg With the new forest overhaul, we hope the survivor experience in DayZ will be greatly enhanced. We tried to make traveling through forests a more immersive experiance. Repetition can quickly become boring on a map of our scale, so as you traverse through forests across the map, the visuals will change at a fairly rapid pace. This was a large undertaking, but it was important to keep the visual stimuli changing in unpredictable ways. http://i.imgur.com/D693piO.jpg We were able to increase the number of tree variations thanks to our talented artists to create types of forest that display different characteristics. The overall shape, size, and canopy development gives sections of forest a sense of age. These sections can vary from close spacing of younger variants. to farther spacing of older variants. There are limits to density due to the performance impact, but hopefully the amount of variables at play will keep you on your toes as you travel across the map. http://i.imgur.com/KXZNUD6.jpg Broadleaf hedgerows and forest edges now have a lower profile than in the past. This looks more natural and adds more coverage at a lower height. With this change, sections of forest are more self-contained with this \"bushier\" egde-line. This helps block some sight in and out of deep forest. While much thinner then reality, this balanced result is an important improvement to the visuals as well as gameplay. Moving as an individual or group in and out forest should be a more significant shift as well as hiding. While you may feel safe and hidden within deep forest sections, there is also the opposite of not knowing who may be nearby. http://i.imgur.com/gefYWfW.jpg http://i.imgur.com/PhrVstf.jpg We hope you will enjoy your freshly upgraded playground! - Mark Gill/ Map Designer  Dev Update/Adam Hello everyone, I hope that you enjoyed this SR's contribution from Mark, our map designer, who has showed a great passion for such whopping task as transforming the nature of Chernarus is. He spend countless amount of time designing and configuring how the new forests and individual vegetation looks and we are all excited for the day when you finally be able to experience new Chernarus too. We are currently really busy with map tweaking to make sure we can deliver the new Chernarus in best possible shape we can in given time. Please keep in mind that update .62 has touched almost every corner of Chernarus and while we do our best to make sure everything will look just like we wanted, there will be some minor map-related issues. Also, keep in mind that update .62 contains initial changes to the whole western border, completely getting rid of old terrain and object layout and replacing it with much more detailed landscape and layout. This work, labelled as western expansion, is however split into several phases and more additions and fixes are planned for later updates. http://i.imgur.com/sCCqUv0.jpg In addition to many great improvements to the way grass, trees look and behave in wind, our programmers also went and fixed many issues related to lighting and sky. One of the major things was that before 062, shadows were turned off too early / too late and that impacted the quality of scene (mainly interiors) in a very bad way. This issue was fixed along with many more (like smoother sky-fog transition, reduced size of the moon and sun, moon visibility, horizon look, and more...). These changes have enabled us to focus on lighting config for Chernarus, which saw some great changes. While we do not consider it to be final, we hope that it will prove to be a very fitting addition to the visual update coming with 0.62. http://i.imgur.com/Z2DSdBG.jpg Additionally, in January 24th SR I promised you that I will show you the new railway stone bridge, so here it is! Coming in 0.62 along with many additional changes to the railway network of Chernarus! http://i.imgur.com/Xu1ApDz.jpg See you in Chernarus! - Adam Franců / Senior Map Designer  Community Spotlight Last week, together with our Brand Manager Martin and our external camera crew, we embarked to the real world model for Chernarus to shoot a new Q&A video with our Map Designer Adam Franců a.k.a Sumrak (a well known Arma 3 modder). The real Chernarus is found in the vicinity of the town of Ústi nad Labem in the Czech Republic and we already talked about it in the March Status Report. As a first thing we aimed for the \"Pik Kozlova\" (or Kozí vrch in the real world), which offers beautiful view of the outskirts of Ústi nad Labem that you most likely know from the game as Chernogorsk. Even from such distance, you can recognize typical blocks of flats in Chapaevsk, Novoselky and Dubky, where you surely more than once encountered camping snipers. The real Chernarus does not have a sea, because we don’t have any in the Czech Republic, but you can recognize the shore as the curve of the river Labe. I have snapped a couple of photos for you to compare the “real Chernarus” and it's game counterpart as shown in update 0.62.  Comparison of Ústi nad Labem and Chernogorsk: http://i.imgur.com/ye1qJAr.jpg http://i.imgur.com/IoRhpoD.jpg Later on, we moved to Lipová, which was the original village you know as Starý Sobor. It has the characteristic red barn and two large abandoned cowsheds. I looked behind the buildings, where the military tents are supposed to be, but of course they were not there. There is an area with concrete floor instead, where silage used to be fermented. http://i.imgur.com/kdAMRFc.jpg http://i.imgur.com/CGVj7cF.jpg Abadoned cowsheds: http://i.imgur.com/54eEXpn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/kf4gD4X.jpg After Lipová, we travelled to village Javory, which can remind you of ingame Gorka. That is where the church is located, that you can see in many locations in the game. We wanted to have a look inside, but there was a sign saying “gassed, do not enter”, so we decided to not take the risk and after a bit of filming we left the town and headed for the Zub castle. http://i.imgur.com/crCEnhG.jpg http://i.imgur.com/jPeFqoN.jpg If you used to run through Moglievka to Vyshnoye in game, you might have noticed ruins of the castle Zub on your left hand side. The castle is really there, at least its remnants, and it is called Blansko. It is slightly smaller than in game, but it provides an amazing view of the surrounding countryside. You can see the small village of Vyshnoye and its vicinity. The name of the real village is the same as of the castle – Blansko. And one point of interest - a community member Ivan tweeted to us that he hid a non-public geocache with DayZ motive nearby the castle. So if you will be around and manage to find it, let us know its content, because we are curious what is inside and we didn’t find it. http://i.imgur.com/iJo4y88.jpg http://i.imgur.com/js0csna.jpg It was an absolutely amazing experience for me, because I felt like I was really in the game. We did not need a map, we know Chernarus like the back of our hands, therefore we know exactly which way to choose and where everything is. If you will ever have the opportunity to visit Czech Republic, make sure not to miss this experience. I am definitely planning to go back to real Chernarus, this time on foot, with tent and some beans for couple of days, because it is worth it, will you join me? I hope you enjoyed my short report and I can not wait to show you the video we filmed there. If you were also on a trip through the real Chernarus, do not hesitate to show off and tweet to us what you liked the most and some of your pictures! Have a great time and see you in Chernarus, this time in game! Header image: Mark_Knophler - Baty / Community Manager ",

Additionally, everything is real time, which (coupled with independence from addons) cuts down the time required for setup dramatically. http://i.imgur.com/yqOrXuV.jpg After introduction of this new system, we managed to get from more than 1.000.000 spawn points (mind that was after massive reduction for 0.61 version from 4.000.000+ spawn points) to current ~130.000 used, and at the end, what matters the most is the increased server performance. Don't waste time doing unnecessary things... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer Dev Update/Mark Hi everyone, Mark Gill here! I'm one of the map designers who has done many tasks for Chernarus, but more recently I've been focused on developing the new Chernarus forests for this 0.62 visual upgrade. This has been a lengthy, challenging, but also rewarding process. I will try to share some of the thought process behind the changes that were made. http://i.imgur.com/Niat8Be.jpg With the new forest overhaul, we hope the survivor experience in DayZ will be greatly enhanced. We tried to make traveling through forests a more immersive experiance. Repetition can quickly become boring on a map of our scale, so as you traverse through forests across the map, the visuals will change at a fairly rapid pace. This was a large undertaking, but it was important to keep the visual stimuli changing in unpredictable ways. http://i.imgur.com/D693piO.jpg We were able to increase the number of tree variations thanks to our talented artists to create types of forest that display different characteristics. The overall shape, size, and canopy development gives sections of forest a sense of age. These sections can vary from close spacing of younger variants. to farther spacing of older variants. There are limits to density due to the performance impact, but hopefully the amount of variables at play will keep you on your toes as you travel across the map. http://i.imgur.com/KXZNUD6.jpg Broadleaf hedgerows and forest edges now have a lower profile than in the past. This looks more natural and adds more coverage at a lower height. With this change, sections of forest are more self-contained with this \"bushier\" egde-line. This helps block some sight in and out of deep forest. While much thinner then reality, this balanced result is an important improvement to the visuals as well as gameplay. Moving as an individual or group in and out forest should be a more significant shift as well as hiding. While you may feel safe and hidden within deep forest sections, there is also the opposite of not knowing who may be nearby. http://i.imgur.com/gefYWfW.jpg http://i.imgur.com/PhrVstf.jpg We hope you will enjoy your freshly upgraded playground! - Mark Gill/ Map Designer  Dev Update/Adam Hello everyone, I hope that you enjoyed this SR's contribution from Mark, our map designer, who has showed a great passion for such whopping task as transforming the nature of Chernarus is. He spend countless amount of time designing and configuring how the new forests and individual vegetation looks and we are all excited for the day when you finally be able to experience new Chernarus too. We are currently really busy with map tweaking to make sure we can deliver the new Chernarus in best possible shape we can in given time. Please keep in mind that update .62 has touched almost every corner of Chernarus and while we do our best to make sure everything will look just like we wanted, there will be some minor map-related issues. Also, keep in mind that update .62 contains initial changes to the whole western border, completely getting rid of old terrain and object layout and replacing it with much more detailed landscape and layout. This work, labelled as western expansion, is however split into several phases and more additions and fixes are planned for later updates. http://i.imgur.com/sCCqUv0.jpg In addition to many great improvements to the way grass, trees look and behave in wind, our programmers also went and fixed many issues related to lighting and sky. One of the major things was that before 062, shadows were turned off too early / too late and that impacted the quality of scene (mainly interiors) in a very bad way. This issue was fixed along with many more (like smoother sky-fog transition, reduced size of the moon and sun, moon visibility, horizon look, and more...). These changes have enabled us to focus on lighting config for Chernarus, which saw some great changes. While we do not consider it to be final, we hope that it will prove to be a very fitting addition to the visual update coming with 0.62. http://i.imgur.com/Z2DSdBG.jpg Additionally, in January 24th SR I promised you that I will show you the new railway stone bridge, so here it is! Coming in 0.62 along with many additional changes to the railway network of Chernarus! http://i.imgur.com/Xu1ApDz.jpg See you in Chernarus! - Adam Franců / Senior Map Designer  Community Spotlight Last week, together with our Brand Manager Martin and our external camera crew, we embarked to the real world model for Chernarus to shoot a new Q&A video with our Map Designer Adam Franců a.k.a Sumrak (a well known Arma 3 modder). The real Chernarus is found in the vicinity of the town of Ústi nad Labem in the Czech Republic and we already talked about it in the March Status Report. As a first thing we aimed for the \"Pik Kozlova\" (or Kozí vrch in the real world), which offers beautiful view of the outskirts of Ústi nad Labem that you most likely know from the game as Chernogorsk. Even from such distance, you can recognize typical blocks of flats in Chapaevsk, Novoselky and Dubky, where you surely more than once encountered camping snipers. The real Chernarus does not have a sea, because we don’t have any in the Czech Republic, but you can recognize the shore as the curve of the river Labe. I have snapped a couple of photos for you to compare the “real Chernarus” and it's game counterpart as shown in update 0.62.  Comparison of Ústi nad Labem and Chernogorsk: http://i.imgur.com/ye1qJAr.jpg http://i.imgur.com/IoRhpoD.jpg Later on, we moved to Lipová, which was the original village you know as Starý Sobor. It has the characteristic red barn and two large abandoned cowsheds. I looked behind the buildings, where the military tents are supposed to be, but of course they were not there. There is an area with concrete floor instead, where silage used to be fermented. http://i.imgur.com/kdAMRFc.jpg http://i.imgur.com/CGVj7cF.jpg Abadoned cowsheds: http://i.imgur.com/54eEXpn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/kf4gD4X.jpg After Lipová, we travelled to village Javory, which can remind you of ingame Gorka. That is where the church is located, that you can see in many locations in the game. We wanted to have a look inside, but there was a sign saying “gassed, do not enter”, so we decided to not take the risk and after a bit of filming we left the town and headed for the Zub castle. http://i.imgur.com/crCEnhG.jpg http://i.imgur.com/jPeFqoN.jpg If you used to run through Moglievka to Vyshnoye in game, you might have noticed ruins of the castle Zub on your left hand side. The castle is really there, at least its remnants, and it is called Blansko. It is slightly smaller than in game, but it provides an amazing view of the surrounding countryside. You can see the small village of Vyshnoye and its vicinity. The name of the real village is the same as of the castle – Blansko. And one point of interest - a community member Ivan tweeted to us that he hid a non-public geocache with DayZ motive nearby the castle. So if you will be around and manage to find it, let us know its content, because we are curious what is inside and we didn’t find it. http://i.imgur.com/iJo4y88.jpg http://i.imgur.com/js0csna.jpg It was an absolutely amazing experience for me, because I felt like I was really in the game. We did not need a map, we know Chernarus like the back of our hands, therefore we know exactly which way to choose and where everything is. If you will ever have the opportunity to visit Czech Republic, make sure not to miss this experience. I am definitely planning to go back to real Chernarus, this time on foot, with tent and some beans for couple of days, because it is worth it, will you join me? I hope you enjoyed my short report and I can not wait to show you the video we filmed there. If you were also on a trip through the real Chernarus, do not hesitate to show off and tweet to us what you liked the most and some of your pictures! Have a great time and see you in Chernarus, this time in game! Header image: Mark_Knophler - Baty / Community Manager ",

Another beefy Status Report this week! Brian talks about basic vehicle goals for BETA, Eugen shares a story about one of our development decisions, and Peter and Mirek go more in depth about some of their recent work! Let's get to it.  Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, As Eugen is covering what the current tasks are, that frees me up to talk about some of the mechanics and systems that we (Peter, myself, the development team as a whole) are looking forward to improving upon in beta and the milestones past that. Given that after checking the various communities centered around DayZ, I noticed a group of posts doing their best impression of the World War 3 style courtroom audience summoned by the Q entity in Star Trek's Encounter at Farpoint when discussing the current state of vehicles, I figured now is as good a time as any to clear up some things when it comes to them, in DayZ. (The vehicles, not Q's apparitions) ]While I personally love the work Peter and the design team did on manual transmissions in DayZ, vehicle handling and mechanics as a whole are far from where we want them to be. The biggest culprit of this, obviously, is physics, and their handling on terrain. We did show some of the changes being worked on for that area of the vehicles, but many may have missed it. https://media.giphy.com/media/LpIuoDNMyNSbC/giphy.gif It's fair to say that vehicles in DayZ's Alpha phase of Early Access have received the least amount of user visible love. Part of that is due to the complex physics situation in DayZ, as we still currently operate two completely separate physics systems. Another part of that is due to so much of the focus being on technology, and getting it in place to support DayZ as we want it to be. I'm looking forward to that, as from my perspective, vehicles are a critical component of mid-to-late game DayZ gameplay - and quite honestly, without them in a satisfying state, you tend to just end up with a walking simulator ;) Let me give you guys a look at some of the areas we will be looking at improving into and throughout Beta. Terrain handling / acceleration SFX (Engines / Transmission) UI (Specifically in the toggle-able HUD that we have shown before - so that 3PP players can see the same critical info 1PP can) Feedback on vehicle damage state (Aside from damage materials, and doors falling off - think smoke from a damaged engine, engine stumble/diesel when running out of fuel) Proper destruction of vehicle when it has been destroyed (rather than the current state of the vehicle just not turning on) Don't think for a moment anyone on the dev team looks at vehicles the way they are now and says ]\"Y'know what - that's perfect, ship it\" - far from it. All of us are just as antsy and eager to see DayZ's systems start to flesh out and polish as we all want them to be - we just have to knuckle down and understand that the technology to support our vision needs to be ready for us to start implementing this. This exact reason, and so much more is why all of us are so focused on, and excited to enter the BETA phase of DayZ's Early Access. I'll leave you all with that, as I'd like to put together Peter and I's thoughts on stamina, and weapon sway for the next Status Report. For now, just promise not to kill me on sight when you see me in Severograd. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hey guys, as some of you have noticed, I have omitted listing audio changes as part of 0.62 update in the last Status Report. That was an honest mistake, but it also highlights what a dynamic place game development is. I`ll try and have my contribution structured as a goal for the future Status Updates. Usually, I'll begin with a \"story from development\", just so you can see what kind of decision making is happening everyday, as well as going through the things we have been working on in the respective departments for each patch separately. 0.62 Strike Team Update & Development Story This time, it’s a story AND a progress update - yay! 0.62 patch was originally planned for delivery (on Experimental branch)during the second week of April, but due to complications and cooperation on engine milestones, it became apparent that we needed to close them sequentially, rather than working on both at once. Remember that only small team is working on 0.62 at the moment, as almost all of us are focusing on BETA/0.63 delivery. However, back to the topic at hand. Originally, that shouldn't have been that much of a problem. As we started testing the 0.62 update, we quickly found out that when we enable the new positional environmental sounds (basically the reworked Arma 3 tech introduced with the Eden Update that is becoming a part of Enfusion Engine platform), we encountered a crash. The crash itself manifests when you switch window focus fast enough during startup, but it can manifest at any point, this is just the easiest way to get it. The crash is based around file system and resource management of our engine - one of the last remaining parts that are not rewritten for DayZ yet. We have a couple of options now: We can either rework the content to work with the old system to make the new sounds function, but lose the ability for positional audio in environments, or fix the bug in the resource management and make the old system work with the new content and data. We can also rewrite the system completely to get the pattern of these crashes fixed on the platform as a whole. It might look like a small thing, but the positional environment audio makes the game much more immersive. And the issues go much deeper than that, as the same system might be causing some console performance issues (and more). To get an overview and make a right decision requires fast, but actionable intel. These things happen often when working with older technology, especially when you are in a process of refactoring it as well. This resource management has been the culprit of many issues in the past, but so far it held the test of time. That might not be the case going forward, and might need some serious looking into. http://i.imgur.com/iq8B98d.jpg  0.63 BETA Strike Team Update As for the work with BETA Strike Team, I list them below. One line of text / bullet point usually means it's in the hands of a single person working on the feature and handling the ownership. However, be aware that I need to simplify it to make things at least a little bit digestible, so it's hard to strike the right amount of detail without basically reworking JIRA tasks to show them here: Programmers • AI script implementation • Zombie behavior script representation • Wind rework and debugs • Inventory and item conditions • Item spawn definition • User actions in multiplayer • Exhausted and hurt player animation support • Network traffic optimization • New version check (to prevent edge cases of connecting to a different build of a game) • Lightning fixes (new lightning setup) • Sound event manager • Tons of crash fixing • Tons of bug fixes Animators • Weapon mechanics animations polishing (unjamming, reloads) • Inverse Kinematics poses • Mocap (Player turns and more) • Hit reactions on player • Animation plugins • Cow and Bull refactor for the new animation system Designers • User actions in multiplayer • Player representation • New item hierarchy definition • New player and item spawn definition • Inventory UI refactor • Lifespan • Tree fire geometry • Tons of bug fixes Audio • Positional environment audio QA • Playtest 0.62 • Door rework priority assignment (standardized door sizes) • Performance profiling in 0.62 • Client performance benchmarks in 0.62 http://i.imgur.com/WePCbGp.jpg I know that a list is not the best way to present the progress, but might be interesting for the development folks out there. However, I would also like to make it much more representative. There are tons of things happening at the same time, and we are in process of visualizing the sprint in very near future and I`ll try and share our overview of BETA progress when things settle down. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Dev Update/Peter Along with upcoming changes to doors behavior I wrote about in the past, another issue which we definitely need to address and solve is the wide variety of different widths and heights of door openings. It may sound like a marginal issue, but I encourage you to continue reading, and discover how it affects gameplay. Nearly every opening in DayZ is unique, which is caused by historical reasons and non-existing metrics back then (we are using a mixture of different structures collected from Operation Flashpoint, Arma 1, Arma 2, and some new ones made exclusively for DayZ). Apart from the fact that doors with dimensions below ideal standard just look bad and out of place (not to mention handles placed in above knees height) and feel odd (especially from the first person camera), they are also hindering the \"fluency\" of player movement. Character collisions coupled with old clunky locomotion are introducing unwanted challenge in such simple action as going through the door, turning doors into an obstacle. Internal tests made with both old and new characters show us that a minimum clear opening of doors in DayZ should have clear width of 120cm and clear height of 220cm, and these dimensions were established as required metrics. http://i.imgur.com/DvKzbXw.png Everything below causes issues with character navigation, and feels odd especially in first person camera, where opening seems very narrow and low due to camera FOV and perspective. Also the third person camera then shows unnecessary jumping down while going through the door (if their opening height is under 220cm). New doors metrics with their new behavior will add a lot to responsiveness and smooth movement through the environment and its obstacles. As we are continuing to work on 0.63 version AKA BETA, programmers are getting rid of old systems down the road. Lastly, old player has been completely removed internally, and with it also firearms handling (that includes firearms action like chambering, reloading, shooting… etc.) and aiming model (which means sway, recoil, dexterity, aiming, holding breath…), together with melee fighting (traced swings…) are gone forever as these were integral parts of the old player. This untied our hands as now is the time when prototypes based on design I mentioned in past Status Reports (8 March 2017 and 28 September 2016) start being implemented in close cooperation between programmers, animators and us managing the design and script side of things. Rewrite of firearms also allows us to introduce mechanics like changeable gun barrels (we have 2 more barrels for AUG ready to experiment with), different muzzle speeds for the same ammunition type depending on barrel length (which helps balancing firearms between each other, or vice versa), different muzzle speeds for different ammunition type used in same firearm (pellets vs slugs anyone?), switching between scope and sights if possible (like AK family, AUG…) and refinement of, and more importantly, connecting already introduced firearms mechanics like unjamming, mechanism manipulation, chambering and others to the new animation system . I just can't wait for the moment these systems will be fully re-implemented, as it will change the combat experience a lot in general. - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek We have finished network part of user action system as I described in my last Status Report contribution. It's worth to mention that this change has decreased network traffic from clients significantly and now our client on 0.63 sends (with some small exceptions) only input packets. This change will help a lot to resolve issues like late hits registration and it also should help to overall game responsibility. Weapon system has received some new features, like changeable barrels and muzzles and support for attached grenade launchers. Basic implementation for weapon jamming is ready since last week. And another small new feature - we're working on a system that will select communication channel for chat and voice automatically, so players won't have to change channel using keyboard cursor keys. Apart from that, most of our time is still being spend on the new player implementation - tweaking movement and collisions, creating new weapon aiming system and connecting it all to other gameplay systems - we'll talk about these later on, when they are ready. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Community Spotlight Greetings Survivors, It is getting warmer outside in Europe, but not even the nice weather can stop you from playing your favorite game. With every day, we are getting closer to release of the 0.62 Update and the community is trembling with impatience and nervousness. But don’t worry, I am also looking forward to the release of the new update, same as you. As you surely know from previous Status Reports, update 0.62 will also contain map updates, which are being taken care of by our map designer Adam Franců a.k.a. Sumrak. We will be shooting new Q&A video with him in the next couple of days. If you have any questions regarding his work and the DayZ map, feel free to ask him . And now for the things that landed on our Twitter, official forum or Reddit over the last two weeks.  When I opened Twitter today, the first thing that caught my eye was an elaborate figurine made by Bragawn. It’s almost unbelievable that it is made entirely of paper! Great job! http://i.imgur.com/15TEWaS.jpg Next, I would like to share with you two videos that I found interesting. First one is for fans of role-play gameplay style. It is a ritual of Cult of Papa filmed by three different people and edited into one video by Ron Fox. Can you guess the place where it was filmed? Hail Papa! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOV0ItLExYA The other video is for PvP lovers. Absolutely brilliant singing opening and ending by IsSy is followed by exciting action with a lot of victims. Good aim Inherwake!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JboHRg5vCo For the end, I would like to introduce a smaller streamer from Australia who I like for his enthusiasm, optimism and being always cheerful. Make sure to check out his Twitch channel, you will surely be infected with his positivity! http://i.imgur.com/z5vEvFa.jpg  If you have any DayZ creations of your own that you'd like to share, tweet them to us on our official Twitter channel. You might just honor the next status report with your talent! Awesome header image submitted by: Damigo - Baty / Community Manager ",

It may sound like a marginal issue, but I encourage you to continue reading, and discover how it affects gameplay. Nearly every opening in DayZ is unique, which is caused by historical reasons and non-existing metrics back then (we are using a mixture of different structures collected from Operation Flashpoint, Arma 1, Arma 2, and some new ones made exclusively for DayZ). Apart from the fact that doors with dimensions below ideal standard just look bad and out of place (not to mention handles placed in above knees height) and feel odd (especially from the first person camera), they are also hindering the \"fluency\" of player movement. Character collisions coupled with old clunky locomotion are introducing unwanted challenge in such simple action as going through the door, turning doors into an obstacle. Internal tests made with both old and new characters show us that a minimum clear opening of doors in DayZ should have clear width of 120cm and clear height of 220cm, and these dimensions were established as required metrics. http://i.imgur.com/DvKzbXw.png Everything below causes issues with character navigation, and feels odd especially in first person camera, where opening seems very narrow and low due to camera FOV and perspective. Also the third person camera then shows unnecessary jumping down while going through the door (if their opening height is under 220cm). New doors metrics with their new behavior will add a lot to responsiveness and smooth movement through the environment and its obstacles. As we are continuing to work on 0.63 version AKA BETA, programmers are getting rid of old systems down the road. Lastly, old player has been completely removed internally, and with it also firearms handling (that includes firearms action like chambering, reloading, shooting… etc.) and aiming model (which means sway, recoil, dexterity, aiming, holding breath…), together with melee fighting (traced swings…) are gone forever as these were integral parts of the old player. This untied our hands as now is the time when prototypes based on design I mentioned in past Status Reports (8 March 2017 and 28 September 2016) start being implemented in close cooperation between programmers, animators and us managing the design and script side of things. Rewrite of firearms also allows us to introduce mechanics like changeable gun barrels (we have 2 more barrels for AUG ready to experiment with), different muzzle speeds for the same ammunition type depending on barrel length (which helps balancing firearms between each other, or vice versa), different muzzle speeds for different ammunition type used in same firearm (pellets vs slugs anyone?), switching between scope and sights if possible (like AK family, AUG…) and refinement of, and more importantly, connecting already introduced firearms mechanics like unjamming, mechanism manipulation, chambering and others to the new animation system . I just can't wait for the moment these systems will be fully re-implemented, as it will change the combat experience a lot in general. - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek We have finished network part of user action system as I described in my last Status Report contribution. It's worth to mention that this change has decreased network traffic from clients significantly and now our client on 0.63 sends (with some small exceptions) only input packets. This change will help a lot to resolve issues like late hits registration and it also should help to overall game responsibility. Weapon system has received some new features, like changeable barrels and muzzles and support for attached grenade launchers. Basic implementation for weapon jamming is ready since last week. And another small new feature - we're working on a system that will select communication channel for chat and voice automatically, so players won't have to change channel using keyboard cursor keys. Apart from that, most of our time is still being spend on the new player implementation - tweaking movement and collisions, creating new weapon aiming system and connecting it all to other gameplay systems - we'll talk about these later on, when they are ready. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Community Spotlight Greetings Survivors, It is getting warmer outside in Europe, but not even the nice weather can stop you from playing your favorite game. With every day, we are getting closer to release of the 0.62 Update and the community is trembling with impatience and nervousness. But don’t worry, I am also looking forward to the release of the new update, same as you. As you surely know from previous Status Reports, update 0.62 will also contain map updates, which are being taken care of by our map designer Adam Franců a.k.a. Sumrak. We will be shooting new Q&A video with him in the next couple of days. If you have any questions regarding his work and the DayZ map, feel free to ask him . And now for the things that landed on our Twitter, official forum or Reddit over the last two weeks.  When I opened Twitter today, the first thing that caught my eye was an elaborate figurine made by Bragawn. It’s almost unbelievable that it is made entirely of paper! Great job! http://i.imgur.com/15TEWaS.jpg Next, I would like to share with you two videos that I found interesting. First one is for fans of role-play gameplay style. It is a ritual of Cult of Papa filmed by three different people and edited into one video by Ron Fox. Can you guess the place where it was filmed? Hail Papa! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOV0ItLExYA The other video is for PvP lovers. Absolutely brilliant singing opening and ending by IsSy is followed by exciting action with a lot of victims. Good aim Inherwake!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JboHRg5vCo For the end, I would like to introduce a smaller streamer from Australia who I like for his enthusiasm, optimism and being always cheerful. Make sure to check out his Twitch channel, you will surely be infected with his positivity! http://i.imgur.com/z5vEvFa.jpg  If you have any DayZ creations of your own that you'd like to share, tweet them to us on our official Twitter channel. You might just honor the next status report with your talent! Awesome header image submitted by: Damigo - Baty / Community Manager ",

This week, you'll hear from our Creative Director Brian Hicks and our Lead Producer Eugen Harton - as the department leads are fully focused on catching up on their tasks after a short Easter holiday, both Brian and Eugen are doing their best to report for them. Both also explain why some of the long-announced content isn''t in the game yet, and what needs to be done to have it available during BETA. Mind you, while our today's Status Report is a bit of a long read, it's also full of vital development information on the upcoming 0.62 and BETA updates, so get comfy, pour yourself a drink of your preference and reserve some time for reading - it's worth it! Also, Baty has some nice eye-candy bonus at the very end, so those who make it all the way through will surely be rewarded :) Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Eugen Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors. I watch a good deal of DayZ Twitch streams and YouTube videos in my free time - and over the last week or so, I saw something that concerned me: hearing conversation in regards to gameplay mechanics or systems currently implemented in the most basic form, and if they are intended (by developers) to ever change. Between the new user actions and rewrite to Enforce script, and the decision for designers to stop writing new systems in SQF and focus entirely on creating new gameplay systems in the new tech - it can easily seem (to those who don't closely follow development) that we just don't care about the issues currently on the Steam build, or don't ever intend to address them. That couldn't be farther from the case. For example, Peter and I have been going over functional issues with the central economy we want to see addressed for BETA and beyond - these aren't things that are being ignored. Far from it, but as always, the goal for the team is getting to the final product as quickly and efficiently as possible. While the economy functions at a playable level and much of the technology required for the final product is there, the priority for the programmers responsible for the Central Economy of DayZ moves on to the next piece of the puzzle - in this particular case, support for public access to server files and required software, modding, and off-line mode. When those critical technology tasks (that are being worked on by those specific programmers) are implemented into the internal version of the game, that's where we can shift our focus on iterating upon some of the functional issues of the Central Economy. What kind of functional issues with the economy? Well - just to list a few: Dynamic Event spawning behavior Dynamic Event item spawn quantity control Zone/Area restricted items bunching up in specific towns after extended persistence uptime Repeated spawns of the same item types in a structure Consistent availability of early game basic supplies  Also take a look at Peter's contribution to the last SR - it's a good example of how the current state of things is not final, how our features and systems will be iterated upon and improved. To be honest, there isn't much of anything in the Alpha phase of DayZ that is functionally (from a design perspective) \"complete\". Nearly every gameplay system or mechanic the player touches is at a basic functional level, meaning the tech/script/animations are present and it operates in one way or another. Fleshing it out, addressing functional and gameplay issues - that isn't something we should be wasting time and resources on, especially when so much of it is being replaced. \"What about all that cool stuff you guys have shown for years but never ended up in the game?\" You might ask - \"What happened to that?!\" - While I know both Eugen and myself have discussed this before, I can't fault anyone for missing it - it certainly is not easy trying to search or go back through Status Reports on DayZ.com at the very least. Nearly everything that has been discussed since we stopped prototyping gameplay mechanics in SQF, stopped creating animations for new items on the old animation system, and so on is, and has been worked on. I know it can seem like cool things like base building, soft skills, or player facial hair growth has disappeared because we haven't publicly associated it with a specific release. The reality of the situation is, with pretty much everything on that proverbial list being dependent upon the new player, and the focus for BETA being on getting the game stable and playable on the new engine modules - we're playing our cards close to the chest. While we may end up with a BETA candidate build that has a huge chunk of the content and gameplay systems backlog functional in it - it's just as possible that we'll end up with a smaller chunk of the backlog content and systems in that first BETA build, and the rest of the list will follow up as quick as possible (which should be at a much quicker pace, having shed a good chunk of our nasty tech debt and overhead from supporting legacy and new tech). We're in that situation because it is the technology - the foundation of everything inside DayZ that you guys experience - that is setting the pace and progress towards our goals right now. As we get closer to these core components of DayZ's underlying technology being functional and usable in a multiplayer state, we can better gauge what the gameplay and content ingredients of the BETA milestone are. I know for some of you, a good deal of this is information is something you all already know, as Eugen and I both have spoken on it several times before (and I couldn't have put it better than Eugen's contribution to the last SR), but for as many of you that may follow development closely and know all this already - there are just as many that might have missed some of this down the pipe. You know what they say: now they know... and knowing is half the battle. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Eugen Hi there survivors, since some of you appreciated my last Status Report contribution, I'm going to try and keep them as regular as possible. While knowing that my wall of text is not going to be an easy read for everyone, I do believe it's necessary to try and write stuff in technical detail in order to have an provide an honest coverage of what's happening in the DayZ Dev Team offices. There will be a lot of stuff happening over the coming months, and I want to guide you through it with as much information as possible. At this point, there are two large releases scheduled for this year. and we're fully focused on those. The development is divided into strike teams - a smaller strike team is working on the 0.62 update, which we internally like to call a \"Visual Upgrade\". It contains tweaks to lighting and new forests, as well as general world fidelity improvements (we have more to come in that department for follow-up/future updates as well). As far as what that means in a bit more detail, the Visual Upgrade coming with the 0.62 update will feature: New tree models Denser forests New clutter (grass, small plants) New surface textures (roads, plains and such) Improved wind behavior New shader for the wind, affecting trees and grass Tweaked and changed lighting for the world (for a more apocalyptic feel, yay!) Small improvements to satellite textures Rain affected by wind and refinement of its behavior in general Many reworked locations on Chernarus Reworked ghillie (to be consistent with new tech Small bugfixes to some issues from 0.61 The 0.62 update will NOT introduce: Any changes to gameplay Any changes to buildings and structures (in terms of model graphical fidelity) Any changes to player model fidelity Any changes to animation fidelity Any of the gameplay changes, or new content that we've been occasionally mentioning in Status Reports (those are all scheduled for BETA/0.63) After this milestone, the strike team for 0.62 will merge with the current 0.63 strike team, and join their efforts to reach BETA on our Steam branches as soon as possible. BETA/0.63 will be a major change for the game as a whole. That is the update that you guys have all been waiting for, and we have been working hard to reach that goal for the past few years. What does that mean in more concrete terms though? All the new engine technology we have developed for DayZ, along with the content of the current game - all merged in and improved, as it has been refactored from functionality point, design-wise, and in terms of fidelity as well. Moreover, additional content and features that we couldn't properly implement on the legacy tech. Besides all the refined features, content and overall improvements to the DayZ experience, we also aim to release a handy toolset very near to (or along with) the initial BETA/0.63 update. This toolset will contain the much-requested server files. I know you are all asking: But when?!?! As much as I would love to tell you now, we want to be able to deliver a seamless core gameplay loop without bugs breaking it at first. Our main goal now is to get the melee combat and ranged combat work on the new technology, and in a real game environment, not only in a debug mode. A lot of work has been done already (like new synchronization, damage system, player representation, and more), so this means mostly adding support in synchronization, and adding content for new features in the animation system are ahead of us, but it's still a lot to handle. So just so you get the idea of what work is being done at the moment (from the perspective of disciplines): Gameplay team Refactor of hard coded world interactions to script. There were still a couple left (opening doors for example). Creation of core synchronization model for these Moving VOIP to server authoritative completely New weapons API for weapon script implementation Inventory conditions implementation for item states and more Optimizations of item spawning for server performance AI script API for behavior modification New player spawn definition New item spawn definition Vehicle behavior in new technology Backend toolset (srvlet) for central manipulation of economy, and server management (community version) Design team User actions manager for the new synchronization model Player representation refactor and debug functionality for new player (visualization and toggles for testing and manipulation) New hierarchy of item configurations (includes new technology like damage system, procedural coloring and such) Data re-structuralization to suit the new setup (file structures at the moment) Inventory refactor and optimization according to internal version Integration of soft skills to actions in game Electricity and its implementation Placing of items in world and its implementation Animation team Implementation of animation player turns Polishing new weapon animations (unjamming) Implementation of hit reactions to melee combat in the new system Work on inverse kinematics and item poses Tweaking player graph Implementation of detailed user actions animations Engine team Toolset refinement New inverse kinematics implementation New physics representation for non-player entities New shaders for trees and grass Hit reactions in animation system Synchronization of new animation system Player turns Aiming model Art team -New models (sorry, don't want to spoil stuff! https://confluence.bistudio.com/s/cs_CZ/6211/3938a2601e8fc8d1decf2078567a8651fae8f539.22/_/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png) As you can see, there is a lot of work ongoing, in order to implement all the new technology and content. Most of the tasks are now aiming to get things working together as seamlessly as possible, and a lot of them are playable in different debug environments. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer  Community Spotlight Hello Survivors, before we look at the community content for the last two weeks, I would like to tell you about a 0.61 crash we are looking for that we are not able to reproduce internally. Your game can crash when connecting to the server after waiting in a queue, and when that happens, that is what we are looking for. Should this happen to you, we would appreciate if you could send the crash dump files from folder Users\\YourPCName\\AppData\\Local\\DayZ to our Feedback Tracker. We are discussing this issue further on our official forums - come join us:  https://forums.dayz.com/topic/236621-i-am-looking-for-crash-can-you-help-me/ Overall, we welcome reports of any crashes that you will be able to reproduce - please send them together with the dump files using the Feedback Tracker. Every report will massively contribute to speeding up the fixing process of those issues.  If the wallpaper from the last Status Report was not enough for you, we have another one here, that landed on our Twitter account and that could suit your desktop well. Gaming Roach edited his screenshot into an amazing wallpaper with infected as the main theme. You can find his original screenshot here. You have some talent, man! http://i.imgur.com/eP7xhVz.jpg Today, I would like to dedicate some space to one of the role-play communities. I am a big fan of role-playing myself, and I really enjoy watching entertaining videos from post-apocalyptic Chernarus. One of them is this video from an RPevent on the whitelisted AftermathRP server that is being organized every 2-3 months. It is about the evacuation of civilians by NATO group from Staroye to Chernogorsk's docklands, while a group of Russian rebels tries to stop them. Here is a part of the official event description from their pages: \"When news first broke out about the virus, many assumed it was just the flu - horrible to have, but with treatment, something you can overcome. This was not because the survivors did not understand what the infected were, it was because of what they were told.  Information was withheld to prevent widespread panic, to make evacuations easier and more importantly, to ensure that no one knew what was happening inside of the country, should they ever get out or be able to call home. NATO started with their evacuation of civilians.  They went into towns and camps, large in numbers and ‘rounded up’ those were staying there.  If any questions were asked, NATO would simply point to one of the many flu warning posters they had put up around the country and inform people that it is a perfectly normal procedure, and they were just going to check people for symptoms, treat the ill and take the healthy to a safe location.\" If you are interested in role-play or if you want to be a participant in the next event here is more information. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwnsuGVHZA8 A friendly reminder like every week: If you want to be a part of the Community Spotlight, tweet us your content to our official Twitter account or send me a private message on our official forumprivate message on our official forum.

Your game can crash when connecting to the server after waiting in a queue, and when that happens, that is what we are looking for. Should this happen to you, we would appreciate if you could send the crash dump files from folder Users\\YourPCName\\AppData\\Local\\DayZ to our Feedback Tracker. We are discussing this issue further on our official forums - come join us:  https://forums.dayz.com/topic/236621-i-am-looking-for-crash-can-you-help-me/ Overall, we welcome reports of any crashes that you will be able to reproduce - please send them together with the dump files using the Feedback Tracker. Every report will massively contribute to speeding up the fixing process of those issues.  If the wallpaper from the last Status Report was not enough for you, we have another one here, that landed on our Twitter account and that could suit your desktop well. Gaming Roach edited his screenshot into an amazing wallpaper with infected as the main theme. You can find his original screenshot here. You have some talent, man! http://i.imgur.com/eP7xhVz.jpg Today, I would like to dedicate some space to one of the role-play communities. I am a big fan of role-playing myself, and I really enjoy watching entertaining videos from post-apocalyptic Chernarus. One of them is this video from an RPevent on the whitelisted AftermathRP server that is being organized every 2-3 months. It is about the evacuation of civilians by NATO group from Staroye to Chernogorsk's docklands, while a group of Russian rebels tries to stop them. Here is a part of the official event description from their pages: \"When news first broke out about the virus, many assumed it was just the flu - horrible to have, but with treatment, something you can overcome. This was not because the survivors did not understand what the infected were, it was because of what they were told.  Information was withheld to prevent widespread panic, to make evacuations easier and more importantly, to ensure that no one knew what was happening inside of the country, should they ever get out or be able to call home. NATO started with their evacuation of civilians.  They went into towns and camps, large in numbers and ‘rounded up’ those were staying there.  If any questions were asked, NATO would simply point to one of the many flu warning posters they had put up around the country and inform people that it is a perfectly normal procedure, and they were just going to check people for symptoms, treat the ill and take the healthy to a safe location.\" If you are interested in role-play or if you want to be a participant in the next event here is more information. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwnsuGVHZA8 A friendly reminder like every week: If you want to be a part of the Community Spotlight, tweet us your content to our official Twitter account or send me a private message on our official forumprivate message on our official forum.

This week, Viktor shares the second part of his animation Q&A video, Eugen is expanding upon his recent talk on a game dev conference here in Prague, Peter provides an example of the new car damage visualization for BETA and we've talked Adam into making some new comparison images of the new forests! Additionally, we have Mirek talking about another important milestone we';ve currently reached with our technology and Baty (among other things!) looks back at a pretty cool April Fools joke from one of our community members. Contents This Week Dev Update/Eugen Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Eugen I don't usually contribute to Status Reports, but since Brian is out of office this week, I'd like to change that and touch upon a topic of DayZ development and Early Access development in general. Brace yourselves, as this will be a bit of a long read (but there's also a video embedded below). For the start, I understand that a lot of you have concerns about DayZ development. I also do believe there have been some inherent issues with what is, and what is not viable for Early Access development phase, as this is something that was not tried a lot before, and most of it is pioneered (process-wise) as things evolve. Early Access is a dynamic environment that is quite different from the traditional closed door development. I’m gonna get quite technical, so for those who do not feel like reading a wall of text, I had a presentation at White Nights Prague conference that takes on the subject of this Status Report contribution with less detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZgMjWXuEpg That said, I do stand by the development decisions we made as a team, but also see major flaws in how one can present changes in games’ underlying technology, where most of these changes are actually the base building blocks which, in time, will be able to provide a significant change of the overall player experience. All these engine changes are, in the case of DayZ, developed with the aim to keep the game moddable at all levels, with expanded scope. The engine changes for DayZ include Renderer Networking system Controls Script Sounds Physics Tools Server-Client architecture (in most systems!) Consoles Animations All gameplay systems written inscript (to a certain degree)  We need to work on all that while we create data and iterate, while we’re slowly trickling some systems into the live game (the public Experimental/Stable branches of DayZ) to test them. That creates a certain lack of visible progress as things are in motion and need time to settle down. These days, many of the base systems are in-game internally, and we are spending a significant amount of time removing a lot of old systems, while interconnecting the new ones. Let's compare that vision we have for DayZ with the live game that’s out there right now, just so that you have an idea of what it all means in practice. Live game runs old physics system, where collisions are a giant hog on server performance. To replace that, you basically need to replace everything else, as many of these old systems were hard-coded to a large degree. You need to make an originally monolithic application into a modular one, where all these old systems are interconnected. You almost, almost start from scratch. And as small as it sounds, server performance can break anything. Most of the systems above have not been part of live game because of this dependencies in old structure. Every issue in DayZ has a reason. Most of those issues that trouble you are known to us, and have a solution somewhere in all this work that we have done, and want to bring to you. Like the stairs killing you, which is a combination of many, many factors: Issues with data binarization, physics, collisions, server-client architecture and even script and player itself. To fix a “simple” issue like that takes years of work because we really can’t take on any more technical debt and “hack” these fixes into the game to save the day. We play for the long haul, not for the short term gain. And as such, there lies the inherent issue of how to approach early access. Things take time, and you can’t buy patience with a wall of text. You just can’t. And I get that now, when we have to face the truth here, as all these things that we worked for are not in a state to make for a fun game. Yet. That point (where we will present a fun to play game) is BETA for us. Yes, we could probably, eventually set up a deployment to show each different technology change part by part (like we did with the renderer), but unless you have base the game loop present in a game,it’s just a tech demo. Even if we have all the parts ready, these details (bug fixing, connecting pieces together…) matter a lot. I’m going to use a simplified story of a decision making that happened around one simple upgrade. How player sounds should work in the future: Sound in games has a lot more to it than one would imagine at first. Besides the sound data itself (which has to be prepared in context of the technology, as in supporting its data structure, and also allows further data modifications by the underlying game technology that plays the final sound for the player) there is also the important part of letting the game know when it should play a sound. Let's call that an event. You also need to edit all this in some way, to put events in gameplay that plays the sounds, and edit the sounds themselves, and don’t forget the pipeline for building the game that puts all this in some structure. Events have to be called from script, animations, items, environment... There has to be some logic to it. You need tools to visualize the data, a script to play it, have logic that decides how and why… Many of these systems were originally hard-coded - hard to tweak, hard to change. So the goal was (and is) to bring them in line with the rest of the DayZ vision, and to make the game modular, editable (visually, if possible) and expandable in the future. So we’re talking about tons of disciplines that are affected, and you can’t do one part of it and think the whole thing will still function. As you prepare the new technology to be compatible with rest of the new stuff, it is often impossible to keep things compatible. And more than often, you just need to move on and focus only on the new technology. For example with player sounds, we’re now in process of writing the sound event manager, and then we will need to connect the sounds into data structure, and define events that launch them for new animations of player moving. Meanwhile, we’re also reworking all the textures to prepare the game to recognize surfaces better, or to recognize when a sound is played in interior/exterior. At the same time, we’re implementing a way to edit the data in animation editor, in order to be able to set up these events visually, not just by playing a loop like in the old system. At the end of all this, there will be sounds playing when the foot of the player touches the ground. It might sound silly at first, but all these things and changes can expand the scope heavily for us and the modders alike. Its not going to be easy, but as I said, we're not going anywhere. - Eugen Harton / Lead Producer Dev Update/Viktor Our focus in the animation department is still mostly on melee combat and animations for new user actions. We are still iterating and adjusting animations and the game design to make the combat feel good. However, there is the second part of the animations Q&A video that got finished just minutes ago! In the first part, we were filming at our Motion Capture and studio talking about animations in DayZ in general. This time, I am trying to explain our upcoming animation system and how it helps us improve the game. You can watch both parts right here: https://youtu.be/jn5BQACzTeo https://youtu.be/68CY4gBEa2Y - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Peter After the new inventory was publicly released, we were continuously adding and implementing features to it which are directly connected to our ambitious revamp of how systems works with user actions, crafting, attachments and inventory management (you can check Status Reports from 1 March 2016 and 29 March 2016 to find out more about this effort to unify and simplify different behaviors). As we were integrating all that stuff, current inventory implementation of scripted UI got bloated and finally became unsustainable. Currently, it's being rewritten from scratch, which may seems scary at first, but it's the right step for a better, cleaner, more functional and most importantly faster inventory UI. System of gestures was implemented in Enforce script and it's not a hard-coded part of the engine anymore, which offers more possibilities. Powered by the new animation system, it brings smooth controls and seamless transitions from ending part of gesture animations directly to character movement. As over time number of gestures exceeds available function keys, we started the work on a new radial menu UI for gestures picking (binding gestures to function keys is still possible though). With upcoming changes to vehicle physics and simulations, we are also enhancing visuals for different damage states of vehicles, as well as how to make new abandoned and wrecked ones from all these driveable models we already have. Large attachments like doors, hoods and wheels will be removable from these abandoned and wrecked vehicles, which can be combined with different color and damage states. The fact I like the most is the possibility to interchange all of these per attachment, or on different parts of body, depending on the direction of impact. http://i.imgur.com/4mmAbeQ.jpg For more variation... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek Last week, another major milestone has been met - we've moved animals and infected to the new animation system, which means the internal build of the game is only using one animation system now. This is great, because we can now focus only on one type of implementation, and can remove a lot of the legacy code, which will make our lives a lot easier. Now we just need to connect existing game features to the new implementations of player and AI entities, and solve issues like AI pushing players etc. Interaction system with game environment is heavily modified, too. In current 0.61 (and future 0.62) updates, the client side is asking the server side for possible interactions and the server returns a list of these actions. In 0.63, we've decided to get an action list on the client side, so there won't be any latency lag and there will be less network traffic between the client and server. Also, there is going to be a client side prediction for each performed action, which means that you will see direct response when you press interaction button and server will be able to interrupt these actions in case of faulty prediction (e.g. two players are picking up some item at the same time) or in case of cheating. Another major change in our internal version was the Voice over Network communication. It's now using client/server architecture as well. This allowed us to optimize voice data traffic, and more importantly, there will no longer be any peer to peer connections between players. Together with these changes, our scripters should be able to begin with the Enforce Script implementation of new advanced communication features (like public address system or static transmitters). - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Adam We've made serious progress on an important milestone task for the release of the 0.62 update - color tweaks for all the new vegetation assets. This task is focused on making sure that all new assets blend together and look just right. In addition to that, we are also utilizing colorization feature that brings much needed local color variety between individual assets. Please consider content of all pictures in this status report as work in progress. They do not represent final state yet as we are still working on additional color tweaks and other things such as configuration of clutter (grass) and surface mask. Following two pictures show how the color tweaks affected the overall feel of the new Chernarus. In first picture, you also have the option to compare it with current (0.61) version of Chernarus: Before: http://i.imgur.com/MOcDZJF.jpg After http://i.imgur.com/4OcqY5T.jpg http://i.imgur.com/SEsxUo8.jpg We've also added younger conifer forests to the layout of the new Chernarus forests. In our previous iterations, only older conifer forests were used for all conifer generation shapes. We have prepared a layout and included these younger parts everywhere we thought they would fit. That not only includes denser spruce, larch and pine forest parts, but also clearings with really young trees. This change should give you an idea that many of the conifer forests on Chernarus were actively harvested for wood, and thus many resemble un-natural shapes. Following pictures provides an example of young conifer forest parts near Devils Castle (which is one of the more harvested areas on new Chernarus). Again, you have the option to compare following pictures with current (0.61) version of Chernarus. Before: http://i.imgur.com/t7UbrxU.jpg After http://i.imgur.com/SLkOnDD.jpg You may remember that I mentioned a western expansion in earlier status reports. This task is still very much active and just last week, we have replaced all prototype forest on the western part by the generation output. This basically means that the western border now has properly generated forests, same like pretty much the rest of the new Chernarus. With this, I can happily say that you will be able to enjoy the whole new look of the whole western part of Chernarus in 0.62 update (time to say good bye to the empty lands with few trees!). That being said, this is just the first iteration, expect many changes with future updates. This picture is meant as a small teaseer of what you can expect on the western border. Direct comparison to the old Chernarus does not make sense in this case, as the terrain is now vastly different: http://i.imgur.com/OxykWQX.jpg - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Dev Update/Community Spotlight Server Pipsi is preparing an interesting PVP event themed “Australia vs. New Zealand”. Player slots are filling up quickly, but New Zealand still has couple of available ones, so if you are from Dean Hall’s home country, be sure to sign up! http://i.imgur.com/HsR1xZZ.jpg  This amazing teddy bear from streamers and big DayZ fans Queennie and MrBlue, who've been supporting DayZ for several years, arrived to our office. Many thanks for the beautiful and kind letter that warmed our hearts. http://i.imgur.com/h8vDdFg.jpg http://i.imgur.com/fzfbGnV.jpg  When we are on the topic of gifts, DukeTales was showing off a birthday gift from his girlfriend on Reddit. The clock is hand-made and its face is decorated with cans you can recognize from the game. Happy birthday DukeTales! http://i.imgur.com/TyTHq6A.jpg  Next, we would like to show you the absolutely brilliant artwork with DayZ theme by IqfishLP, which he published on Reddit. He even recorded the process of creating it. He managed to transform a common screenshot into this artwork worthy of being your new wallpaper. Great job! http://i.imgur.com/DjVg6mJ.jpg https://youtu.be/neUmWmmcEro  To finish things off, let’s go back to one April Fools’ Day joke which spread through the community a couple of years ago and was initiated by Duro Bulo. I was not yet part of the DayZ team back then and I did fall for it. Duro Bulo started a hoax about a possible malaria infection being carried by the vicious mosquitos of Chernarus. He even made up a way to protect yourself from this dangerous insect – a bug repellent spray. Duro certainly does not lack creativity. But don’t forget, it is only a joke! http://i.imgur.com/9wXQU6k.jpg http://i.imgur.com/8kKt3kN.jpg Tweet us if you encountered any DayZ April Fools’ joke this year. Did you get fooled? If you have any community content or event which you would like to share with us, the easiest way is to tweet to our official Twitter. Header image by: THE MR POTATO - Baty / Community Manager ",

This allowed us to optimize voice data traffic, and more importantly, there will no longer be any peer to peer connections between players. Together with these changes, our scripters should be able to begin with the Enforce Script implementation of new advanced communication features (like public address system or static transmitters). - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Adam We've made serious progress on an important milestone task for the release of the 0.62 update - color tweaks for all the new vegetation assets. This task is focused on making sure that all new assets blend together and look just right. In addition to that, we are also utilizing colorization feature that brings much needed local color variety between individual assets. Please consider content of all pictures in this status report as work in progress. They do not represent final state yet as we are still working on additional color tweaks and other things such as configuration of clutter (grass) and surface mask. Following two pictures show how the color tweaks affected the overall feel of the new Chernarus. In first picture, you also have the option to compare it with current (0.61) version of Chernarus: Before: http://i.imgur.com/MOcDZJF.jpg After http://i.imgur.com/4OcqY5T.jpg http://i.imgur.com/SEsxUo8.jpg We've also added younger conifer forests to the layout of the new Chernarus forests. In our previous iterations, only older conifer forests were used for all conifer generation shapes. We have prepared a layout and included these younger parts everywhere we thought they would fit. That not only includes denser spruce, larch and pine forest parts, but also clearings with really young trees. This change should give you an idea that many of the conifer forests on Chernarus were actively harvested for wood, and thus many resemble un-natural shapes. Following pictures provides an example of young conifer forest parts near Devils Castle (which is one of the more harvested areas on new Chernarus). Again, you have the option to compare following pictures with current (0.61) version of Chernarus. Before: http://i.imgur.com/t7UbrxU.jpg After http://i.imgur.com/SLkOnDD.jpg You may remember that I mentioned a western expansion in earlier status reports. This task is still very much active and just last week, we have replaced all prototype forest on the western part by the generation output. This basically means that the western border now has properly generated forests, same like pretty much the rest of the new Chernarus. With this, I can happily say that you will be able to enjoy the whole new look of the whole western part of Chernarus in 0.62 update (time to say good bye to the empty lands with few trees!). That being said, this is just the first iteration, expect many changes with future updates. This picture is meant as a small teaseer of what you can expect on the western border. Direct comparison to the old Chernarus does not make sense in this case, as the terrain is now vastly different: http://i.imgur.com/OxykWQX.jpg - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Dev Update/Community Spotlight Server Pipsi is preparing an interesting PVP event themed “Australia vs. New Zealand”. Player slots are filling up quickly, but New Zealand still has couple of available ones, so if you are from Dean Hall’s home country, be sure to sign up! http://i.imgur.com/HsR1xZZ.jpg  This amazing teddy bear from streamers and big DayZ fans Queennie and MrBlue, who've been supporting DayZ for several years, arrived to our office. Many thanks for the beautiful and kind letter that warmed our hearts. http://i.imgur.com/h8vDdFg.jpg http://i.imgur.com/fzfbGnV.jpg  When we are on the topic of gifts, DukeTales was showing off a birthday gift from his girlfriend on Reddit. The clock is hand-made and its face is decorated with cans you can recognize from the game. Happy birthday DukeTales! http://i.imgur.com/TyTHq6A.jpg  Next, we would like to show you the absolutely brilliant artwork with DayZ theme by IqfishLP, which he published on Reddit. He even recorded the process of creating it. He managed to transform a common screenshot into this artwork worthy of being your new wallpaper. Great job! http://i.imgur.com/DjVg6mJ.jpg https://youtu.be/neUmWmmcEro  To finish things off, let’s go back to one April Fools’ Day joke which spread through the community a couple of years ago and was initiated by Duro Bulo. I was not yet part of the DayZ team back then and I did fall for it. Duro Bulo started a hoax about a possible malaria infection being carried by the vicious mosquitos of Chernarus. He even made up a way to protect yourself from this dangerous insect – a bug repellent spray. Duro certainly does not lack creativity. But don’t forget, it is only a joke! http://i.imgur.com/9wXQU6k.jpg http://i.imgur.com/8kKt3kN.jpg Tweet us if you encountered any DayZ April Fools’ joke this year. Did you get fooled? If you have any community content or event which you would like to share with us, the easiest way is to tweet to our official Twitter. Header image by: THE MR POTATO - Baty / Community Manager ",

At this point, we have implemented animations for unarmed combat, axe, pipe and knife combat. These animations are still work-in-progress but allow us to test basic behavior in-game. This is very useful: we can now iterate with programmers and designers and adjust every animation accordingly so that it blends better, for instance if you perform continuous attacks. Our plan is to have unique attack animations for fist fight, axe, knife and items like fire extinguisher, pith fork, baseball bat, pipe and many other items in order to achieve a unique look and feel when fighting. Creating attack animations for this new system is bit more time consuming though. In the old combat, there was one attack animation per item. In the new melee combat, we now have a series of 6 animations per item. These animations blend together, so you can either perform attack and go to idle or you can continue with another attack without interruption. https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcjaFZxUyzlAg1O/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohze3gxNvYt1btiAo/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcu11Se6tNxTVaU/giphy.gif In upcoming weeks, we are planning to add damage to the player and hit reactions, as well as continue on balancing the entire melee combat system. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Andrej Ahoy survivors! The audio department is operating at full power, working on both 0.62 and 0.63 updates. For 0.62, we are preparing a full revamp of ambient sounds. New atmospheres andenvironment sounds in general, but also spatial vegetation or structure sounds. We are utilizing the potential of our new sound system, so it's not just new samples, but a true, complete overhaul: new ambient sounds for forests, coast side, fields but also cities and villages are all in the making. The infamous, annoying random sounds of fence screeching are gone, and audio will also follow weather dynamically and in more detail, ultimately meaning new wind, thunder and rain sound effects will be added to DayZ. In general, roaming the countryside of Chernarus will be a much more pleasant experience to your ears. At the same time, part of our audio team is working on the 0.63 update, where we will introduce new user actions sounds, weapon reload sounds and basically all audio connected to the player character. 0.63 will also bring new vehicle sounds through our redesigned audio system, so driving will sound more natural and responsive to engine behavior. That's all from audio department now, we will share some more before the update drops!  - Andrej Sinkevic / Lead Sound Designer  DayZ Forums News During the past week, the DayZ forums have gone under a short (but long overdue) maintenance. The new software update to the forums, deployed by our Web Team on Wednesday introduced some neat improvements to the design template, but more importantly, it significantly increased the loading times of the forums and their overall security. We've also re-introduced the \"give beans\" feature that all veteran forum users surely remember from past - much to everyone's delight, too, as from what we've seen, the flow of beans has been pretty steady on the forums since the update happened! We'd like to continue with general improvements to the forums, and eventually also start looking at improvements to the DayZ.com website design and usability.

        "contents": "This week, Brian and Mirek are explaining our decision to push vehicles to Stable branch early, Peter is teasing bits and pieces about our recent effort to improve the melee weapons combat, and Viktor reports on the progress his team made on animations used with that new melee combat system. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Mirek Community Spotlight  Development Board Spotlight https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/547c4a954dad7ad76b9cb6a1/58bffa7da7ea81ccdc9446b4/535a5cf4c1bd5cceb667af461f65901d/pp19_1.png  Dev Update/Brian We appreciate everyone's patience with this Status Report coming out a day later than normal as our Brand Team works on recording the next of our Dev Spotlight videos for Viktor Kostik, our Animation Lead (Baty shares more on that in the Community Spotlight). For this Status Report I'd like to lead off briefly talking about vehicles on the Steam stable branch, then take a quick look at the critical tracked issues on 0.61 and hand off to Peter, Viktor, and Mirek for the rest of this report. As many of you may have noticed, we went ahead and re-enabled the spawning of vehicles on the Stable branch servers. We've gone through a good deal of iteration on these over the last few months on experimental branch. While we've been able to tackle a great deal of the issues discovered in testing on the Exp/Unstable branch, there are still obviously critical issues with the existing implementation. Vehicles are a pillar of the DayZ experience, and one that we're far from being happy with in their current state. Their push to Stable was a measured decision based upon the limited number of active players on Experimental/Unstable branch (to be fair, the draw to participate in Exp/Unstable is obviously lower on hotfix builds compared to full updates) and the data we received through the feedback tracker, and repro steps provided. Not an easy decision to be sure, but given the option of leaving them on Exp/Unstable only and not getting the larger pool of users getting hands on with it - the call was made. Mirek will elaborate upon some of the technical points below, but I want all of you who are concerned about the operation and systems behind vehicles to rest assured. Where we are now, and where we want to be are two separate points and vehicles -will- get the attention such a core pillar of DayZ deserves. Like many things right now, all that is required is patience - as the push to Beta is a massive undertaking for us, and every in game mechanic and gameplay system is impacted by it in one way or another. As far as 0.61 work goes - we've continued to push builds through the Exp/Unstable branch over the last few weeks - and today we should be pushing another update to Stable branch from Exp/Unstable. For today's Stable update we're looking at changes that should hopefully address: Characters/Infected not dying under certain conditions (Eg: Unconscious players & headshots) Disappearing bodies of unconscious players when disconnecting In addition to these, we are still investigating several issues related to the reintroduction of vehicles onto stable branch - such as but not limited to: Server Performance Degradation (potentially related to vehicles) Reports of invisible players It's critical to understand that poor server performance can be the root cause of a significant amount of issues that you as players encounter. While this may seem concerning, as we are approaching the limit of what we can do with 0.61 and the legacy technology - the Beta milestone, and introduction of new technology on the Enfusion side opens up a lot more opportunities for us. Not to mention being able to move the server away from having to track two physics systems, which in and of itself is very resource intensive. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Peter Since new player character got on stage, we started to prototype a new melee combat with animators and programmers. Through the time, whatever we did with the melee, it still ended being just unsatisfying. In past, we bet everything on tracing actual swings and finding their collisions with geometry. While this system has its own positive aspects as it simulates real trajectories, it just doesn't behave well in such broad multiplayer environment that DayZ offers, where you need to fight server-client synchronization foremost. Even if that side of things worked flawlessly, there are other issues connected with such system. Most notably it's very difficult to predict where hit lands, or even if it reached its target, which results in uncertain behavior and ends up as frustrating for players. With all that in mind, we decided to look at it from a different perspective and build a new melee combat from scratch. Instead of simulating trajectories, we'll experiment with evaluation of successful hit, right after attack is initiated, based on variables such as distance and direction to target, speed and others. Everything in that system is reevaluated throughout the action to avoid possible misinterpretation (e.g. opponent being hit and thus receiving damage, even when he fell down from cliff before action was finished). This approach should ensure fair hit detections, and also when combined with new full body animations of melee attacks, where character is moving forward during attack, it will allow us to utilize slight rotations and drags of attacker towards his opponent, which should results in proper visual contacts of hits. What remains the same is the rule 'every item is a melee weapon' with some exceptions applied. Especially heavy items as vehicle wheels or barrels with their separate set of movement animations will be omitted from that rule for logical reasons. It's also still valid that there will be possibility for melee attacks with ranged weapons like pistol whips, buttstock hits and bayonet stabs. More attack animation with same melee weapon were added, resulting in more visual variety and combos, however we don't plan to take advantage of combos from the gameplay perspective yet. On the other side, we want to add dashed attacks from sprint. We are considering to add charged attacks and eventually a push move in case it will be doable (do not confuse with current issue of infected pushing player characters around, which is caused by interaction of two independent physics simulations), to deepen melee combat mechanics. New animation system also allow us to play proper impact animations when character being hit. New damage system has already been deployed and it's used exclusively with the new character, providing straightforward configuration and clear damage outcome from hits per weapon, properly affected by clothing. I bet new melee combat will prove to be worth the wait and it will yield satisfying results for you, players, and together with other systems which are being worked will create best possible overall experience. Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Viktor New player character is progressing well. We are now testing and iterating the new melee combat system in game. This includes cooperation between animation, design and code departments - designers are giving us their thoughts on how the combat should look like, we are adjusting attacks to that, and programmers are taking care of controls and giving us features we ask for. We are still testing on a basic set of attacks for bare hands and two handed item though, so we are still rather prototyping, but once we are satisfied with the results we will add more variations to attacks as well as unique animations for some items. Of course a lot of polishing is also expected. As the player actions are now working in a new system with new scripts, we are changing some of the old \"one time\" animations to looping ones. We have also started to work on more unique animations for interesting actions. To name few, we have recently created stitching, animal skinning, starting fire, washing hands and other animations to improve overall experience when interacting in the world. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Dev Update/Mirek Today, I won't have anything new about 0.63, we're still working on tasks which I mentioned two weeks ago, but because we enabled vehicles last week on 0.61, I would like to clarify and describe issues which they have and how we will solve them. First, I would like to describe how vehicles are different than vehicles in Arma 2 / DayZ mod. There are two major changes: 1. Physics DayZ Standalone is using Bullet Physics Engine, which allows us to create better vehicle physics behavior, but on the other hand, simulation is much more complicated. We're still working on better vehicle simulation which we would like to introduce in 0.63. But the worst issue about vehicles in 0.61 is collision detection of dynamic physical objects and terrain (you can also observe this issue when you throw some item to ground) and engine programmers are currently investigating this issue. 2. Networking DayZ Standalone is using a client-server architecture instead of peer to peer and since 0.61 there is full server authority over player/vehicle transformation, which is preventing against cheating (teleportation/flying/speedhacking). In DayZ mod, vehicle is simulated on player's client and results (position, orientation, etc.) are sent to other clients, but in standalone version, player/vehicle is simulated on both (player's client and server) and server sends results to other clients and to player's client as well for correction. When simulation result are different, player's vehicle is corrected and that is the stuttering you are observing. This can happen when some vehicle state between player's client and server is desynchronized (f.e. gearbox state) or when server performance is too low. We're looking for state desynchronization now and as I wrote in past status reports, server performance optimizations are a long term process (we already have some improvements ready for 0.62). Anyway, we will implement better smoothing algorithm, so the correction wouldn't be so aggressive. Now, you can see that vehicles in Standalone are completely different than in Arma / DayZ mod, so a lot of issues can arise. Vehicles hit experimental on December 23rd, several days after 0.61 hit stable. We thought that vehicles would be the reason to stay on experimental branch for a larger number of players, but the result was that experimental servers were almost empty. That means we didn't have enough data of how they behave on full servers or in different situations. We've fixed some issues which players had found on experimental servers (server crashes and some bad behavior of remote vehicles) and then we needed more data, so we enabled them in central loot economy (we can always disable them again without any update) and are now gathering more data to fix / improve the vehicle simulation. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Community Spotlight This status report was postponed by one day due to filming of a Q&A video with Lead Animator Viktor Kostik. We have decided to use this opportunity and record it in an environment that is very close to animations – the Bohemia Interactive motion capture studio where work was in full swing. The video is being processed right now and we cannot wait to show it to you, because we believe it is very interesting and you will enjoy it! http://i.imgur.com/XKXLYvc.jpg http://i.imgur.com/L8SQbai.jpg http://i.imgur.com/z67Xe6j.jpg  New players may be surprised to find out that Chernarus is based on a real place. It is modeled after a region in Czech Republic around the town of Usti nad Labem, bordered by the river Labe. Many hard-core fans have already traveled there. They wanted to see the real Chernarus and to browse the land they already know like their own backyard, because they spent hundreds and thousands of hours running around it. Streamer TopeRec is one of those guys. He was planning to come to Czech Republic for a long time and his dream was to see the template for Chernarus. First he went to Gorka, followed by Stary Sobor to see the famous red metal shed. And as he said for himself, he knew exactly where to go and did not even need a GPS, because the surroundings were so well known to him from the game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOYU9X5P82g If you are interested in knowing what the Chernarus landscape looks like for real, Ivan Stroganov created a map of Chernarus over the real map of Czech Republic, so you can examine everything in detail. Check it HERE. http://i.imgur.com/lWi3t4U.jpg  And if that is not enough, you can check out some pictures from bufkin, who saw real Chernarus with his own eyes. Just click HERE. https://i.imgur.com/yQtMng3.jpg  Should you have any experience with the real Chernarus, we will be glad if you share it with us on our official Twitter.

Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Mirek Community Spotlight  Development Board Spotlight https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/547c4a954dad7ad76b9cb6a1/58bffa7da7ea81ccdc9446b4/535a5cf4c1bd5cceb667af461f65901d/pp19_1.png  Dev Update/Brian We appreciate everyone's patience with this Status Report coming out a day later than normal as our Brand Team works on recording the next of our Dev Spotlight videos for Viktor Kostik, our Animation Lead (Baty shares more on that in the Community Spotlight). For this Status Report I'd like to lead off briefly talking about vehicles on the Steam stable branch, then take a quick look at the critical tracked issues on 0.61 and hand off to Peter, Viktor, and Mirek for the rest of this report. As many of you may have noticed, we went ahead and re-enabled the spawning of vehicles on the Stable branch servers. We've gone through a good deal of iteration on these over the last few months on experimental branch. While we've been able to tackle a great deal of the issues discovered in testing on the Exp/Unstable branch, there are still obviously critical issues with the existing implementation. Vehicles are a pillar of the DayZ experience, and one that we're far from being happy with in their current state. Their push to Stable was a measured decision based upon the limited number of active players on Experimental/Unstable branch (to be fair, the draw to participate in Exp/Unstable is obviously lower on hotfix builds compared to full updates) and the data we received through the feedback tracker, and repro steps provided. Not an easy decision to be sure, but given the option of leaving them on Exp/Unstable only and not getting the larger pool of users getting hands on with it - the call was made. Mirek will elaborate upon some of the technical points below, but I want all of you who are concerned about the operation and systems behind vehicles to rest assured. Where we are now, and where we want to be are two separate points and vehicles -will- get the attention such a core pillar of DayZ deserves. Like many things right now, all that is required is patience - as the push to Beta is a massive undertaking for us, and every in game mechanic and gameplay system is impacted by it in one way or another. As far as 0.61 work goes - we've continued to push builds through the Exp/Unstable branch over the last few weeks - and today we should be pushing another update to Stable branch from Exp/Unstable. For today's Stable update we're looking at changes that should hopefully address: Characters/Infected not dying under certain conditions (Eg: Unconscious players & headshots) Disappearing bodies of unconscious players when disconnecting In addition to these, we are still investigating several issues related to the reintroduction of vehicles onto stable branch - such as but not limited to: Server Performance Degradation (potentially related to vehicles) Reports of invisible players It's critical to understand that poor server performance can be the root cause of a significant amount of issues that you as players encounter. While this may seem concerning, as we are approaching the limit of what we can do with 0.61 and the legacy technology - the Beta milestone, and introduction of new technology on the Enfusion side opens up a lot more opportunities for us. Not to mention being able to move the server away from having to track two physics systems, which in and of itself is very resource intensive. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Peter Since new player character got on stage, we started to prototype a new melee combat with animators and programmers. Through the time, whatever we did with the melee, it still ended being just unsatisfying. In past, we bet everything on tracing actual swings and finding their collisions with geometry. While this system has its own positive aspects as it simulates real trajectories, it just doesn't behave well in such broad multiplayer environment that DayZ offers, where you need to fight server-client synchronization foremost. Even if that side of things worked flawlessly, there are other issues connected with such system. Most notably it's very difficult to predict where hit lands, or even if it reached its target, which results in uncertain behavior and ends up as frustrating for players. With all that in mind, we decided to look at it from a different perspective and build a new melee combat from scratch. Instead of simulating trajectories, we'll experiment with evaluation of successful hit, right after attack is initiated, based on variables such as distance and direction to target, speed and others. Everything in that system is reevaluated throughout the action to avoid possible misinterpretation (e.g. opponent being hit and thus receiving damage, even when he fell down from cliff before action was finished). This approach should ensure fair hit detections, and also when combined with new full body animations of melee attacks, where character is moving forward during attack, it will allow us to utilize slight rotations and drags of attacker towards his opponent, which should results in proper visual contacts of hits. What remains the same is the rule 'every item is a melee weapon' with some exceptions applied. Especially heavy items as vehicle wheels or barrels with their separate set of movement animations will be omitted from that rule for logical reasons. It's also still valid that there will be possibility for melee attacks with ranged weapons like pistol whips, buttstock hits and bayonet stabs. More attack animation with same melee weapon were added, resulting in more visual variety and combos, however we don't plan to take advantage of combos from the gameplay perspective yet. On the other side, we want to add dashed attacks from sprint. We are considering to add charged attacks and eventually a push move in case it will be doable (do not confuse with current issue of infected pushing player characters around, which is caused by interaction of two independent physics simulations), to deepen melee combat mechanics. New animation system also allow us to play proper impact animations when character being hit. New damage system has already been deployed and it's used exclusively with the new character, providing straightforward configuration and clear damage outcome from hits per weapon, properly affected by clothing. I bet new melee combat will prove to be worth the wait and it will yield satisfying results for you, players, and together with other systems which are being worked will create best possible overall experience.

I encourage everyone to take a look at it - as it might serve to relieve some confusion around what gets fixed, when, and so on. In addition, our Producer Eugen wrote up a forum post covering the internal milestone we recently reached towards Beta, eliminating support and dependency on the old SQF scripting language that so much of the DayZ Alpha had throughout it. This was a huge step for us internally, and something many of us have been talking about and looking forward to for years. I'll make sure to link both forum posts at the bottom of my portion of the Status Report. We're continuing to push new builds through Experimental/Unstable branch and on to Stable branch as we try and address the remaining critical issues with .61. Since the last Status Report we've been able to address several issues with memory management on the client, pushed several improvements to server performance, resolved a few known server crashes, resolved several of the performance issues tied to light sources, and we are continuing to address: Invisible Infected Additional Client Crash issues Server Memory Consumption (Which can sometimes cause issues with player stuttering, battleye time-outs, and so on) Server crashes tied to vehicles and/or AI  We're hoping to be able to show some teaser video content at PAX East over at the Astro Booth showing off some of the progress on the visual overhaul of wild Chernarus for .62, rest assured this will also be shared through our standard channels if we're able to have this available in time. As I mentioned earlier, both myself and Eugen made two forum posts that are very helpful reading to understand what our priorities are internally, as well as the impact the internal milestone of finally being able to move away from SQF has on development. Check out these posts here (you do not need to make an account to view them, don't worry :) ):  http://i.imgur.com/U9odbIq.jpg http://i.imgur.com/iWxcX6A.jpg  We know the road to the next few major builds hitting Steam might seem long, but the work going into reaching Beta is extensive - and a major change for DayZ as a whole. I know I personally (and I'm certain the whole team as well) appreciate everyone's patience, and feedback as we move towards it. I'll see you all in Chernarus - and remember, gunshots attract attention ;) - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Peter Last week we reached one of our internal milestones, specifically the removal of SQF, high level scripting language which was introduced back in days with Operation Flashpoint. When we started to work on standalone DayZ we heavily relied on SQF with its rich API of commands built over years of usage across Arma series. Original plan was to prototype and implement systems and mechanics we wanted to have in DayZ in it, then hardcode them to Real Virtuality engine directly to gain performance back. This changed once decision to build new Enfusion engine, based on previous RV and Enforce engines was made. Latter one used powerful and fast low level object oriented scripting language with its own IDE and therefore it was logical step to carry it over and improve it. Once it was production ready, we start to rewrite all gameplay and support scripts from old SQF script to newly established Enforce script, which offered us to become largely independent from programmers and to keep game open for modding. This process was quite difficult and tedious, mainly because of missing backwards compatibility, specific design and technical dependencies, limitations found down the road, and all that mixed together with our commitment to release playable version of DayZ in Early Access program. All these led us to maintain and develop basically two versions of game side by side - obsolete one for public to play in meantime and new one for us to make game as best as possible for public to enjoy later. Recently, new animation system began to be synchronized between server and client, which was long awaited impulse for us to switch exclusively to \"all new\" mindset to push things forward internally. Now every piece starts to finally fall into place, forming something I like to refer to as DayZ 2.0. The King is dead, long live The King... See you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek In the last status report, I mentioned that we started removing the legacy scripting language. We're done with it now, so Enforce Script is the only scripting language which runs on our internal version. We will continue removing other legacy systems: the next stop is the animation system. Synchronization of the new animation system is done, now we have to apply new synchronization rules to the user action system and to events performed only on server side. New player controller is now receiving support for melee combat, which will allow our animation team to tweak the combat animations in-game. Also, it's important to note that our Bratislava team is applying the new animation system to AI units. This will allow us to have much better interactions between players and infected/animals. Otherwise, we are still working on some major issues for 0.61, which we also need fixed for the 0.62 update, so every important fix is directly merged into the 0.62 internal branch, too. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Adam As many of you already heard, the upcoming 0.62 update will introduce a first set of audio-visual changes to the environment of DayZ. You may remember that we've already shared some progress on this matter last year. In this status report, I would like to touch on the subject of updating forests in Chernarus a little bit more. This is by far the biggest change Chernarus has received for the past years of its existence within Arma 2 and DayZ. This would be really tedious and unwise thing to do manually (there is a lot of forested areas), so we have internally developed a forest generation tool that will allows us to generate most of the forested areas on Chernarus. While the whole process of getting generated forests on top of anexisting map (that has all kinds of other objects already placed) requires some polishing work of course, we are very satisfied with the results so far. One of the most important things for new forests was to have enough variety. There are four key features that allowed us to have more varied forests. First, we have got roughly 6 different generation templates for each tree species (you can imagine this simply as young, mixed, older forests and so on). Achieving such variety would not be possible with the old models, so we have got at our disposal a completely new set of vegetation that contains roughly 3 times more models than the old one (and it is still growing). To give you an idea, lets take a look at the standard beech forest case (Fagus sylvatica). Following picture shows an example of available models for beech forest.  http://i.imgur.com/Fq4mM1U.jpg  This is quite a big change when compared to the old vegetation set (where we had like 3 available models for this specific species) and the picture is not even showing all models (we also do have dead tree variants). I should also mention that this is not just the case of beech trees, we do have similar-sized sets for oaks, pines, birches, larches and spruces. Just imagine combinations that can be done within just one species alone, not to mention what can we do when we combine them. We of course have some other types of species prepared too (for rarer use within forests and of course for solitary ones within fields and settlements). The third thing (that helps us achieving forest variety) is the tree colorization feature, which we already announced in one of the last years status report. This feature enables us to differentiate individual trees by changing their color ever so slightly to achieve a better autumn feel. And finally, fourth is the addition of 8 forest surface textures. This allows us to greatly increase variety on the ground level, because configuration of randomized miscellaneous objects is done per one surface texture (we can have one with more grass, one with taller ferns, etc.)  Before: http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/4458811/a43aedd91638d4fdee2225949a3d8b9993cd3278.jpg After: http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/4458811/4b38580ad4f6a1a0707a793a7a7b64ee75a725b4.jpg  Please keep in mind that what you see on this picture is still work in progress and does not represent final look, these two are here to give you an idea how the transformation from old to new forest look on a small patch of forest within Stary Sobor fields. We are well past of setting up the generation process of the whole map and tweaking the visual feel of individual forest templates (assigned to forest parts on the whole map). Our primary focus now is to make sure we won't introduce any major performance problems. There is no question about the fact that while the new vegetation models were done to be much more performance friendly, we won't just aim for the same density as the old forests were. The introduction of Enfusion renderer with .60 provides us with an opportunity to go further. We are currently working with roughly doubled object count (that equals roughly 2.6 mil of vegetation objects). Our PCs are running map benchmarks overnight (multiple times on multiple machines if necessary) to get an overview of how does the current version of Chernarus with new forests perform. We can then use this information to make additional changes to the generation (forest density). Following picture shows what kind of results we get from one type of benchmarks that we do.  http://i.imgur.com/anNRKLC.jpg  There is still lot of work ahead of us, but it is awesome to see that things are finally coming together. We cannot wait to share more info about things to come with 0.62 update (yes, there is definitely more to talk about). - Adam Franců / Lead Map designer  Community Spotlight Valentine's day is behind us and some love went to Dayz as well!

I encourage everyone to take a look at it - as it might serve to relieve some confusion around what gets fixed, when, and so on. In addition, our Producer Eugen wrote up a forum post covering the internal milestone we recently reached towards Beta, eliminating support and dependency on the old SQF scripting language that so much of the DayZ Alpha had throughout it. This was a huge step for us internally, and something many of us have been talking about and looking forward to for years. I'll make sure to link both forum posts at the bottom of my portion of the Status Report. We're continuing to push new builds through Experimental/Unstable branch and on to Stable branch as we try and address the remaining critical issues with .61. Since the last Status Report we've been able to address several issues with memory management on the client, pushed several improvements to server performance, resolved a few known server crashes, resolved several of the performance issues tied to light sources, and we are continuing to address: Invisible Infected Additional Client Crash issues Server Memory Consumption (Which can sometimes cause issues with player stuttering, battleye time-outs, and so on) Server crashes tied to vehicles and/or AI  We're hoping to be able to show some teaser video content at PAX East over at the Astro Booth showing off some of the progress on the visual overhaul of wild Chernarus for .62, rest assured this will also be shared through our standard channels if we're able to have this available in time. As I mentioned earlier, both myself and Eugen made two forum posts that are very helpful reading to understand what our priorities are internally, as well as the impact the internal milestone of finally being able to move away from SQF has on development. Check out these posts here (you do not need to make an account to view them, don't worry :) ):  http://i.imgur.com/U9odbIq.jpg http://i.imgur.com/iWxcX6A.jpg  We know the road to the next few major builds hitting Steam might seem long, but the work going into reaching Beta is extensive - and a major change for DayZ as a whole. I know I personally (and I'm certain the whole team as well) appreciate everyone's patience, and feedback as we move towards it. I'll see you all in Chernarus - and remember, gunshots attract attention ;) - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Peter Last week we reached one of our internal milestones, specifically the removal of SQF, high level scripting language which was introduced back in days with Operation Flashpoint. When we started to work on standalone DayZ we heavily relied on SQF with its rich API of commands built over years of usage across Arma series. Original plan was to prototype and implement systems and mechanics we wanted to have in DayZ in it, then hardcode them to Real Virtuality engine directly to gain performance back. This changed once decision to build new Enfusion engine, based on previous RV and Enforce engines was made. Latter one used powerful and fast low level object oriented scripting language with its own IDE and therefore it was logical step to carry it over and improve it. Once it was production ready, we start to rewrite all gameplay and support scripts from old SQF script to newly established Enforce script, which offered us to become largely independent from programmers and to keep game open for modding. This process was quite difficult and tedious, mainly because of missing backwards compatibility, specific design and technical dependencies, limitations found down the road, and all that mixed together with our commitment to release playable version of DayZ in Early Access program. All these led us to maintain and develop basically two versions of game side by side - obsolete one for public to play in meantime and new one for us to make game as best as possible for public to enjoy later. Recently, new animation system began to be synchronized between server and client, which was long awaited impulse for us to switch exclusively to \"all new\" mindset to push things forward internally. Now every piece starts to finally fall into place, forming something I like to refer to as DayZ 2.0. The King is dead, long live The King... See you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek In the last status report, I mentioned that we started removing the legacy scripting language. We're done with it now, so Enforce Script is the only scripting language which runs on our internal version. We will continue removing other legacy systems: the next stop is the animation system. Synchronization of the new animation system is done, now we have to apply new synchronization rules to the user action system and to events performed only on server side. New player controller is now receiving support for melee combat, which will allow our animation team to tweak the combat animations in-game. Also, it's important to note that our Bratislava team is applying the new animation system to AI units. This will allow us to have much better interactions between players and infected/animals. Otherwise, we are still working on some major issues for 0.61, which we also need fixed for the 0.62 update, so every important fix is directly merged into the 0.62 internal branch, too. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Adam As many of you already heard, the upcoming 0.62 update will introduce a first set of audio-visual changes to the environment of DayZ. You may remember that we've already shared some progress on this matter last year. In this status report, I would like to touch on the subject of updating forests in Chernarus a little bit more. This is by far the biggest change Chernarus has received for the past years of its existence within Arma 2 and DayZ. This would be really tedious and unwise thing to do manually (there is a lot of forested areas), so we have internally developed a forest generation tool that will allows us to generate most of the forested areas on Chernarus. While the whole process of getting generated forests on top of anexisting map (that has all kinds of other objects already placed) requires some polishing work of course, we are very satisfied with the results so far. One of the most important things for new forests was to have enough variety. There are four key features that allowed us to have more varied forests. First, we have got roughly 6 different generation templates for each tree species (you can imagine this simply as young, mixed, older forests and so on). Achieving such variety would not be possible with the old models, so we have got at our disposal a completely new set of vegetation that contains roughly 3 times more models than the old one (and it is still growing). To give you an idea, lets take a look at the standard beech forest case (Fagus sylvatica). Following picture shows an example of available models for beech forest.  http://i.imgur.com/Fq4mM1U.jpg  This is quite a big change when compared to the old vegetation set (where we had like 3 available models for this specific species) and the picture is not even showing all models (we also do have dead tree variants). I should also mention that this is not just the case of beech trees, we do have similar-sized sets for oaks, pines, birches, larches and spruces. Just imagine combinations that can be done within just one species alone, not to mention what can we do when we combine them. We of course have some other types of species prepared too (for rarer use within forests and of course for solitary ones within fields and settlements). The third thing (that helps us achieving forest variety) is the tree colorization feature, which we already announced in one of the last years status report. This feature enables us to differentiate individual trees by changing their color ever so slightly to achieve a better autumn feel. And finally, fourth is the addition of 8 forest surface textures. This allows us to greatly increase variety on the ground level, because configuration of randomized miscellaneous objects is done per one surface texture (we can have one with more grass, one with taller ferns, etc.)  Before: http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/4458811/a43aedd91638d4fdee2225949a3d8b9993cd3278.jpg After: http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/4458811/4b38580ad4f6a1a0707a793a7a7b64ee75a725b4.jpg  Please keep in mind that what you see on this picture is still work in progress and does not represent final look, these two are here to give you an idea how the transformation from old to new forest look on a small patch of forest within Stary Sobor fields.

Brian is talking about known issues and fixes what are we working now and Victor is sharing some news from animation department. We want to show you an interesting thread from our official Forum and you can find awesome song in Community Spotlight. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Viktor Handpicked: DayZ Forums News Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, This Status Report we're going to cover what the .61 Live Team are focusing on for Stable branch issues, I'll touch briefly on .62 - and then I'd like to give a little perspective on the work currently under way for the bulk of the team (Beta milestone). Rest assured, the development team is well aware of a good deal of critical issues that have popped up on various builds coming through Exp/Unstable and onto Stable branch. Some of them we're working to address in .61 updates, and some will more than likely have to wait for Beta milestone (as we're on the edge of addressing some issues in technology and systems that won't be around in Beta). The team has been able to make good strides on addressing server crash issues, but we're also tracking a good number of additional issues that have come in through the Official Feedback Tracker: Issues with the Central Economy group spawning items and clustering in some areas after extensive persistence uptime Client side FPS drops from several causes Issues tied to animation transitions at time of death Client side network freezing in some cases Remaining issues with vehicles from Exp/Unstable \"Ghost Infected\" Server Performance Issues  We're all aware that these issues are critical to everyone playing on 0.61 Stable, and we appreciate everyone’s patience and participation in utilizing the Official Forums and Feedback Tracker to better allow us to track these issues down. Hang in there and be patient, as mentioned before .61 hit Stable - a majority of the team has switched to working on Beta, and some of the issues might not make sense to spend time resolving as we're working on the .62 and Beta milestones now - but we've not given up on addressing them for .61. If you find any new issues, or have new data - please continue to utilize the Official Feedback Tracker, it might not seem like it helps but trust me - it *does*. For .62 development, we don't have too much for you in this Status Report - however Adam (Sumrak) is working on putting together some tasty information on the .62 team's progress on their end for the next Status Report. Currently the .62 team is working on profiling the Chernarus with the new trees, and making adjustments to the forests based upon the data they gather from the profiling tools. There are some additional improvements on the visual fidelity side they are looking into - but I won't ruin any of that as Adam is looking forward to what he can tell you all in the next Status Report. It (almost) goes without saying - but the Beta milestone isn't just a matter of plugging a few new things into DayZ. The Animation System ties into effectively everything you guys do in DayZ, and the New Player as well. Tie into this the goal of total removal of SQF support (The scripting language that DayZ utilizes for most every gameplay mechanic) and the teams undertaking starts to closely resemble a skeletal and critical organ transplant. A great deal of work has gone into recreating all of these SQF scripts and mechanics into the new Enforce scripting language over the last year or so, but even so - the risk and work that is required to coordinate across the team, ensure things are functioning as expected, and discovering exactly what impact the total removal of SQF has against the game is a significant amount of work. We're all excited (and a bit winded) at all of this, and understand that it may be frustrating not getting the fixes you all want for .61 Stable as fast as you'd like - but rest assured, the work that we're doing on the Beta milestone will be worth the struggle of legacy bugs on .61. Lastly, In regards to the Official Feedback Tracker - the BI Webteam has recently added support for logging in utilizing credentials from Facebook/Google accounts for those who might not want to make an additional login just to report issues. We hope this lowers the barrier for some of you that might have data on bugs you're experiencing, but have held back on reporting them.  http://i.imgur.com/5MTLaPb.jpg  I know you're all eagerly awaiting visuals and news from .62 and Beta, and no one would love to share awesome stuff with you more than those of us on the development team. We appreciate all your patience, passion, and participation in the DayZ Early Access - 2017 should be an awesome year for DayZ and the road ahead looks like a lot of fun. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Dev Update/Viktor In my short update, I would like to share some news from the animation department. We have been playing around with the player character animations a lot recently. One of the latest additions include extra transitions for player Now the character is able to move from stand or crouch run/walk/sprint to prone movement fluently. This does not limit the character in any way though, unlike in the past. If player decides during this transition he wants to stop - the character will stop nicely immediately. We have created combat animations for player and are now about to start testing them in game. We want to find nice balance between how player looks and how it plays. This is a difficult topic as our game is set in multiplayer environment, which means we are bound by some limitations that are not present in single player games. To mention other areas. Special interaction animations inside vehicles are being created now. Refining the animations is always in progress. We have revised the aimed movement for rifles, and we will focus on hand guns next. We also have received some new weapons from the Art team so we are adding animation sets to those as well. And finally, don't forget you still have some time left to ask animation related questions for our next Q&A video. Head over to the official forumsplease and ask anything you are curious about regarding DayZ animations - anything that you want me to answer. Cheers! - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Handpicked: DayZ Forums Topics We're getting back to our idea of highlighting interesting topics from the official DayZ forums this week - despite the regular, ongoing discussion we're maintaining on the topic of both Stable Branch and Experimental Branch updates, there have been additional interesting topics that you may have missed. Here's four of them, conveniently handpicked and awaiting your replies!  Q&A with Animation Lead Viktor Kostik OK, you have probably noticed this one already, but we really want everyone to be aware of it: DayZ Animation Lead Viktor Kostik is up next in our series of Developer Q&A videos and he wants to answer the animation questions you're curious about. Make sure to ask your questions under this topic, as that's where we'll be collecting them! http://i.imgur.com/EMQ6tIJ.jpg \"Who was killed by zombies in 0.61?\" by igor-vk Since 0.61 got out, we've been ensuring everyone that the infected are absolutely meant to be a serious threat in DayZ. While there is still a lot work to be done before the experience is final, the infected are already influencing the play-style of survivors in a way our design team expects - more often than not, frantically running through a city ultimately gets you killed, as witnessed by igor-vk and other survivors in a topic that beautifully describes how deadly the infected became in 0.61: http://i.imgur.com/ENuNdM2.jpg \"Items that don't spawn anymore\" by Weyland Yutani For various reasons, we sometimes prevent certain items from spawning using our Central Economy settings. If you want to check whether an item you're looking for is indeed disabled or you're just being unlucky, make sure to read the following topic - other survivors might help you out, and we'll do our best to occasionally have our Community Manager Baty join the discussion: http://i.imgur.com/xPAJckc.jpg BETA Content: PKM discussion thread To finish off our handpicked section, we've got Brian teasing yet another weapon that's waiting to be implemented into the game during BETA: the unmistakable PKM general purpose machine gun, a truly effective weapon of Russian origin, present in nearly every major armed conflict of the past 30 years: http://i.imgur.com/HtTbfAk.jpg  Community Spotlight Hey Survivors! Recently, you have been letting us know on our social networks like Forums, Twitter,Facebook, Reddit or Steam, that you are having issues with client crashes due to memory errors. Should this error happen to you, we would appreciate if you could send your crash dump files from the folder C:\\Users\\YourPCName\\AppData\\Local\\DayZ to our feedback tracker. By submitting those files, you can help us to solve the issue. Now let's move to a community content. I found a new and amazing rap music video about life in Post-Apocalyptic Chernarus with an unexpected ending. CamCANRUN proved again that he can create quality content. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=601ZTms-eGc  You know that feeling when you need to try something else. Something special. Including some new Dayz experience. That is the reason why some servers organise themed events for their players. I myself attended few \"Wild West\" events with Magnum, Repeater and cowboy hat or competition with .22 weapons only. But my most favourite are medieval fights with bows, swords and knight helmets. Astros Legacywas also attending such event on Gents Of Novo server. You can find a recording of this entertaining event on his channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEpy9Rm-EUQ If you have something you want to share with us just tweet it to our official Twitter channel.

We hope this lowers the barrier for some of you that might have data on bugs you're experiencing, but have held back on reporting them.  http://i.imgur.com/5MTLaPb.jpg  I know you're all eagerly awaiting visuals and news from .62 and Beta, and no one would love to share awesome stuff with you more than those of us on the development team. We appreciate all your patience, passion, and participation in the DayZ Early Access - 2017 should be an awesome year for DayZ and the road ahead looks like a lot of fun. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Dev Update/Viktor In my short update, I would like to share some news from the animation department. We have been playing around with the player character animations a lot recently. One of the latest additions include extra transitions for player Now the character is able to move from stand or crouch run/walk/sprint to prone movement fluently. This does not limit the character in any way though, unlike in the past. If player decides during this transition he wants to stop - the character will stop nicely immediately. We have created combat animations for player and are now about to start testing them in game. We want to find nice balance between how player looks and how it plays. This is a difficult topic as our game is set in multiplayer environment, which means we are bound by some limitations that are not present in single player games. To mention other areas. Special interaction animations inside vehicles are being created now. Refining the animations is always in progress. We have revised the aimed movement for rifles, and we will focus on hand guns next. We also have received some new weapons from the Art team so we are adding animation sets to those as well. And finally, don't forget you still have some time left to ask animation related questions for our next Q&A video. Head over to the official forumsplease and ask anything you are curious about regarding DayZ animations - anything that you want me to answer. Cheers! - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Handpicked: DayZ Forums Topics We're getting back to our idea of highlighting interesting topics from the official DayZ forums this week - despite the regular, ongoing discussion we're maintaining on the topic of both Stable Branch and Experimental Branch updates, there have been additional interesting topics that you may have missed. Here's four of them, conveniently handpicked and awaiting your replies!  Q&A with Animation Lead Viktor Kostik OK, you have probably noticed this one already, but we really want everyone to be aware of it: DayZ Animation Lead Viktor Kostik is up next in our series of Developer Q&A videos and he wants to answer the animation questions you're curious about. Make sure to ask your questions under this topic, as that's where we'll be collecting them! http://i.imgur.com/EMQ6tIJ.jpg \"Who was killed by zombies in 0.61?\" by igor-vk Since 0.61 got out, we've been ensuring everyone that the infected are absolutely meant to be a serious threat in DayZ. While there is still a lot work to be done before the experience is final, the infected are already influencing the play-style of survivors in a way our design team expects - more often than not, frantically running through a city ultimately gets you killed, as witnessed by igor-vk and other survivors in a topic that beautifully describes how deadly the infected became in 0.61: http://i.imgur.com/ENuNdM2.jpg \"Items that don't spawn anymore\" by Weyland Yutani For various reasons, we sometimes prevent certain items from spawning using our Central Economy settings. If you want to check whether an item you're looking for is indeed disabled or you're just being unlucky, make sure to read the following topic - other survivors might help you out, and we'll do our best to occasionally have our Community Manager Baty join the discussion: http://i.imgur.com/xPAJckc.jpg BETA Content: PKM discussion thread To finish off our handpicked section, we've got Brian teasing yet another weapon that's waiting to be implemented into the game during BETA: the unmistakable PKM general purpose machine gun, a truly effective weapon of Russian origin, present in nearly every major armed conflict of the past 30 years: http://i.imgur.com/HtTbfAk.jpg  Community Spotlight Hey Survivors! Recently, you have been letting us know on our social networks like Forums, Twitter,Facebook, Reddit or Steam, that you are having issues with client crashes due to memory errors. Should this error happen to you, we would appreciate if you could send your crash dump files from the folder C:\\Users\\YourPCName\\AppData\\Local\\DayZ to our feedback tracker. By submitting those files, you can help us to solve the issue. Now let's move to a community content. I found a new and amazing rap music video about life in Post-Apocalyptic Chernarus with an unexpected ending. CamCANRUN proved again that he can create quality content. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=601ZTms-eGc  You know that feeling when you need to try something else. Something special. Including some new Dayz experience. That is the reason why some servers organise themed events for their players. I myself attended few \"Wild West\" events with Magnum, Repeater and cowboy hat or competition with .22 weapons only. But my most favourite are medieval fights with bows, swords and knight helmets. Astros Legacywas also attending such event on Gents Of Novo server. You can find a recording of this entertaining event on his channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEpy9Rm-EUQ If you have something you want to share with us just tweet it to our official Twitter channel.

Additionally, Brian is talking about known issues, Adam is sharing some of his recent passion for Chernarus railways and I have the pleasure of introducing you to DannyBoyy, a truly, truly friendly survivor! Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, The last few weeks for us on the dev team have been busy. With the bulk of the team working on the Beta milestone, a smaller strike team working on 0.62, and of course ongoing efforts to address critical issues in 0.61 Stable and reintroduce vehicles to Stable branch. As soon as we have our 0.62 branch at a point we're comfortable with, we'll be sharing more example images and camera fly overs - so be on the look out for that. On the more immediate side we have a list of issues that we're fully aware of on 0.61 Stable that we're working hard to resolve. (Its important to make sure you guys know this is on our radar, so you don't think we're overlooking the issues critical to you all). Stable Issues: Known server crash methods Known duplication methods Investigation into current security exploits (Player Gear, etc) Server Performance degradation (This one impacts things such as player position sync, infected speed, and more) Server Side Economy cleanup (And potential impact on server performance)  A lot of the issues listed above are directly related to issues we've noticed reported in the forums, feedback tracker, on youtube videos, and on Twitch streams and are a priority for us to address. Given that some of them are tied to legacy systems - many of which are slated to be replaced in beta - addressing the issues can be time consuming, but rest assured we are digging into them and they are not over looked. In addition to this, there has been a good amount of discussion (and feedback tracker usage on this issue again - awesome!) in regards to the distribution in the economy, and some behaviors that don't fit with the development teams intended design. Specifically, the distribution of firearms, and their attachments across Chernarus after a decent amount of uptime on a servers local storage. The Central Economy (CE) is certainly not where we as developers want it just yet, but iteration is key with this. The designers and programmers that touch on these areas have been working on potential improvements to the economy that should help address this issue specifically - but like anything with a complex system it will require iteration over several builds to see. This isn't live on Experimental just yet - but we'll make sure to let you all know on the forums when these new changes make it that way. For those curious - the current ticket on the feedback tracker related to the CE loot spawning system can be found at: https://feedback.bistudio.com/T115748 I know this Status Report isn't chock full of fancy new screenshots or videos - but we're currently at the point in the build process where branches, and high risk commits occur. As we get further into 0.62 and Beta development and things stabilize we'll be able to share more. :) - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Peter My message will be quite short today as I just want to announce some significant changes for current 0.61 version in upcoming updates. Over the last weeks, we witnessed how the abuse of an exploit often used for duping results in server crashes in some cases, which became very common lately and essentially ruined the user experience. Because of that, we were forced to make some actions to prevent it. First one is locking the hands slot while character is performing some action - thus, you are unable to remove an item or swap it with another until the action is finished. Second one prevents initiation of user actions on items directly from inventory slots. These changes can be unpleasant as the old user action system and its quirks are now deeply rooted. However, I would like to remind you that new user actions are built on usage of hands slot exclusively, so it's not a bad idea to get used to it in advance. If you would like to read more about the upcoming new user actions, you can check my previous Status Reports from October 30, 2015, March 1, 2016 and March 29, 2016. Crashing servers is bad... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek Hello survivors, in my first Status Report this year, I would like to briefly cover current our goals for the 0.61 version and future 0.62 and 0.63 updates: 0.61 goals We (the gameplay programming team) are dealing with server performance and stability issues, and also with vehicle synchronization bugs. Hopefully most of the annoying issues will get fixed soon, so programmers working on them can join the rest of the team and they will contribute to the work on new things or 0.63 version goals. 0.62 goals As this update will be mostly visual, there won't be any major changes coming the our team. We will mostly try merging in some of the critical fixes or performance/networking improvements. 0.63 goals Currently, major part of the gameplay programming team is working on tasks related to this version. Internally, we have managed to deactivate the legacy damage system completely and now we're focused on fixing issues with our new damage system. We are also getting ready to hit the switch on all of the legacy SQF scripting, which is being replaced by Enforce Script, and we're removing some other parts of the legacy code, which is related to features we won't use anymore - such as the Arma AI, for example. About the new player controller - we are finishing network synchronization of our new animation system. The next step will be the ability to control vehicles using the new character. This will be another big change, because now you are controlling the vehicle directly and character inside vehicle is controlled by vehicle simulation. This change will simplify vehicle synchronization and can also introduce some more options for modding. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Dev Update/Adam As I mentioned in earlier Status Reports, we plan to change the entire western border of Chernarus. This is a major task and it is very likely that you will not see this upgrade fully within just one game update. In fact, if you venture towards western border on .61, you can already see results of this task - two military roadblocks with traffic jams. We are really delighted to see survivors venturing in these far locations and having interactions with other survivors and/or environment threats in these brand new places. An important part of the whole western expansion task are changes and additions to the Chernarus railway network. Railway is a very important man-made feature that always helps survivors when they get lost. The rule is simple - follow either right or left and it will eventually guide you somewhere. Now let me invite you on a small trip around Chernarus railway! Please keep in mind that all content, visible on pictures below, is work-in-progress and does not represent final quality. http://i.imgur.com/9MtngWW.jpg  The biggest change within the railway network is the addition of railway through the whole western border of Chernarus. That means you can follow railway track from Kamenka through Zelenogorsk, Myshkino, Vavilovo and finally to Novaya Petrovka. But that is definitely not all. To make sure railway network is not forming some sort of a circle (that sort of looks like a model railway), two new railway exits were added. One from Novaya Petrovka to the western border, leaving Chernarus close to where military roadblock with fuel station is located. Second railway exit starts in Svetloyarsk and goes through Turovo and Dobroe, leaving the lands of South Zagoria in northern rocky valleys. Then we have bits and pieces that were added on top of these railway network changes. The most significant are massive changes within Zelenogorsk. This town now hosts a big railway station that is split into three parts - civilian, military and industrial. Military base in Zelenogorsk went through a major face-lift and now offers more loot than ever before. http://i.imgur.com/3AA73IV.jpg http://i.imgur.com/GQmglyB.jpg  Heading further north, you may find that the huge railway and bus station in the middle of nothing near Vavilovo are missing - this is our intention as we did not really find it to be useful at that spot (and we have something better planned there). Instead, we have added a completely new railway station to Novaya Petrovka. This town is currently quite thr hot spot and with newly added railway station just north of Bashnya, it offers quite the view on the entire Novaya Petrovka valley. http://i.imgur.com/M0h6nmZ.jpg http://i.imgur.com/NQnQrkV.jpg  If you head east of Novaya Petrovka, you may notice that railway here is much flatter than ever before. That is no coincidence, as we have found the old roller-coaster-like railway track here too immersion breaking, and so the whole northern railway track was redone from scratch, along with necessary terrain and object changes. And now that Novaya Petrovka has a railway station, the biggest northern town - Novodmitrovsk - could not be missed. The appropriate spot was found and a new railway station was built south of Novodmitrovsk (just near the road that heads to Cernaya Polana). This railway station offers a spectacular view on Novodmitrovsk - the industrial railway station that was located outside of the Novodimitrovsk industrial complex has been moved into a much better place inside the complex itself, and now has a direct railway connection to Svetloyarsk. http://i.imgur.com/KPJmU14.jpg http://i.imgur.com/VRjb5uA.jpg  And just when you continue along the tracks towards Svetloyarsk, you will, sooner or later, encounter the northern railway exit that crosses Svetloyarsk - Novodmitrovsk valley on a brand new stone railway bridge. Unfortunately, I cannot just yet share the pictures of it, as our graphics artists are still at hard work on it, but I promise I will share the results once everything is ready. There is a lot more to cover for the upcoming .62 update, so stay tuned! 2017 is going to be a great year for Chernarus, so see you there! - Adam Franců / Map Designer  Community Spotlight In the December Status Report, we were contemplating whether players can be trusted and if you can safely turn your back to a person who seems friendly. Therefore, I want to introduce you to Dannboyy, who is well known in the DayZ community and some of you might have met him already - without even knowing it. Unfortunately, you will usually not survive meeting this nice lad.  He has a pleasant voice and is very kind, which is what you will notice first. And you will trust him easily. You will become friends. But is DannyBoyy exactly the kind of friend you would expect?    DannyBoyy’s videos are nicely made, very well cut and fun to watch. My personal favourite is \"The Friendly French Man\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHAZTkVFa3Q His latest video is named \"Sick\" and here you can see how wicked this young man is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opvprzw0cG0 Danny has no heart. And that is a reason why I like him! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTzDOw_tGMA Check his channel for more amazing videos. Don’t forget about our Official DayZ forums, too!

Brian would like to present major goals for 2017, Peter talks about reasons why the game is more hardcore than before and Baty summarizes your Christmas experiences. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! Its our first Status Report of the year - and as we&#39;ve had team members trickling back in through the first week of the year it might be a bit of a dry one, but lets take a look at the major goals going forward as well as what has occured so far in 2017. As work on 0.62 and the Beta milestones move forward, internal teams have contined in our goal to address the remaining issues in 0.61, and hopefully introduce vehicles to stable branch. Over the last few weeks the team has been cycling issues through exp, and onto stable directed at: Known Server Crashes Adjustments to Infected Behavior Adjustments to Hypothermia damage Fixes for Vehicle and Tent Lifetime Fixes for Invisible Body Parts Vehicles on Exp falling through terrain Fireplaces not being able to be placed in Stoves  In addition to these adjustments cycling through the Exp/Unstable branch, the development team is tracking and working to address a number of additional issues: VOIP Volume/Proximity Dropoff Vehicle client side performance Server side performance drops (Causing issues such as player position desync, delayed actions, etc) Server side memory consumption Additional known server crashes Infected spawning behavior issues Contined polish and work on addressing remaining issues with vehicles  As mentioned this is all in addition to ongoing work for both 0.62 and Beta milestones - Once we get internal builds in a state we are confident to start showing examples of both visuals, and client side performance for 0.62 we&#39;ll be sharing that. All of us here on the dev team are excited about this, as the small team of artists and support programmer begin to start preperation for branching for this milestone. I know this Status Report is chock full of cool and amazing things, but our first goals as we kick back into the groove for the new year are squarely focused on addressing the critical 0.61 issues you&#39;ve all been experiencing, and pushing forward into 0.62 and Beta. We all hope you had a great holiday season, and were able to spend time with your friends, families, and most important loved ones. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Peter With the release of 0.61 version of DayZ, one major issue raised by the community, which is still discussed back and forth, was the noticeable increase in difficulty of the PvE challenge in the game. I wanted to comment on this. Recently we took advantage of the new dynamic spawning system and because of that, concentration of infected is much higher then ever before (and I hope, there will be even more of them in future with the possibility of hordes when everything goes well). Now, when we finally achieved some reasonable numbers of infected in locations for intended gameplay purposes, it is unthinkable that they will just stand there, ignoring you while filling up empty space in settlements like scenery. It seems some don&#39;t remember how harsh infected were in the mod back in the days, when crawling on your belly for long minutes to observe a town to choose an entry point with the least resistance wasn&#39;t anything special. Don&#39;t forget that infected are meant to be a real threat to survival in Chernarus. You either need to avoid them or fight them (or eventually flee if you are lucky). There are some known issues in AI which need to be fixed and I understand that it may be hard to have a stealth approach with old habits that came from nearly nonexistent infected in the past, and without the planned presence indicator (combined with how much noise you make and how well you are visible) in the upcoming HUD, you can try to follow some general rules which might help you - stay low, keep distance and avoid their line of sight (yes, they have peripheral vision too). As far as close combat goes, it will be overhauled once the new player is ready and we already started to prototype it in meantime. Of course reported issues like infected running through seemingly closed doors, or spawning right next to you are unacceptable and will be fixed. If you would like to read more about design of the Infected, check out the Status Report released in 3rd March 2015. Also, rain and ensuing low body temperatures become a factor to consider in the fight for survival. Which again, is nothing unexpected and you shouldn&#39;t be afraid of it, just adapt to it. When all the systems like metabolism, diseases, injuries, stamina, weather impact, infected, predators and others will fall in place and became fine balanced you will witness a definitive survival game, where you need to be careful, have to plan ahead and get prepared for possible upcoming situations - this is DayZ people. Stay strong and never give up... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Community Spotlight Christmas and New Year celebrations are now behind us. You might have done some of your celebrating in DayZ, where Christmas trees were added and as a little present you might have found cute little teddy bears with surprises hidden inside them. They were able to protect your equipment from damage if you kept them with you. You were so excited about them, that you kept sending pictures showing your happy findings to our official Twitter. Dystopian Gaming sent a screenshot from his Christmas celebrations with the message: I ❤ my pink teddy!

Christmas is coming and we have a small gift for you - 0.61 on Stable branch,  Brian is going to tell you more about it. Peter talks about character growth and Mirek has information about vehicles, and their presence on Exp/Unstable. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, For those that weren't aware - we pushed 0.61.136770 to Steam stable branch yesterday. While there are still some issues we want to address (VOIP Volume, Supersonic cracks, Container contents desync, Infected footsteps volume, status modifiers stuck, and more) we looked at the experience the tests over the weekend provided, compared to what was going to be available to those on Stable branch over the holiday break and decided to go ahead and make the move. This allows us to ensure that users on Steam stable over the holiday season will be able to enjoy a stable DayZ 0.61 experience, while we continue to address the issues the team is concerned about on Exp/Unstable branch, and pending build health potentially push these over to Stable on our regularly scheduled Wednesday maintenance. Lets take a look at the milestone goals for 0.61 Stable, and then we'll cover what is currently on Exp/Unstable branch - as well as what is pending a new Exp/Unstable update. 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Predators (Wolves) Dynamic Shadows Network Synchronization Improvements New Server Browser  While we're happy to say that we've hit all of these milestone goals for 0.61, there are still issues that need to be addressed. Currently on Exp/Unstable we have build 0.61.136796 which is focused on the following changes: Fix for issues with container contents desync Fix to address supersonic cracks Adjustments of animal SFX levels Adjustments of infected footsteps levels Adjustment to Infected swing SFX  In addition to the build currently in test on Exp/Unstable we are focused on more Exp/Unstable updates to address: Status Modifier Updates Adjustments to Dynamic Lights VOIP Volume too quiet Issues with Hand Slots on corpses Some clients experiencing FPS drops  And lastly, as promised - future 0.61 Exp/Unstable builds will also be pushed (more than likely after the holiday break) with changes to test network sync on vehicles in DayZ. These builds likely will have vehicles set up to spawn ready to drive, but don't expect that change to follow through to Stable branch! We're all enjoying watching, reading, and hearing about your adventures in the latest change to Stable branch DayZ and we hope you all have a safe and enjoyable holiday break. This will be our last Status Report until January 10th, so see you all in the new year! - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Peter Don't get attached to your gear. This well known DayZ rule is there with us from very beginning. But then what is it, that you should be attached to? In short, it's your character, a survivor in post apocalyptic world full of infected and other threats, where every choice matters and has its consequences. It's easy to say that, but currently the only attachments your character has is his/her gear, his/her location within the world and his/her state. Losing all the gear, getting seriously sick or suddenly need fast travel often leads to sacrificing your character and starting from scratch as a fresh spawn. This behavior goes against the survival idea behind the DayZ in general. To build the value of your character we have planned three pillars which are connected to his life span and activities. Probably the most desired and awaited one is the visual representation of your character appearance like growing beards, scars, bloody hands and others which really reinforce connection between player and his character in world. Second pillar is pretty straightforward and it is connected directly to upcoming stamina system. With stamina in place, sprint wouldn't be intended for traversing long distances (that's what vehicles are for right?), however it will be an important factor for fleeing from immediate dangerous situations you may encounter on reasonable distances. Keeping the character alive longer will benefit from being able to carry more load until the penalty for overload in terms of shortening available stamina strikes in. Third pillar is obviously soft skills, which we have implemented in prototype state for quite some time. Same as with other stuff (for example stamina system mentioned above), this mechanic is waiting primarily for introducing his majesty, the new character himself, which as you may know will be formed from interconnected systems like new animation system, new controller and state machine, new physics, new damage system, new user actions and others. We had been speculating about soft skills for quite some time. Skills leveling system based on gained experience as we know it from traditional RPG games doesn't fit DayZ very well. First draft of soft skills was close to it, there was enclosed skill sets defined by actions which tried to mimic exact roles like medic, mechanic, hunter, builder, farmer and few others. Performing actions within skill sets add experience points to its pool and eventually raising its level. Such system leads to mindless grinding of actions without any meaningful gameplay context which, I believe can really easily ruin the gameplay experience for plenty of players just to witness such behavior. To minimize it, there needs to be some anti-grind solution like simple maximum cap for points per timeframe, or other more elaborate solution which demands more or less UI elements to be clear for players what are the rules and what's going on with experience and skills. In the end we decided to strip soft skills to bare minimum and dare to take different route once again so the vision of DayZ stays intact. Soft skills should not be mandatory, however they should reward long living, dedicated characters and reflect their past actions. Main idea behind it is simple - with little abstraction it's safe to say that if you can stitch up someone, you for sure are relatively able to gut animal or pick seeds from harvest, and on the other hand if you can build fences and watchtowers it should be relatively easy for you to cut tree down or dig garden plot. We introduced so called specialty, which is axis with two poles - precision and roughness, when a character is spawned the pointer is in the middle, neutral position. All actions in game can be divided between precise or rough ones. Even actions from traditional roles like medic can be categorized independently and sit somewhere else in specialty spectrum, for example transfusion as precise action while CPR as rough action. Performing actions in game is moving specialty dynamically towards one pole or other, every action can have different weight so it can move specialty in different amount, let's say while performing transfusion you gain more precision then with simple bandaging. Dedicated characters will be able to profit from current state of their specialty in terms of performing given specialty actions with shorter times, less materials used, wearing out tools less and more outcome gained as current specialty is multiplier for all of these. Not dedicated characters who don't care about specialty or those who feels like jack of all trades are not punished in this system as their specialty will be moving around the middle neutral position which means no penalty as both precise and rough actions will take default time, use default amount of material, worn out tools for default value and gain default outcome. Note, that we are not planning to punish dedicated characters yet (but there is a possibility to do so), if your specialty is more towards roughness you will be stitching yourself as you would do while your specialty is in middle position. I think it's kind of unique approach and it doesn't spoil DayZ with unnecessary tables, numbers, UI clutter and undesirable player behaviors. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek Today it will be quick again. We released stable version yesterday, but we're still working on fixing some major issues, like broken modifiers and statuses for some players. We might have a fix today on experimental branch. Looks like it's happening only when one player is connecting at the same time when another is disconnecting, which can happen very often for waiting players in the login queue. About vehicles, we made some progress with synchronization. It's still not perfect and you will experience some micro-teleportation during driving when it hits experimental branch, so please keep in mind that it won't be in its final state. Currently there is just one known blocking issue and it's related to passengers not being able to get out of vehicle sometimes. I don't want to give any promises, but it's still our target to release vehicles on experimental branch before Christmas and if we don't make it, it's priority No.1 at the beginning of next year. I wish you a Merry Christmas and happy New Year. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Community Spotlight I'm sure this happens to you sometimes. You meet a fresh spawn on the coast, befriend him, travel and loot together. But when he finds a gun with ammo, you hear a shot and your screen goes black and you are dead. Your trust in other players is down, but is it like that every time or is there hope for friendly players? http://i.imgur.com/ByMUtKh.jpg  YouTuber Cyborg Lyzard had an idea about a social experiment which would prove whether or not players are as cruel and hostile for real. When he released his first social experiment video it was a real successful. Look at this social experiment on update 0.59. Cyborg Lyzard gave a weapon with ammo to a random player and waited to see what happens next. DayZ Social Experiment - Giving Players a Gun 31% of players killed him immediately. The remaining 69% were friendly. This is not so bad. He tried it again. But in the second experiment he gave the players a gun with ruined ammo. What a lecture on trust and morality! Giving Players a Jammed Gun - A DayZ Social Experiment He repeated this experiment again a few weeks ago on update 0.60 and he found out that players are more friendly than before. DAYZ HAS BECOME FRIENDLIER - The Jammed Gun Experiment vol 2 And what about you? What would you do if somebody gave you a weapon with ammo? Would you put a bullet between his eyes or thank him and go your own way? Let me know on our official Twitter! Header image by: MrBlueAndQueenie Merry Christmas for you all! - Baty / Community Manager ",

Not dedicated characters who don't care about specialty or those who feels like jack of all trades are not punished in this system as their specialty will be moving around the middle neutral position which means no penalty as both precise and rough actions will take default time, use default amount of material, worn out tools for default value and gain default outcome. Note, that we are not planning to punish dedicated characters yet (but there is a possibility to do so), if your specialty is more towards roughness you will be stitching yourself as you would do while your specialty is in middle position. I think it's kind of unique approach and it doesn't spoil DayZ with unnecessary tables, numbers, UI clutter and undesirable player behaviors. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer  Dev Update/Mirek Today it will be quick again. We released stable version yesterday, but we're still working on fixing some major issues, like broken modifiers and statuses for some players. We might have a fix today on experimental branch. Looks like it's happening only when one player is connecting at the same time when another is disconnecting, which can happen very often for waiting players in the login queue. About vehicles, we made some progress with synchronization. It's still not perfect and you will experience some micro-teleportation during driving when it hits experimental branch, so please keep in mind that it won't be in its final state. Currently there is just one known blocking issue and it's related to passengers not being able to get out of vehicle sometimes. I don't want to give any promises, but it's still our target to release vehicles on experimental branch before Christmas and if we don't make it, it's priority No.1 at the beginning of next year. I wish you a Merry Christmas and happy New Year. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Community Spotlight I'm sure this happens to you sometimes. You meet a fresh spawn on the coast, befriend him, travel and loot together. But when he finds a gun with ammo, you hear a shot and your screen goes black and you are dead. Your trust in other players is down, but is it like that every time or is there hope for friendly players? http://i.imgur.com/ByMUtKh.jpg  YouTuber Cyborg Lyzard had an idea about a social experiment which would prove whether or not players are as cruel and hostile for real. When he released his first social experiment video it was a real successful. Look at this social experiment on update 0.59. Cyborg Lyzard gave a weapon with ammo to a random player and waited to see what happens next. DayZ Social Experiment - Giving Players a Gun 31% of players killed him immediately. The remaining 69% were friendly. This is not so bad. He tried it again. But in the second experiment he gave the players a gun with ruined ammo. What a lecture on trust and morality! Giving Players a Jammed Gun - A DayZ Social Experiment He repeated this experiment again a few weeks ago on update 0.60 and he found out that players are more friendly than before. DAYZ HAS BECOME FRIENDLIER - The Jammed Gun Experiment vol 2 And what about you? What would you do if somebody gave you a weapon with ammo? Would you put a bullet between his eyes or thank him and go your own way?

        "contents": "Dean Hall, the chief executive of indie studio Rocketwerkz and mastermind of zombie survival game DayZ, has written a scathing overview of virtual reality development&#x2014;within which he criticises the VR community&apos;s &quot;brigading&quot; of the tech&apos;s game creators. Titled &apos;The hard truth of Virtual Reality development&apos;, Hall&apos;s post on the <a href=\"https://m.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/5h51dd/the_hard_truth_about_virtual_reality_development/\">Vive subredddit</a> explores the disconnect between player expectation and the financial and technological feasibility of the medium at this stage.&#xA0; In September, Rocketwerkz released <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dean-halls-rocketwerkz-releases-vive-exclusive-out-of-ammo/\">Out of Ammo</a>, a VR game for the HTC Vive. Hall explains that despite being received well&#x2014;Out of Ammo boasts &apos;Very Positive&apos; reviews on <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/451840\">Steam</a> at the time of writing&#x2014;it&apos;s been &quot;very unprofitable&quot; and is unlikely to ever make money. Here&apos;s an excerpt of the post regarding player expectation and profits (or lackthereof) in relation to Out of Ammo:&#xA0; <em>&quot;I see constant posts, reviews, and comments like &quot;if only they added X, they will make so much money&quot;. The problem is that just because it is something you want, it does not mean that lots of people will want it nor that there are lots of people even available as customers.</em> <em>&quot;As an example, we added cooperative multiplayer to Out of Ammo as a &quot;drop-in&quot; feature (meaning you can hot-drop in SP to start a MP game). While there was an appreciable bump in sales, it was very short-lived and the reality was&#x2014;adding new features/content did not translate to an ongoing increase in sales. The adding of MP increased the unprofitability of Out of Ammo dramatically when we actually expected the opposite.</em> <em>&quot;From our standpoint, Out of Ammo has exceeded our sales predictions and achieved our internal objectives. However, it has been very unprofitable. It is extremely unlikely that it will ever be profitable. We are comfortable with this, and approached it as such. We expected to lose money and we had the funding internally to handle this. Consider then that Out of Ammo has sold unusually well compared to many other VR games.&quot;</em> Hall goes on to discuss the backlash certain studios have endured by opting for exclusivity deals and subsidies. Hall say that without these, less studios will make VR games at all. &quot;There is no money in it,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t mean &apos;money to go buy a Ferrari&apos;. I mean &apos;money to make payroll&apos;. People talk about developers who have taken Oculus/Facebook/Intel money like they&apos;ve sold out and gone off to buy an island somewhere. The reality is these developers made these deals because it is the only way their games could come out.&quot; He continues: &quot;Here is an example. We considered doing some timed exclusivity for Out of Ammo, because it was uneconomical to continue development. We decided not to because the money available would just help cover costs. The amount of money was not going to make anyone wealthy. Frankly, I applaud Oculus for fronting up and giving real money out with really very little expectations in return other than some timed-exclusivity. Without this subsidization there is no way a studio can break even, let alone make a profit.&quot; Hall then turns his attention to what he describes as the unfair &quot;brigading&quot; of developers for making these decisions from the tech&apos;s community. Hall stands against the &quot;many assumptions, attacks, bordering on abuse&quot; certain devs have faced&#x2014;saying such actions make him &quot;very embarrassed to be part of this community.&quot; Hall concludes by suggesting the sum of these complications and challenges has left he and his studio unlikely to pursue virtual reality in the immediate future, if ever again. &quot;Honestly, I don&apos;t think I want to make any more VR games. Our staff who work on VR games all want to rotate off after their work is done,&quot; he says. &quot;Privately, developers have been talking about this but nobody seems to feel comfortable talking about it publicly&#x2014;which I think will ultimately be bad.&quot; Hall&apos;s post is worth reading in its entirety and can be found in <a href=\"https://m.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/5h51dd/the_hard_truth_about_virtual_reality_development/\">this direction</a>.&#xA0; ",

We have Brian and Mirek on this week, mostly covering the recent improvements in server performance and our final push to have 0.61 out on Stable before Christmas. Additionally, Brian provides a bit of an insight on the intended DayZ survival experience, we have some exciting news regarding vehicles on Experimental branch and share several forums threads that we think you'll find interesting! Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Mirek Handpicked: DayZ Forums News Community Spotlight  Dev Update/Hicks As many of you may know, we're in an Exp/Unstable branch iteration phase - on the road to moving 0.61 to Stable branch. So, this Status Report I'm going to break my part into two. First part covering where we are with 0.61, and what our current critical issues for moving to Stable branch are. For the second part, I'll talk briefly about my opinion on 0.61 as a build and our goals with it as an experience. Now that all of our milestone goals for 0.61 have been implemented, we're currently in a rapid iteration phase. For those testing on Exp/Unstable branch this means a lot of things can change quickly, not to mention break. Over the last few builds, we've been focused on both improving server performance and trying to tackle issues that were caused as a byproduct of work on optimizing client network traffic. While that may be frustrating for those of you excited to try out 0.61, it is absolutely critical for the development process that we are able to iterate, and test these changes under a larger load than internal QA resources allow. Additionally, a good deal of the critical issues we've been seeing on the Exp/Unstable branch servers simply do not reproduce internally. Thus, us being able to test through the Unstable branch, and provide the team with the critical crashdumps, debug logs, and profiler data is is absolutely required for 0.61 to get to Stable branch on Steam as soon as possible. So, the next time you run across a server crash, frustrating bug, or gamebreaking issue while testing on Exp/Unstable - do your best not to get frustrated, head over to the feedback tracker and give as much data as you are able to. Every ticket and comment on the feedback tracker helps, even if you might not feel like it does! For Stable blocking issues, we're currently tracking: Characters twitching/stuttering when crossing rubble/bodies Client Crash(es) Some structures not having proper shadows Items stuck in hands Server crash(es) VOIP Too Loud Infected Vocalizations too loud Naked Characters / Silent Gunshots Mirek has some fascinating insight into some of the issues we've discussed above, as well as where we are with improving the vehicle simulation - I encourage you to scroll down and read what he has to say, the information is critical to understanding what is going on with the gameplay programming team (which has a large impact on how DayZ plays!) For the second part of my text this week, I'd like to comment on the swing towards survival with 0.61. It is no secret that DayZ set out to be a punishing survival title from the start of the project. Much of the mechanics that would drive this type of experience have been in prototyped phase, with the full functionality of them dependant upon technology from the engine, optimization to make them a threat, and so on - because of that, for the majority of our development period they have had little impact on gameplay unless you intentionally sought them out (or a bug related to them caused larger issues, such as the hyperthermia issue on 0.60). With this side of the game being present in such a state, most of DayZ's gameplay throughout the Early Access phase has centered around social interaction, and gunplay. With little incentive, or push for anything else to occur. As bugfixing, feature implementation, and optimization has allowed us to bring some of these mechanics more to the forefront of gameplay, I fully expect the large portion of the Early Access playerbase that might not keep up to date on development to be surprised, and even push back on these changes once they hit stable branch. I'm fully aware many of you love DayZ for the action you experience when you get into a gunfight, or the interesting (and often hillarious) social situations that player interaction creates. I do not want you to feel ignored. Everything in DayZ should come with a cost, be it struggling to survive, choosing to make a beeline for the closest military base looking to pick a fight, or creating a farming commune on the coast. The closer we move to Beta, and Early Access release this will become more apparent, and we will of course ensure that all styles of gameplay are as viable as possible, assuming you make the correct decisions to overcome the environment that seeks to kill you. Be it through starvation, infection, murder, the cold, or being eaten alive by wolves. Excited as we are by the slow but inevitable progression to that unforgiving survival experience we set out to create back in 2013, we're all very aware (as you all should be) - that this is a development build. Many critical pieces to the final puzzle are still missing, and there will be bugs, but we hope that you find these changes compelling, and enjoy your experience inside Chernarus even more. I've rambled on enough for this Status Report. I'm sure you all wanted to see more fancy screenshots or gifs - but these things slow down as the team wraps up what is in 0.61, and starts to focus on bugfixing in order to get to stable branch. Once we get past 0.61 and can start talking about 0.62, I'm sure we'll have more eye candy for you. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director  Dev Update/Mirek Last week, we were mostly focused on server performance improvements. We rewrote the updating strategy of network objects and the results are pretty good. This part is now about five times faster. On the other hand, it reintroduced the \"naked characters\" bug. Things like these can happen quite often, because this mechanism is very complex. As server performance is one of the major blockers of stable release, we had to release it into Experimental branch as soon as possible, so there wasn't much time to test it internally. I hope you won't get angry when things like these happen on Experimental branch. Another bug we found is that Central Economy (CE) limits for infected count didn't work properly, so too many infected were spawned over the entire map. This slows down server performance too much and it's the source of incorrectly updated character modifiers, or the \"persistent unconsciousness\". We also decreased the simulation rate of distant AI units, so this should help the server performance a lot, and it should also lead to a general decrease in network traffic. All of these fixes are scheduled for merge into Experimental branch this week (it's possible that some of them are already merged by the time you're reading this). Now about vehicles. In the last status report, I wrote about two blocking issues. The broken simulation of more players in a vehicle is now resolved, but because the server is now authoritative over player's position and movement, new small issue appeared. You won't be able to see some animations (like head movement) of remote players sitting in the vehicle. We're not planning to fix this this in 0.61 - we will be taking another look at this issue when the new player controller is merged in, because we want to avoid doing things twice. Client side correction still doesn't work well and I'm not sure how long it will take to fix this. Also, because we would like to release Stable build before Christmas, we will release it without vehicles. We will, however, continue releasing Experimental builds with vehicles included, when they get ready. We've also made other vehicle simulation improvements, which will hit Experimental. Here's the short list of changes: dashboards now reacts to switching vehicle lights player can use zoom when sitting in the passenger seat engine animation now correctly reacts to all user actions, damage etc. cars can be drown in any water, not only in the sea working particles from wheels updated suspension physics and collisions cars can now drive over small obstacles based on wheel's radius suspension along with wheels now correctly reacts to land surface The second part of my status report will be dedicated to infected. We are working closely with designers to tweak them a little bit for 0.61, mainly improving their movement and attacking. Pushing won't be solved, as there is still the issue with AI units having a new physical controller built on bullet physics, while players use the legacy Arma collision detection. In this case, what happens is that infected penetrates into the player (because it's unable to find a collision), but player detects that he's in collision with something and moves away from the collision. We won't be able to resolve this without the new player controller, so we're trying to at least improve it by tweaking some movement parameters. This is all for now from me. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Handpicked: DayZ Forums News Our official DayZ community forums provide the easiest way to discuss all things DayZ. The discussion there is free of the usual constraints of other channels, like the 140 character limit on Twitter or the occasionally questionable voting mechanism on Reddit. The forums have a solid user base and are also the place where developers have been staying in touch with survivors basically ever since the early DayZ Mod days. For these reasons, we'd love to drive most of the discussions there - both those where members of the dev team engage with you, the DayZ community, and those where you simply talk to fellow survivors. Supporting the effort to keep the forums a busy place, we'll do our best to handpick some of the new content from the forums for each new Status Report, and highlight interesting posts or threads created in the past two weeks as a recommended reading material. Occasionally, we will also open a discussion on a topic we want to hear you opinions on. Mind you, there will likely be exceptions to the schedule: Status Reports often turn into truly massive behemoths already, and development updates should always be the main focus here. Then, sometimes, people simply get too passionate about one or two particular threads and just won't let go of them - and so we usually don't need to drive additional traffic to such threads. But now, let's get to it, here's what's been happening on the official DayZ community forums lately. Friday Experimental Build Thread As you probably know, the 0.61 build we deployed on Friday suffered from some serious server crashing, and the discussion that unfolds on the first 5 or 6 pages in the related thread is a nice practical example of the nature of the Experimental/Unstable branch of DayZ. Often, even if you can't really play the game properly, you may have actually helped the development team (and we appreciate that a lot!):  https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_experimental-thread.jpg Read the thread »  While in this particular case, we've already gathered enough data about the crashes and our Deployment Engineer David sacrificed a bit of his weekend to revert the Experimental branch to previous build, it should be expected that Experimental builds may stay all over the place like that for some time. If that happens, we'd like to kindly ask for your patience, ask you to read this post over here to understand the nature of the Experimental branch, and ultimately ask you to switch over to Stable if you just want to play DayZ.  0.61 Stable Loot Thread Loot has always been a massive discussion topic in the community, and even internally. cs_wolf has started a thread where he's expressing his own hopes for the vanilla loot distribution of 0.61 on Stable, and while our design team is getting a clearer idea of where the vanilla experience is going themselves, feel free to fantasize about your own ideal setup with your fellow survivors: https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_061-loot.jpg Read the thread » Best DayZ Weapon Combo Thread When you've managed to get the basics to survive, it's the best time to get properly armed. kataro posted what he believes is the most efficient weapon combo in DayZ, and is asking you to share your own deadly combos. Even our Community Manager Baty, a truly experienced survivor, is sharing her personal favorite, so hit the image to read the thread and see what her best weapon combo consists of: https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_wepons-combo.jpg Read the thread »  BETA Content: CR 550 Rifle Thread The last entry in our handpicked section of the Status Report is actually a start of what will hopefully become a series of sneak peeks on some of the BETA milestone content and features. This week, Brian is keeping it simple, teasing the already announced CR 550 and asking what your personal expectations and hopes are for this new piece of weaponry: https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_cr550.jpg Read the thread »  Community Spotlight The news for update 0.61, which is on Experimental branch right now, are new dynamic shadows. Shadows look great, and the way you all are using them to take screenshots is really amazing. Besides facing the Infected, you also have to deal with an additional level of paranoia because dynamic shadows create a new dynamic, all happening in real time.  Player XRW64 utilizes the new shadows and backlighting to create an interesting visual experience with a friend. http://i.imgur.com/AtQpWnQ.jpg It's like open world DayZ shadow puppet theater!  http://i.imgur.com/9M9v3JL.jpg  Say hello to yourself! Test the new dynamic shadows and send us more rad images. Like JoeBandit. http://i.imgur.com/FDp8oIe.jpg Wanna get really creeped out? Imagine a silent infected hiding somewhere in this room. http://i.imgur.com/8fNhGCv.jpg  Bibix is a very successful streamer from France, and he has a great talent for capturing unique moment. We love his screenshots. For more pics click HERE. All of these screenshots are great examples of how creatively Bibix uses the flares. It really sets a frightening mood.  http://i.imgur.com/leoSVzD.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ATCIz6R.jpg I don't know about you, but I definitely don't want to find someone (or something) dangerous inside, much less an evil clown. This is what can happen in the world of Chernarus. http://i.imgur.com/2dgagsv.jpg If you play on Experimental/Unstable servers, don't forget to use our Feedback Tracker to submit bugs, and for the newest info or a place to share your screenshots, follow the official DayZ Development Team Twitter account.

We rewrote the updating strategy of network objects and the results are pretty good. This part is now about five times faster. On the other hand, it reintroduced the \"naked characters\" bug. Things like these can happen quite often, because this mechanism is very complex. As server performance is one of the major blockers of stable release, we had to release it into Experimental branch as soon as possible, so there wasn't much time to test it internally. I hope you won't get angry when things like these happen on Experimental branch. Another bug we found is that Central Economy (CE) limits for infected count didn't work properly, so too many infected were spawned over the entire map. This slows down server performance too much and it's the source of incorrectly updated character modifiers, or the \"persistent unconsciousness\". We also decreased the simulation rate of distant AI units, so this should help the server performance a lot, and it should also lead to a general decrease in network traffic. All of these fixes are scheduled for merge into Experimental branch this week (it's possible that some of them are already merged by the time you're reading this). Now about vehicles. In the last status report, I wrote about two blocking issues. The broken simulation of more players in a vehicle is now resolved, but because the server is now authoritative over player's position and movement, new small issue appeared. You won't be able to see some animations (like head movement) of remote players sitting in the vehicle. We're not planning to fix this this in 0.61 - we will be taking another look at this issue when the new player controller is merged in, because we want to avoid doing things twice. Client side correction still doesn't work well and I'm not sure how long it will take to fix this. Also, because we would like to release Stable build before Christmas, we will release it without vehicles. We will, however, continue releasing Experimental builds with vehicles included, when they get ready. We've also made other vehicle simulation improvements, which will hit Experimental. Here's the short list of changes: dashboards now reacts to switching vehicle lights player can use zoom when sitting in the passenger seat engine animation now correctly reacts to all user actions, damage etc. cars can be drown in any water, not only in the sea working particles from wheels updated suspension physics and collisions cars can now drive over small obstacles based on wheel's radius suspension along with wheels now correctly reacts to land surface The second part of my status report will be dedicated to infected. We are working closely with designers to tweak them a little bit for 0.61, mainly improving their movement and attacking. Pushing won't be solved, as there is still the issue with AI units having a new physical controller built on bullet physics, while players use the legacy Arma collision detection. In this case, what happens is that infected penetrates into the player (because it's unable to find a collision), but player detects that he's in collision with something and moves away from the collision. We won't be able to resolve this without the new player controller, so we're trying to at least improve it by tweaking some movement parameters. This is all for now from me. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer  Handpicked: DayZ Forums News Our official DayZ community forums provide the easiest way to discuss all things DayZ. The discussion there is free of the usual constraints of other channels, like the 140 character limit on Twitter or the occasionally questionable voting mechanism on Reddit. The forums have a solid user base and are also the place where developers have been staying in touch with survivors basically ever since the early DayZ Mod days. For these reasons, we'd love to drive most of the discussions there - both those where members of the dev team engage with you, the DayZ community, and those where you simply talk to fellow survivors. Supporting the effort to keep the forums a busy place, we'll do our best to handpick some of the new content from the forums for each new Status Report, and highlight interesting posts or threads created in the past two weeks as a recommended reading material. Occasionally, we will also open a discussion on a topic we want to hear you opinions on. Mind you, there will likely be exceptions to the schedule: Status Reports often turn into truly massive behemoths already, and development updates should always be the main focus here. Then, sometimes, people simply get too passionate about one or two particular threads and just won't let go of them - and so we usually don't need to drive additional traffic to such threads. But now, let's get to it, here's what's been happening on the official DayZ community forums lately. Friday Experimental Build Thread As you probably know, the 0.61 build we deployed on Friday suffered from some serious server crashing, and the discussion that unfolds on the first 5 or 6 pages in the related thread is a nice practical example of the nature of the Experimental/Unstable branch of DayZ. Often, even if you can't really play the game properly, you may have actually helped the development team (and we appreciate that a lot!):  https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_experimental-thread.jpg Read the thread »  While in this particular case, we've already gathered enough data about the crashes and our Deployment Engineer David sacrificed a bit of his weekend to revert the Experimental branch to previous build, it should be expected that Experimental builds may stay all over the place like that for some time. If that happens, we'd like to kindly ask for your patience, ask you to read this post over here to understand the nature of the Experimental branch, and ultimately ask you to switch over to Stable if you just want to play DayZ.  0.61 Stable Loot Thread Loot has always been a massive discussion topic in the community, and even internally. cs_wolf has started a thread where he's expressing his own hopes for the vanilla loot distribution of 0.61 on Stable, and while our design team is getting a clearer idea of where the vanilla experience is going themselves, feel free to fantasize about your own ideal setup with your fellow survivors: https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_061-loot.jpg Read the thread » Best DayZ Weapon Combo Thread When you've managed to get the basics to survive, it's the best time to get properly armed. kataro posted what he believes is the most efficient weapon combo in DayZ, and is asking you to share your own deadly combos. Even our Community Manager Baty, a truly experienced survivor, is sharing her personal favorite, so hit the image to read the thread and see what her best weapon combo consists of: https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_wepons-combo.jpg Read the thread »  BETA Content: CR 550 Rifle Thread The last entry in our handpicked section of the Status Report is actually a start of what will hopefully become a series of sneak peeks on some of the BETA milestone content and features. This week, Brian is keeping it simple, teasing the already announced CR 550 and asking what your personal expectations and hopes are for this new piece of weaponry: https://dayz.com/files/images/dayz_forums_handpicked_cr550.jpg Read the thread »  Community Spotlight The news for update 0.61, which is on Experimental branch right now, are new dynamic shadows. Shadows look great, and the way you all are using them to take screenshots is really amazing. Besides facing the Infected, you also have to deal with an additional level of paranoia because dynamic shadows create a new dynamic, all happening in real time.  Player XRW64 utilizes the new shadows and backlighting to create an interesting visual experience with a friend. http://i.imgur.com/AtQpWnQ.jpg It's like open world DayZ shadow puppet theater!  http://i.imgur.com/9M9v3JL.jpg  Say hello to yourself! Test the new dynamic shadows and send us more rad images. Like JoeBandit. http://i.imgur.com/FDp8oIe.jpg Wanna get really creeped out? Imagine a silent infected hiding somewhere in this room. http://i.imgur.com/8fNhGCv.jpg  Bibix is a very successful streamer from France, and he has a great talent for capturing unique moment. We love his screenshots. For more pics click HERE. All of these screenshots are great examples of how creatively Bibix uses the flares. It really sets a frightening mood.  http://i.imgur.com/leoSVzD.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ATCIz6R.jpg I don't know about you, but I definitely don't want to find someone (or something) dangerous inside, much less an evil clown.

Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Fido Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Adam Community Spotligh Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, So as many may know, it has been a pretty busy few weeks. We've had a good deal of experimental updates go out. For those that don't follow our posts on the official forums I'll try and give you all some perspective on what those updates have been aimed towards, and what our current priorities are for 0.61. Server side performance is one of our major goals for improvement on 0.61 experimental. Aside from stability (server side crashes), this has the largest impact on the actual effectiveness of the major changes gameplay wise for 0.61. When server performance drops below the acceptable line on these servers, it will reduce and impede the functionality of these areas. To give you guys an example, server performance can cause issues such as (but not limited to): Modifier/Damage Application can be stuck or delayed AI Reactions and Speed can be reduced (Infected, Wolves, Wild Animals) Door States can be reported incorrectly Obviously, as you can see the above issues are critical to have reduced as much as possible for 0.61 Stable. In addition to that we're looking into issues related to: Infected vocalizations being too quiet Infected response to firearm types being uniform (Suppressed/Lower db ammo not having proper effect) Infected able to push characters through/into model geometry (potentially causing characters to be stuck/die) VOIP Volume too loud / Adjustment not functioning Today we pushed an additional update for Exp/Unstable branch addressing previous issues caused by the latest update. Characters displaying as nude in some situations, some gunshot sounds not being played for all players, a new server crash, and some adjustment to predator AI behavior. We'll continue our march forward to getting 0.61 to Stable branch, and I think I speak for the whole team when I say we're all very excited to see the .61 changes in the hands of the larger stable branch update. This of course is not where we want DayZ to be yet, but it is a great step forward to that experience. Don't forget to grab a raincoat, don't waste those bullets, and head over to the official DayZ forums at forums.dayz.com to participate in the ongoing discussion! https://forums.dayz.com/topic/235530-exp-update-061136240/ 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Predators (Wolves) Dynamic Shadows Network Synchronization Improvements New Server Browser - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Dev Update/Peter With the recent addition of dynamic shadows casted from point lights and spot lights you can notice that they are quite dark due high intensities of lights in general. Overpowered lights are also causing unpleasant effect with camera exposure in new renderer as it tries to clamp and scale down huge differencies in scene luminancy for display output, which is resulting in pitch black surroundings outside the reach of lights. Power of lights was intentionally set higher in the past as they were compensating former pitch black nights in old RV engine renderer. In new renderer we approached the night time differently so there shouldn't be a need to change your gamma settings to see at least something when you play fair, of course those who doesn't we prevent unfair gamma abuse, but it's currently very low on priority list. What's on the top of the list regarding lights is for sure first balance pass of their intensities which should bring them to reasonable values for new renderer and its camera. You can expect to see these changes any time soon in 0.61 experimental releases. In future, for 0.62 version we would like to tackle day time and night time lighting to pull out more potential from new renderer combined visual updates for environment. Another troublesome behavior in 0.61 experimental releases you witnessed is infected and their movement and attacking. Actually it's quite a problem as currently both player character and infected are using different physics which doesn't like each other. However we are doing our best to fight these issues for 0.61 release via changes to configuration of AI which are the only weapons available for us now. With new player character, the old physics will be ditched and we gain more freedom in implementation of infected as well. One more thing I would like to mention is, that alongside new synchronization for players, vehicles are being worked on too. Count in they are getting so much love implementation wise so I hope we will be able to get some of these changes in 0.61 to make vehicles much more reliable and pleasure to drive. In the moonlight... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer Dev Update/Mirek Today will be just a small update. We merged server performance improvements into experimental branch, which introduced some new bugs, like gear despawning for remote players (that's also the reason why you can't hear some gunshots - because remote players don't have weapon in their hands). Anyway, we fixed this issue and it should be available in the next experimental update. New server performance improvements won't be enabled, as we have to deal with some new server crashes. When these are resolved, we will enable these improvements. Another big task is finishing vehicle synchronization and it's priority No. 1 now, as we want to bring vehicles back as soon as possible. There are two blockers now - client side correction and bad simulation, when two or more players are inside the vehicle. - Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Progammer Dev Update/Fido We’ve implemented terrain light reflection, variable coloring of trees (to add a bit more of the autumn feeling to Chernarus) and managed to progress with implementation of the new SimulWeather/TrueSky technology that we use for rendering the sky and clouds. These are merely some experimental visual effects, adding a little bit of “drama” to the world. Twitter account Trees 02 SimulWeather 01 SimulWeather 02 - Filip Doksanský / Lead Engine Programmer Dev Update/Viktor Today I would like to share with you a short video that demonstrates some of the new player character features. We still have a lot to do to make all transitions work perfectly and we are also in the process of refining the animations. There are a couple of interesting things in the video however. I would like to describe them for you in more detail. First of all you will notice new camera and movement. The animations have been polished so they feel more natural and fluent. The camera system has been redone and now we finally are able to adjust the camera to our needs. The version you see is still WIP and we are constantly working on it. But in short, new camera options allow us to adjust camera per stance or even per animation if needed. One of the most visible changes in the character movement is the possibility to interrupt almost any animation. This gives players greater control over the character. We have talked about this in previous status reports a few times already but it is a really big change compared to the old system. The way character look around is also different. Now we have the ability to use poses for look at things or aiming. By creating aim-spaces we are able to adjust character poses properly to certain angles which gives us perfect control over how the animations look in the game. Gestures, actions and other animations now are divided in two groups. Some are full body animations and some are upper body or other body part animations. This had to be done to allow movement while eating, drinking, greeting and many other situations. It's important however that all of them are interruptible as you can see in the video, with the LYING DOWN gesture. Most of these actions are made of three parts - IN, LOOP and OUT. We play IN animation at the beginning, then the character starts doing actions like chopping trees, and when players release the mouse button, OUT is activated.  New Player Character Features Video Hopefully you enjoyed this small video preview. I am pretty sure we will put together some more. For the next couple of weeks we will be focused on implementing animations for weapons, new combat and of course, continue improving the player character. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator Dev Update/Adam If you were playing .61 experimental over past few weeks, you may have noticed that we have added little military location on Sosnovka pass. Many of you were probably wondering why something like that was added, well, wonder no more. In this status report, I will cover major additions and changes to the military locations on Chernarus! Please bear with me, this may be a bit longer, but I feel that such thing needs to be explained in greater detail so we avoid any misinformation. The overall aim is to start finalizing important pieces of the map prior beta so there is a solid ground for associated Central Economy tweaks. To achieve that, we have been looking with designers into options on how to deal with the current situation of military loot locations, which is without doubt one of the main drivers behind the survivor movement on Chernarus. While we are quite satisfied with the way concrete military buildings are distributed as of now, the distribution of improvised military objects (mainly tents) is something we need to tackle. To get rid of military loot saturation within Myshkino and North West Airfield tent camps, we have decided to significantly reduce tent count in these locations and use newly created \"buffer of tents\" to either add to existing or create completely new military locations on Chernarus. So let me now go over the existing locations to see what was exactly changed including pictures (for some locations, keep in mind that they are work-in-progress). Myshkino tents Previously positioned on the coast south of Balota airfield, this military camp is one of the biggest military locations (as of .60, both in terms average loot availability and size). With this change, this camp has been stripped to 1/4 of its previous size. It has been built more or less from the scratch (so it will spice up the game-play for a while), but the general location still stays the same. For now - as I mentioned in October status report , we plan to change this area significantly as it is part of much bigger plan that is aimed to a complete re-design of western border of Chernarus (more on that in later status report/s). North West Airfield One of the most famous locations on Chernarus and well known since early days of DayZ Mod. Again, focus was on the military camp. This camp has been reduced to half and completely re-designed from scratch. I also did some minor modifications to its surroundings to - hopefully - offer some new tactical possibilities. Now I should mention that in no way you should consider this change to be permanent. We will soon formalize internally a clear plan for a complete re-design of North West Airfield. NWA is one of the few locations on Chernarus that basically still look like it did in Arma 2 version of Chernarus (and it looks completely out of place compared to other areas of Chernarus+). Even after the change within northern tents, we expect this area to be still very active and we will do our best to make sure that the airfield and its surroundings will look and play just as good. We will of course keep you updated as we progress towards this goal in future status report/s. North West Airfield 01 North West Airfield 02 Kamensk military base Fairly a new military location, which was however changed quite a lot over time (someone remembers pit of death?). It has received a slight face-lift along with its surroundings (and will receive more once new forests will arrive). This base utilized \"tent buffer\" and received number of military tents scattered among the ruins. This change along with other (smaller) additions to northern highway should hopefully increase traffic in this part of the map. Kamensk military base 01 Kamensk military base 02 Tisy military base One of the newest additions on Chernarus - concluding the northern expansion - is slowly crawling to be the location of first choice for all survivors, who seek top tier military equipment. Located in North West corner of the map, players need to venture through the whole Chernarus to reach it. To properly reward them for taking risks of doing so, large military camp was added into the perimeter of the base. This camp should give you an idea that it has been built in there to stay for a longer period of time - assuming its inhabitants would survive long enough. I should mention (the usual) disclaimer - Tisy military base is still not yet considered to be done and this military will change in the future. Tisy military base 01 Tisy military base 02 The new stuff! 9 military locations were added (with one already present on .61 experimental) on Chernarus. They are represented either through a military roadblocks of different sizes or through a smaller military camps (similar to the one in Stary Sobor). If you are looking for a list of new locations along with pictures, you wont find them here. I think we need to keep some things as a surprise, so I will let you figure it out once this hits public (experimental) branches. As you can see, Chernarus just got even more interesting to explore. And we are definitely not stopping there. Our aim is to have more locations that would resemble humanity's struggle to tackle day zero situation. But again, more on that in later status reports. We understand, that this particular change could easily be one of the most significant changes on Chernarus during its development and so - once it will hit consumer branches - we will be actively looking into our data and feedback from you to see how this change performs in the live environment and implemented tweaks if necessary. But of course feel free to discuss this already and let us know what you think! And given the progress that has been made in this particular task for the past few weeks, we are actively discussing the possibilities of testing these changes within .61 update (if not, then .62). So stay tuned! - Adam Franců / Map Designer Community Spotlight Wolves are the new thing for the 0.61 update, and we had amazing feedback from your side on our social networks and forums. You have sent us a lot of amazing screenshots and videos from your first contact with wolves. We are as excited as you are because we love to watch your reactions when you meet them for the first time. For the first time you are scared, you are running for your life, someone fights, someone dies. It is not easy to survive encounters with wolves. Look at this great reaction by John Connor who met these predators face-to-face. I didn't handle my first wolf encounter very well - DayZ Check out this amazing performance with wolves by CamCANTRUN . His touchingly sad story should affect everyone. In my case, he's definitely succeeded. When Man Becomes Prey When Man Becomes Prey II Player jakon72 dealt with the wolf in his own way, He killed it and made a dinner from it when the wolf attacked him. IIf you did not meet any wolves yet, you can try to find them on our Experimental/Unstable servers. Check the map of wolf locations by DAYZTV here . I hope you enjoy 0.61, and if you have something you'd like to share, send it to out official Twitter account . Header image by: Sweetest_Kill - Baty / Community Manager ",

We play IN animation at the beginning, then the character starts doing actions like chopping trees, and when players release the mouse button, OUT is activated.  New Player Character Features Video Hopefully you enjoyed this small video preview. I am pretty sure we will put together some more. For the next couple of weeks we will be focused on implementing animations for weapons, new combat and of course, continue improving the player character. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator Dev Update/Adam If you were playing .61 experimental over past few weeks, you may have noticed that we have added little military location on Sosnovka pass. Many of you were probably wondering why something like that was added, well, wonder no more. In this status report, I will cover major additions and changes to the military locations on Chernarus! Please bear with me, this may be a bit longer, but I feel that such thing needs to be explained in greater detail so we avoid any misinformation. The overall aim is to start finalizing important pieces of the map prior beta so there is a solid ground for associated Central Economy tweaks. To achieve that, we have been looking with designers into options on how to deal with the current situation of military loot locations, which is without doubt one of the main drivers behind the survivor movement on Chernarus. While we are quite satisfied with the way concrete military buildings are distributed as of now, the distribution of improvised military objects (mainly tents) is something we need to tackle. To get rid of military loot saturation within Myshkino and North West Airfield tent camps, we have decided to significantly reduce tent count in these locations and use newly created \"buffer of tents\" to either add to existing or create completely new military locations on Chernarus. So let me now go over the existing locations to see what was exactly changed including pictures (for some locations, keep in mind that they are work-in-progress). Myshkino tents Previously positioned on the coast south of Balota airfield, this military camp is one of the biggest military locations (as of .60, both in terms average loot availability and size). With this change, this camp has been stripped to 1/4 of its previous size. It has been built more or less from the scratch (so it will spice up the game-play for a while), but the general location still stays the same. For now - as I mentioned in October status report , we plan to change this area significantly as it is part of much bigger plan that is aimed to a complete re-design of western border of Chernarus (more on that in later status report/s). North West Airfield One of the most famous locations on Chernarus and well known since early days of DayZ Mod. Again, focus was on the military camp. This camp has been reduced to half and completely re-designed from scratch. I also did some minor modifications to its surroundings to - hopefully - offer some new tactical possibilities. Now I should mention that in no way you should consider this change to be permanent. We will soon formalize internally a clear plan for a complete re-design of North West Airfield. NWA is one of the few locations on Chernarus that basically still look like it did in Arma 2 version of Chernarus (and it looks completely out of place compared to other areas of Chernarus+). Even after the change within northern tents, we expect this area to be still very active and we will do our best to make sure that the airfield and its surroundings will look and play just as good. We will of course keep you updated as we progress towards this goal in future status report/s. North West Airfield 01 North West Airfield 02 Kamensk military base Fairly a new military location, which was however changed quite a lot over time (someone remembers pit of death?). It has received a slight face-lift along with its surroundings (and will receive more once new forests will arrive). This base utilized \"tent buffer\" and received number of military tents scattered among the ruins. This change along with other (smaller) additions to northern highway should hopefully increase traffic in this part of the map. Kamensk military base 01 Kamensk military base 02 Tisy military base One of the newest additions on Chernarus - concluding the northern expansion - is slowly crawling to be the location of first choice for all survivors, who seek top tier military equipment. Located in North West corner of the map, players need to venture through the whole Chernarus to reach it. To properly reward them for taking risks of doing so, large military camp was added into the perimeter of the base. This camp should give you an idea that it has been built in there to stay for a longer period of time - assuming its inhabitants would survive long enough. I should mention (the usual) disclaimer - Tisy military base is still not yet considered to be done and this military will change in the future. Tisy military base 01 Tisy military base 02 The new stuff! 9 military locations were added (with one already present on .61 experimental) on Chernarus. They are represented either through a military roadblocks of different sizes or through a smaller military camps (similar to the one in Stary Sobor). If you are looking for a list of new locations along with pictures, you wont find them here. I think we need to keep some things as a surprise, so I will let you figure it out once this hits public (experimental) branches. As you can see, Chernarus just got even more interesting to explore. And we are definitely not stopping there. Our aim is to have more locations that would resemble humanity's struggle to tackle day zero situation. But again, more on that in later status reports. We understand, that this particular change could easily be one of the most significant changes on Chernarus during its development and so - once it will hit consumer branches - we will be actively looking into our data and feedback from you to see how this change performs in the live environment and implemented tweaks if necessary. But of course feel free to discuss this already and let us know what you think! And given the progress that has been made in this particular task for the past few weeks, we are actively discussing the possibilities of testing these changes within .61 update (if not, then .62). So stay tuned! - Adam Franců / Map Designer Community Spotlight Wolves are the new thing for the 0.61 update, and we had amazing feedback from your side on our social networks and forums. You have sent us a lot of amazing screenshots and videos from your first contact with wolves. We are as excited as you are because we love to watch your reactions when you meet them for the first time. For the first time you are scared, you are running for your life, someone fights, someone dies. It is not easy to survive encounters with wolves. Look at this great reaction by John Connor who met these predators face-to-face. I didn't handle my first wolf encounter very well - DayZ Check out this amazing performance with wolves by CamCANTRUN . His touchingly sad story should affect everyone. In my case, he's definitely succeeded. When Man Becomes Prey When Man Becomes Prey II Player jakon72 dealt with the wolf in his own way, He killed it and made a dinner from it when the wolf attacked him. IIf you did not meet any wolves yet, you can try to find them on our Experimental/Unstable servers. Check the map of wolf locations by DAYZTV here . I hope you enjoy 0.61, and if you have something you'd like to share, send it to out official Twitter account . Header image by: Sweetest_Kill - Baty / Community Manager ",

They'll be sharing the latest about the 0.62 presentation at PAX Australia, 0.61 Experimental public testing, and some details about what's going on here at the DayZ offices. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Dustin Community Spotligh Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, It has been a pretty exciting (and potentially stressful at times) two weeks for development on DayZ, both in the .61 development and the discussion on moving forward beyond that. This Status Report I'll go over what we're currently focusing addressing on 0.61 experimental, and then I'm going to summarize the main points from the 0.62 and Beyond talk at PAX Australia. As many of you may know, we've gone through several iterations on Experimental/Unstable branch for 0.61. With our principle focus being on server stability, and performance. The gameplay programming team has been experimenting with several possible options in improving our server side performance, which you as survivors will directly see as improved infected responsivity and speed, faster user actions, and general overall improved responsivity to your interactions with the world. While we've made some strong improvements in regards to stability, we're not quite where we'd like to be with server performance. As I've mentioned many times before - server performance is and will continue to be an ongoing area of focus for us throughout development and into the beta phase. That said, it is especially important to the 0.61 experience, given that at a gameplay level the dynamic spawning of infected is such a corner stone. I won't spend too much time talking about this, as Mirek is going to elaborate a bit on some of the different changes his team has been working on in this area further in to the SR. Enough rambling, lets take a look at what critical issues we have on 0.61 Exp/Unstable. VOIP Icon missing when using VOIP Server Performance can dip below acceptable line Character deformation when entering structure under high ping Character model twitching when standing on bodies Client side crashes (Several) VOIP Volume balancing Character sounds balancing Characters hands stuck raised in some situations Server side crashes tied to specific item Character roll backs during some server crashes Reconnecting / Manipulating weapon magazine can prevent magazine use Keep in mind this is just a list of critical fixes for 0.61 Stable - and is fluid based on the feedback and data we get back from 0.61 Experimental/Unstable builds. If you've encountered other critical issues, please let us know about it via our feedback tracker or on our official forums . As mentioned earlier, I was at PAX Australia in Melbourne this last weekend and had the opportunity to talk about where we are headed after 0.61 hits stable with the Australian and New Zealand community. For those that would rather not read my rambling wall of texts, I will be re-recording the audio along with the presentation slides. However, for those that *don't* mind reading - I'm going to summarize the presentation in this Status Report. (We'll jump past the start of the presentation that talks about .61, as if you are reading a Status Report this is probably redundant information) Now that .61 is on Experimental/Unstable - lets take a look at what our plans internally are for development beyond .61 hitting Stable branch on Steam. Once this occurs, the primary bulk of the DayZ development team will be switching their focus to the \"Beta\" milestone for DayZ. Beta for us is a major point in our development, and it goes without saying that it has its own challenge and hurdles. This milestone is focused on the following areas: New Animation System New Player Controller New User Actions Improved Vehicle Physical Simulation And that big ol' feature/content backlog (that is dependant on these technologies) Now what do I mean when I say \"Backlog\"? Well, as many of you may be aware - there are a good deal of gameplay systems, mechanics, items, and more that we have talked about in previous Status Reports, presentations, and are sitting in the \"In Progress\" column on our Trello. Nearly every single one of them are dependant upon the technologies listed above, either through technical limitation, or having just been written from the ground up on Enforce script and designed with the new tech specifically in mind. At the presentation in Australia I gave the following examples: Base Building Improvements Electrical System items Improvements Character Lifespan New Vehicles New Items & Weapons Now, one of the key points I tried to point out during this presentation was how critical this milestone is to the progress towards the final version of DayZ. Work on not only the technologies that power this milestone, but all the content and mechanics that we hope to hit with it, has been an ongoing task throughout DayZ's development. Artists, Designers, Animators, and Programmers have been working for quite some time on changes to DayZ that can't hit the Early Access userbase until these changes to DayZ's engine are ready to be merged into the main trunk of our development. This won't be a simple task, either. The work described is very similar to the change to DayZ's rendering technology in its risk and complexity. I've likened these milestone goals to a changing of the spine of DayZ, at least at a gameplay level. So, as mentioned before - once we get 0.61 to Stable branch - the primary bulk of DayZ's development team shifts all its focus on this goal. Exactly how much of that feature backlog we will be able to get into this milestone will be discussed in more detail in future Status Reports, once we can properly gauge any potential risk - but make no mistake, this is both an exciting time for us on the development team, but also a major task. While the primary bulk of the team is focused on this, our beta milestone - a small 5 man team (Comprised mostly of artists, environment designers, and support from one programmer) will be branching off to work on a 0.62 update to DayZ Early Access focused on a much needed overhaul of Chernarus's visual fidelity. What exactly do we mean by that? Well - lets take a look.

        "contents": "The company behind Arma 3 and DayZ today announced a pair of new games, and they're both playable now in an early form. Ylands and Project Argo are products of a new part of the studio dedicated to experimental games called Bohemia Incubator. While Bohemia says that its core focus is on Arma, DayZ, and Take On, it sees Incubator as a chance to test concepts at a very early stage. \"There are several reasons for wanting to release experimental games and involve players into their development process. First and foremost, it can help us test whether certain design concepts work or not (and if they're fun!). But it can also help guide the development of our technology and tools (such as our next engine, Enfusion), or supporting services, like networking solutions and online community platforms,\" reads an FAQ response on <a href=\"https://incubator.bistudio.com/\"> incubator.bistudio.com </a>. The new projects are very distinct. Ylands is a sandbox singleplayer and multiplayer building game built in the Unity engine that's intended for all ages. It's colorful and low-poly, but Bohemia says it's \"powered by advanced simulations,\" in the spirit of its other, high-fidelity games. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgOwxhX5cSI\"> trailer </a> shows off a few different settings and biomes, from a Wild West town to an archaeological site, forest, farm, samurai battle arena, to a midnight castle siege. It's currently available in <a href=\"https://store.bistudio.com/products/ylands\"> Bohemia's store </a> for $10, or as a free, time-limited trial. Project Argo. Project Argo is an Arma 3 total conversion that transforms Bohemia's massive military sim into a five-on-five tactical game. Right now Argo has three modes: two are focused on controlling sectors or capture points, and another on attack-and-defend. \"In each of the three game modes, players also have the option to capture a paradrop, which can dramatically change the tide of battle adding yet another tactical element to the confrontation,\" reads the <a href=\"https://www.projectargo.net/game\"> Argo website </a>. Maybe most interestingly, Argo will play out on a renovated version of Malden, the original terrain in the first Arma game. This in-development remake of Malden will be added to Arma 3 as free DLC in June 2017, per the <a href=\"https://arma3.com/news/arma-3-roadmap-2016-17#.WBjwtPkrIuU\"> Arma 3 roadmap </a>. An open <a href=\"https://store.bistudio.com/products/project-argo\"> prototype version </a> of Argo is available for the next three or four months. Alongside its announcement, Bohemia disclaims that these and other Incubator projects aren't guaranteed a final release. \"Bohemia Incubator might seem to be very similar to Steam Early Access, but we'd like to make clear that the Incubator games can be far more rough or experimental,\" CEO Marek Spanel says in the announcement video. \"We may even decide to cancel or stop supporting an Incubator game. And this is also why players will often be able to test the games for free.\" In my view, this is all about Bohemia setting itself up to build or discover the next DayZ. The Early Access survival game, which began as an Arma 2 mod, sold 3 million copies as of January 2015, and its success has also driven interest in Arma 3, which remains one of the most popular games on Steam. As it did with the <a href=\"http://makearmanotwar.com/\"> Make Arma, Not War </a> modding competition, Bohemia continues its search for new ideas inside and outside its milsim heritage. ",

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/3TMuVxs.jpg Afternoon Survivors, Another status report Tuesday comes around with Brian, Peter, Viktor, Mirek and Adam. They will share the latest info on where we are at in the development process. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Over the last two weeks we've been doing a lot of iteration, and regression testing on the critical issues preventing 0.61 Experimental/Unstable branch update. As you all may recall, those issues are server side performance and player to player sync. For the end user, that translates into A) How fluid your actions are in game (As well as how functional AI is) and B) How you see, and hear other players (Think sliding, player position, and gun shot sounds). The gameplay programming team (lead by Miroslav Manena) has made some big improvements in the issues previously mentioned regarding poor performance in high ping situations, and in the player to player sync. We're no longer seeing the jittering/hitching we previously saw in the 100+ MS range, and player to player sync issues are greatly reduced - however we are still able to reproduce them in some situations. The list of stable blockers includes several other issues (of which I will list below) but experimental blocking issues really currently is isolated to getting server performance to an acceptable rate with the dynamic spawning of infected and 40-60 player population, and knocking out the last issues with player to player sync listed above. This is where the bulk of gameplay programming, and QA resources are currently focused. I can say personally from the frequent multiplayer test passes we have been doing nearly every day these last two weeks, I have not encountered a single case of traditional desync. However, that said - I am personally holding my breath until we see how this performs under a larger player population such as the experimental/unstable branch. In addition to that, we've taken a look at some of the feedback on our forums about the .61 version of the server browser and its filtering options and made changes accordingly. You can see the latest look of it on our Trello, which should be linked below. http://i.imgur.com/kHqqUFm.jpg Additionally, I wanted to take the opportunity to wish our Community Manager Smoss a fond farewell. Michael is pursuing some new and awesome opportunities that have come his way, and has spent the last few weeks bringing up to speed a new member of our Community Team - Baty!. Baty is a devout DayZ lover, and internal hire for us. She has been working with us for quite some time now on the support and test side of the fence, and brings with her a strong knowledge of DayZ as an active member of the Czech and Twitch DayZ communities. I'll give Baty an opportunity to introduce herself below: \"My name is Zuzana Cinková alias Baty Alquawen. Videogames have taken a part in my life as long as I can remember. My favorite genre is tactical FPS, RPG and survival games. I have five years long experience on gaming scene in several roles like journalist, PR, marketing and community. I worked on communities for Czech region of Ubisoft (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Rocksmith, Rayman series etc.), Codemasters and SEGA franchises for 4 years. The beginning of my DayZ journey started on 28th December 2013 since then I have more than 1500 hours of private gameplay time. I play a lot of styles - role-play, survival, friendly and PVP which I play with my clan on dedicated servers. My hobbies are streaming games, cosplay and cats (yes, I am crazy cat lady). My work at Bohemia Interactive started as tester and now, I am fulfilling my dream to be community manager. I really hope that all this is a great foundation for my DayZ community work. So...

We try to take an active role there as much as possible, and discuss our perspectives on the state of the build, as well as share insights into development in general.

There are myriad different ones across the whole of Chernarus. Small ones or large ones, single or doubled-sided, in structures or in the open, all these doors are waiting for you to interact with them. Let's focus on their core functionality now which is opening and going through. It's interesting to observe how such a simple action is causing so much trouble. Opening toward you, a door won't hesitate to displace your position in the world and in some specific cases, clip through you or, in the worst case scenario, break your leg (which was a common problem in the mod days, some survivors were more afraid of doors than infected). And it doesn't end at characters. A good example is shooting vehicles into orbit once collision geometry of doors penetrates vehicle geometry, which is easy to achieve as swinging of doors are driven by simple rotating animations ignoring physics completely during the swing. These issues are just unacceptable and they are crippling the overall experience. There are a few possible ways to address and resolve this problem. For example, the easiest choice will be to remove all the doors. While this sounds like a silly idea, it's still a functional one. However, don't worry, it's clearly not a suitable solution for DayZ as doors should also act not only as obstacles for navigation through the environment, but they should also offer a tactical advantage against infected or other survivors, especially with advanced barricading in the future. Another option will be locking characters into the animation of opening the door. You know the drill, hand catches handle, press it down and start pulling the door toward you. Once done, you are free to move again. Such a solution, as visually appealing as it can be to watch, can become frustrating in the long run, especially in competitive environments where every second counts, and I bet we all agree that fluid movement and responsiveness is crucial for DayZ. From my point of view there is one solution which is very close to ideal, and we started to experiment with it; doors which swing in both directions. At first I thought it a bit unacceptable as we are trying to stay as authentic as possible, and such doors are quite rare even in real life. However, from a gameplay perspective it solves plenty of issues and I would be happy to make concessions as a designer and a player if its helpful. The most valuable benefit is that they will never interfere with you and your movement through the doorway, as they will always swings away from you when opening. It's true that some door placements needs to be adjusted so they don't collide with each other. Also there are some structures where such a door design doesn't make much sense, from the top of my head, jail cells or outhouses, but for the greater good it could be worked through. On the other hand, garages are more of a problem with such an approach, as it will be possible to put a vehicle in, close the doors from the outside, and then never be able to get back in as collision with vehicles will stop them, but every problem has a solution. Also barricading will benefit from this door behavior, as planks could be physical objects where, so when you try to open a door against them, the door strikes the planks. Or jamming the door with a barrel will be a possibility. While it still could have some very specific issues which can be tackled on their own I think it's the right approach and I hope we will succeed with it as it will add to the experience and overall in-game possibilities.

They will share the latest info on where we are at in the development process. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Adam Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Over the last two weeks we've been doing a lot of iteration, and regression testing on the critical issues preventing 0.61 Experimental/Unstable branch update. As you all may recall, those issues are server side performance and player to player sync. For the end user, that translates into A) How fluid your actions are in game (As well as how functional AI is) and B) How you see, and hear other players (Think sliding, player position, and gun shot sounds). The gameplay programming team (lead by Miroslav Manena) has made some big improvements in the issues previously mentioned regarding poor performance in high ping situations, and in the player to player sync. We're no longer seeing the jittering/hitching we previously saw in the 100+ MS range, and player to player sync issues are greatly reduced - however we are still able to reproduce them in some situations. The list of stable blockers includes several other issues (of which I will list below) but experimental blocking issues really currently is isolated to getting server performance to an acceptable rate with the dynamic spawning of infected and 40-60 player population, and knocking out the last issues with player to player sync listed above. This is where the bulk of gameplay programming, and QA resources are currently focused. I can say personally from the frequent multiplayer test passes we have been doing nearly every day these last two weeks, I have not encountered a single case of traditional desync. However, that said - I am personally holding my breath until we see how this performs under a larger player population such as the experimental/unstable branch. In addition to that, we've taken a look at some of the feedback on our forums about the .61 version of the server browser and its filtering options and made changes accordingly. You can see the latest look of it on our Trello, which should be linked below. http://i.imgur.com/kHqqUFm.jpg Additionally, I wanted to take the opportunity to wish our Community Manager Smoss a fond farewell. Michael is pursuing some new and awesome opportunities that have come his way, and has spent the last few weeks bringing up to speed a new member of our Community Team - Baty!. Baty is a devout DayZ lover, and internal hire for us. She has been working with us for quite some time now on the support and test side of the fence, and brings with her a strong knowledge of DayZ as an active member of the Czech and Twitch DayZ communities. I'll give Baty an opportunity to introduce herself below: \"My name is Zuzana Cinková alias Baty Alquawen. Videogames have taken a part in my life as long as I can remember. My favorite genre is tactical FPS, RPG and survival games. I have five years long experience on gaming scene in several roles like journalist, PR, marketing and community. I worked on communities for Czech region of Ubisoft (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Rocksmith, Rayman series etc.), Codemasters and SEGA franchises for 4 years. The beginning of my DayZ journey started on 28th December 2013 since then I have more than 1500 hours of private gameplay time. I play a lot of styles - role-play, survival, friendly and PVP which I play with my clan on dedicated servers. My hobbies are streaming games, cosplay and cats (yes, I am crazy cat lady). My work at Bohemia Interactive started as tester and now, I am fulfilling my dream to be community manager. I really hope that all this is a great foundation for my DayZ community work. So...

Well, let me derail that train right away. We're not quite there yet. Fortunately in this Status Report I'll do my best to fill you guys in on what the dang hold up is, and our progress against getting it onto experimental/unstable branch since the last Status Report. In addition, Peter will be talking briefly about our designs for the DayZ Launcher, and Viktor will be talking about some of the animation teams work towards the implementation of the new animation system. As well, the Trello should have some new renders of the CR 550 and its magazines, as well as an updated image of the current look of the server browser. https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/547c4a954dad7ad76b9cb6a1/57fd0c1f2555131d79ddf091/37acf9ea9b6cf1ddc8517e651e7a1b58/20161011060347_1.jpg Over the last two weeks the team has been doing almost daily all-hands multiplayer tests in an effort to isolate the remaining blocking issues getting us to experimental/unstable. Those issues specifically are fundamental to the base gameplay of DayZ. Namely server side performance, and player-to-player synchronization. I'm sure some of you are wondering why we're currently fighting new issues related to synchronization of players, as one of the milestone goals for .61 is just that - improving and reducing the chance for client/server desynchronization. The work Miroslav, and the gameplay programming team have been doing in this area has made massive changes to the communication process between client and server for DayZ - and it has most definitely changed how a lot of the behaviour is manifested client side. While the improvements in client/server synchronization have been outstanding (and lets hold our breath until the larger testing pool gets ahold of them to be safe) they have (not unexpectedly mind you) caused new issues. Thanks to the frequent all hands MP sessions we've had over the last few weeks, we have isolated repro steps and proper bug data on all of the ones we have encountered. As we get closer to .61 hitting experimental/unstable and look at the road beyond .61, towards massive engine and gameplay changes such as the new animation system, player controller, user actions, and so on we have to be very aware of the fact that huge changes like that are going to take time to get ready for Steam, and thus we have to make sure that the build that you'll all be playing while we work on that is as enjoyable and functional as we can make it. We're all very aware that the journey we've all taken together in Early Access has not been the easiest, and can be massively frustrating at times. However, speaking for myself I think we've opted for the harder road in the short term, but the road that leads to the best final product - and always keeps the focus on 1.0 being the best DayZ it can be, first and foremost. Enough rambling from me though, lets dig into exactly what our blocking issues are for .61 (and keep in mind, these are Must-Fix for Stable branch, not all of these are must fix for Experimental/Unstable) Player SFX significantly quieter than others: (Fix for this is in testing now) Network: Players can become severely out of sync with each other: (Gameplay Programming team working on a fix for this currently) Client crash when exiting title Player position hitching when navigating collision Magazine ammo count quantity reporting incorrectly Items can be stuck in hands under certain cancel action situations Dynamic Infected spawning without player trigger Some infected not responding to triggers (Fix in test currently) Before I sign off for this Status Report - I'd like to encourage you all to visit, and participate in our official forums. I do my best to jump into as many discussions as possible, and as we move closer to the major systems dependencies that are holding back large gameplay systems changes and updates such as soft skills, weapon customization, base building and so on I would love to see the discussion around those mechanics and systems start to open up more. If you're interested - you'll find me at forums.dayz.com 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Predators (Wolves) Dynamic Shadows Network Synchronization Improvements New Server Browser - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Dev Update/Peter In the upcoming 0.61 version of DayZ you will be able to try out the brand new Server Browser which doesn't bog fps down like the old one, and it's a breeze to use with all these filter options (mind that per character filter won’t be part of 0.61 release as it's not yet fully implemented). Alongside the new server browser I hinted at the external launcher a few status reports ago, so why not uncover a bit of information about it now. The most important function of a launcher is obviously to run modded DayZ. Without mods there would be hardly any launcher at all. Actually it's possible to have mods support even without the launcher but that will lead to unpleasant yet necessary restarts of the game as different addons should be loaded at start, unless you are launching them from command line. However, both cases aren't very user friendly. In the launcher you can easily manage installed mods and overview their current state and additional information like description, author, source and others. Apart from the game section for mod selection, there are also two other separated sections dedicated for tools and servers with central economy including their startup parameters and launch buttons for additional value which offers easy discovery of options of DayZ as a platform to users that aren't aware of them. Last but not least, the launcher will also serve as the official DayZ communication channel aggregating news, status reports, change logs of releases, Q&A videos, WIP showcase and hands on videos, maintenance and community spotlight. The launcher is currently being implemented with all requirements mentioned above with the aim to be well arranged and simple to use and while it might not see daylight publicly in 0.61 it will be released once DayZ is ready to be open for modding community. See you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer Dev Update/Viktor As I have mentioned in last status report the animation team is busy with many tasks related to player character. We are doing polishing pass for unarmed and rifle locomotions. That includes work on animations and graph as well. The animations are being adjusted so they blend nicely and feel more natural which has to be on a par with the player graph where blendtimes between animations need to feel right and fluent. There is also ongoing work on user actions. Since these are already in the player graph now we need to connect them with the designers scripts so the animations are played when some actions happen. This is a big task as it includes drinking, eating, all the medical action, as well as any item usage and even gestures. We have some progress regarding the combat as well. We do have few prototypes now like combat stances for unarmed, one handed item and two handed item and some simple attack animations. This week we will have a meetng and more discussions about the combat itself and the animations style. - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator Community Spotlight http://i.imgur.com/Rwnzi3B.png Keeping in trend with highlighting some of the awesome DayZ communities, we'd really like to put focus on one of the largest community sites out there (currently +4 million hits/month.) There's a good chance have already crossed paths with this one which is simply known as: DayZTV! DayZTV has been around basically since forever, and they have a really nice site that provides a lot of options and info for users via the many sections on their site. As an example; if you're looking for other players to team up with for a session, or a more permanent group to team up with, you should be able to find plenty via the Broadcast tab in the Forum section, and if you feel like setting up an event for yourself and others, you can do so via the Community --> Community Server selection. For this, DayZTV have also been helpful for users by setting up a Discord server where you can reach other players. What is also relly nice about DayZTV is that via the Live section you will find a selection of live Twitch streams from users playing DayZ, and outside of that, there is a boatload of helpful info for users stowed away under other sections such as Guides for example. We can only imagine how much work and effort it must take to run and develop the site, and we really appreciate the massive support that DayZTV has provided for so long in regards to promoting DayZ as well as DayZ related news while it is in development! As always, in case you are part of a community that you would like to see highlighted, or if you are a contect creator looking to share your stories and footage, just send us some info at support@dayz.com and we'll be happy to have a look!

DayZTV has been around basically since forever, and they have a really nice site that provides a lot of options and info for users via the many sections on their site. As an example; if you're looking for other players to team up with for a session, or a more permanent group to team up with, you should be able to find plenty via the Broadcast tab in the Forum section, and if you feel like setting up an event for yourself and others, you can do so via the Community --> Community Server selection. For this, DayZTV have also been helpful for users by setting up a Discord server where you can reach other players. What is also relly nice about DayZTV is that via the Live section you will find a selection of live Twitch streams from users playing DayZ, and outside of that, there is a boatload of helpful info for users stowed away under other sections such as Guides for example. We can only imagine how much work and effort it must take to run and develop the site, and we really appreciate the massive support that DayZTV has provided for so long in regards to promoting DayZ as well as DayZ related news while it is in development! As always, in case you are part of a community that you would like to see highlighted, or if you are a contect creator looking to share your stories and footage, just send us some info at support@dayz.com and we'll be happy to have a look!

Yes, we are still working on destroying the last few remaining issues preventing us from pushing 0.61 to experimental. As is usual, I'm going to walk you all through what those issues are in this Status Report so you're aware of what they are, and what it is that is keeping 0.61 from hitting the experimental servers. Once we go over those, I'm going to spend some time discussing points made over on our forums in regards to status reports, and feature set backlog so as to address some discussion I've read on the community side regarding those. In addition to that, Peter will spend some time sharing his excitement for future changes to the animation system, player controller, user actions, and so forth, Miroslav will discuss some of his teams current tasks, and Viktor will elaborate on some of the work the animation team is focused on for builds past 0.61. As of this morning, we're looking at approximately 11 open must fix issues, are regression testing 5 other issues that have been flagged as resolved by the developers assigned to the issue(s). Taking a look at what exactly that means: Current Must Fix Open Issues: Client crash after exiting title Player SFX sounds near silent Players can become severely out of sync Some firearms not firing on first mouse click Player position stuttering under 100+ ms network conditions Some lighting conditions not casting proper shadows Known 0.60 item duplication methods Magazine capacity issues New methods for players swimming in ground UI Zeroing not present Glock muzzle flash / SFX not present for other players Obviously some of these issues are far more critical than others, and some are new. Over the last few weeks we've been fairly aggressive with some of our bug bash sessions, and while it is most definitely frustrating for all of us - I'm very pleased with the fact we've been able to track down some of these critical issues. For example, the players out of sync issue (#3 on the above list) took a good deal of time to find a proper repro on, but the behavior it caused makes for a total break down of network messaging between two players. Causing some animations, and sounds caused by other players to not show up properly for several minutes. (Think gunshots, or player position) which will only lead to incredibly frustrating gameplay and is something I absolutely do not want to see on the Steam branches. Tackling known methods for duplication, animation glitching, and so on are also absolutely critical to get resolved - and left unchecked will do damage to both the economy, and player experience in the time between new builds being pushed to Steam. In addition to those, the issues we're currently regression testing include issues with player temperatures / modifiers, player sounds, and several serious client crashes. The player temperature issue is something I've spent a good deal of time focusing on, and discussing with Peter's design team on. As I feel that both resolving the issue present on 0.60 stable for hyperthermia, and pushing towards providing players on 0.61 an actual environmental risk (more towards hypothermia being a risk when wet and or dealing with severe cold and improper protection against those elements) is absolutely important. While those above issues are regression tested, and fixed by the appropriate developers, Peter and I have also gone over behaviours of per player dynamic spawning, and what the technology of the Central Economy will allow us - and have pushed for changes in that area to switch to a more area based trigger rather than per player, to reduce player ability to try and meta game the system. Recently I've been pushing myself to have more of a presence on our official forums, and engage actively in discussion on the project, gameplay, mechanics and so on with the users over there. As well as sharing experiences and details of the ongoing 0.61 internal testing. I hope at the very least more of you will read the posts over there, if not actually register and participate. Speaking of the forums, I want to revisit some key points I've made over the last few months in the \"A Few Thoughts On\" posts. Specifically, in regards to Status Reports, and Pending Feature/Content updates. As many of you may recall, or have noticed - we made changes to how we communicate \"new things\" in the Status Reports. From the old method of talking about whats to come in DayZ as soon as we've settled on a design, or may have a model ready, to specifically focusing on what is upcoming in the very next build to be pushed to Steam. I know some of you haven't necessarily enjoyed this change, but I honestly feel it is a much safer approach to managing hype, and not giving people false hope on how soon they might see something in game. Now, I do feel there is however some compromise on our part that can be made - which is why I'd like to compile a 1.0 feature set we can keep on our forums that will give people an idea of exactly what to expect of the final version (within a margin for error of course), and I hope this will help reduce some of the confusion. I'll need to sit down with Eugen, and the leads responsible for each department before publishing this, but I hope it will serve to answer some of the questions I've seen out there. Which brings me to my next point. Just because Status Reports are not touching on a major technology change, or new pending feature set does not mean it is not being worked on. As I mentioned above, we focus the Status Reports on progress towards the next major build to be pushed to Steam - and does not cover changes that are slated for builds to be pushed to Steam past that. A perfect example would be the new animation system, player controller, and user actions. The developers responsible for this have been working their fingers to the bone day in and day out, and we *will* be talking about it and showing off examples once we reach the point in which we are focusing on those updates for the next major build update for Steam. In addition to that, we have a *significant* content and feature backlog that is dependant on these systems - and as Peter will discuss below, we are at a point in which it does not make much sense to create systems, or address non game breaking issues in the old SQF script and hierarchy. I, and the rest of the team are all very aware of how frustrating this might be for many of you. We're all right there with you, but the work we are doing and have been doing this year represents *massive* changes and the introduction of the major key points for DayZ's new Enfusion engine. We're not going anywhere. The developers who work on DayZ are some of the most passionate, dedicated, and hard working folks I've ever had the pleasure of working with. We love this game, we love the stories you all create in the world of Chernarus, and I believe I speak for all of us when I say we have the most absolute faith that all of our hard work is going to make DayZ a game that is truly worthy of the dedication and love you have all shown it throughout the trials and hardships of public development. We might not always agree - all of you that make up the DayZ community, and I - but I don't think I could ask for more amazing, and dedicated fans for the project - and I wouldn't trade you all for the world. Truly, thank you for being there with us through the ups and downs. I can not wait for the adventures we will all have together. 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Ready for experimental branch testing - no current issues preventing this at this time. Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Technology successfully merged into DayZ branch. Ready for further testing on experimental branch. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. All current firearms configured - Audio team is now focused on addressing must fix issues for 0.61 Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Testing complete on initial implementation, Programming team is now making the requested changes described above to area triggers in order to provide the Design team with the requested functionality. Predators (Wolves) Internal Testing is very optimistic, several fixes to behavior have been merged over - and programmers are focused on addressing several server crash issues potentially tied to the predator AI. Dynamic Shadows Last few issues related to proper shadow projection are being focused on now, once these are resolved we should be ready on this specific feature. Network Synchronization Improvements The gameplay programming team is currently focused on addressing the previously mentioned issues with 100+ MS connections having jittery gameplay in some situations, as well as tracking the recently discovered repro steps for causing player to player sync to fail. Once these issues are resolved, we should be good to go. New Server Browser Functionally this is ready, however while the must fix issues are addressed, several small UI changes have been made to make the new server browser easy to use and understand. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-28-sept-2016",

After that we'll talk about some of the current top issues we are working on in prep for 0.61 experimental, and lastly we have a few new things on our Trello for you all. Fair warning - text wise this is a brief status report - but we tried to also push in some stuff that is being worked on, if not specifically for 0.61. 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Ready for experimental branch testing - no current issues preventing this at this time. Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Technology successfully merged into DayZ branch. Ready for further testing on experimental branch. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. All current firearms configured - Audio team is working on completing SFX for future firearms. In addition, this week several issues were encountered with impact noises on some weapons not operating properly, this issue is being addressed by the audio team as of the time of this report. Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Gameplay Programmers are still working on fully plugging in animal spawns to this system. While this is ongoing, the design and gameplay programming teams have been discussing ways to evenly distribute dynamic spawns across all vilages and points of interest, and ways to provide a compelling experience without impacting the server performance budget during the lifetime of the server. Predators (Wolves) Still cautiously optimistic here. However at this point it is looking like we *will* be testing wolves on some of the initial 0.61 experimental pushes to see if they behave and operate as expected in a live environment. Beyond our defined milestone goals, we have several additional changes that are looking to be rolled into 0.61, lets take a quick look at those right now. Dynamic Shadows Programmers from the Enfusion engine team have been working to resolve the last remaining issues encountered in internal testing with this. As of the current build in internal testing right now we still have a few small issues with light in some edge cases ignoring geometry, however this is looking really good for 0.61 experimental. Below you'll see an example of how this is looking right now, both in the Status Report and on our Trello. Network Synchronization Improvements As Miroslav, our Lead Gameplay Programmer discussed in a previous Status Report - he has been working hard on improving our client/server synchronization in an effort to improve quality-of-life and reduce frustrating deaths and poor gameplay experiences due to client/server disagreements. Things are looking very, very promising. That said, as tends to happen in development, internal testing has encountered several issues that can potentially cause unexpected changes to player position and movement under less than ideal network conditions. As everyone that plays DayZ has different connection conditions, and communities are spread across the globe, ensuring that gameplay and network synchronization works properly under all reasonable pings and connection speeds is critical. So that said, the gameplay programming team and the quality assurance teams are working hand in hand to resolve this issue for 0.61 experimental. New Server Browser Many players have reported large frame drops and client unresponsiveness in our legacy server browser (currently used in 0.60 stable branch), and due to that we have pushed up the merge of our new server browser to 0.61 in an attempt to address this sooner, rather than later. Keep in mind however, this is only the first iteration of this and some functionality will not be present or working entirely. However, functionality we fully expect the first iteration to be 1:1 with the current 0.60 server browser. Currently, our QA Lead Ondrej (Andy) is tracking 16 must-fix bugs for 0.61, including but not limited to: Player Sounds significantly quieter than environment and AI Client crash after exiting Player position hitching under less than ideal network conditions (150+ms) Animation Issues related to swimming Certain walls and objects not displaying shadows at certain angles Characters getting stuck when climbing ladders Player to Player magazine capacity synchronization Item Duplication Exploit (Thanks to the new security feedback form!) Client crash related to connecting to server Characters stuck in weapon raised pose in certain conditions We've updated our Trello with some new progress shots from the art team, and a preview video of the current status of dynamic shadows (see below!) http://i.imgur.com/ScSP0j5.jpg - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Community Spotlight Thanks again for all the bug reports we've received from you all so far! Since noone likes a cheater, don't be shy to also report those security related issues that you come across. As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we have a new task type in our feedback tracker which is specifically set up so that you can safely and securely report sensitive issues in DayZ. For more info on that, please have a look at the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/dayz-security-issue-report Also, for those of you that have been having trouble finding supplies in Chernarus as of late, there is help to be found. MadMcardle has made a small guide on how you can go about getting food in 0.60: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP83toJSzfo On top of that; MadMcardle also has a pretty neat playlist containing useful guides for crafting different items such as the fireplace, the spear, and the improvised fishing rod for example. All good help for those that like to try and create their own gear and such: DayZ Crafting Guide Well done, sir! Header image credit: JøhnnY - SMoss / Community Manager",

Beyond our defined milestone goals, we have several additional changes that are looking to be rolled into 0.61, lets take a quick look at those right now. Dynamic Shadows Programmers from the Enfusion engine team have been working to resolve the last remaining issues encountered in internal testing with this. As of the current build in internal testing right now we still have a few small issues with light in some edge cases ignoring geometry, however this is looking really good for 0.61 experimental. Below you'll see an example of how this is looking right now, both in the Status Report and on our Trello. Network Synchronization Improvements As Miroslav, our Lead Gameplay Programmer discussed in a previous Status Report - he has been working hard on improving our client/server synchronization in an effort to improve quality-of-life and reduce frustrating deaths and poor gameplay experiences due to client/server disagreements. Things are looking very, very promising. That said, as tends to happen in development, internal testing has encountered several issues that can potentially cause unexpected changes to player position and movement under less than ideal network conditions. As everyone that plays DayZ has different connection conditions, and communities are spread across the globe, ensuring that gameplay and network synchronization works properly under all reasonable pings and connection speeds is critical. So that said, the gameplay programming team and the quality assurance teams are working hand in hand to resolve this issue for 0.61 experimental. New Server Browser Many players have reported large frame drops and client unresponsiveness in our legacy server browser (currently used in 0.60 stable branch), and due to that we have pushed up the merge of our new server browser to 0.61 in an attempt to address this sooner, rather than later. Keep in mind however, this is only the first iteration of this and some functionality will not be present or working entirely. However, functionality we fully expect the first iteration to be 1:1 with the current 0.60 server browser. Currently, our QA Lead Ondrej (Andy) is tracking 16 must-fix bugs for 0.61, including but not limited to: Player Sounds significantly quieter than environment and AI Client crash after exiting Player position hitching under less than ideal network conditions (150+ms) Animation Issues related to swimming Certain walls and objects not displaying shadows at certain angles Characters getting stuck when climbing ladders Player to Player magazine capacity synchronization Item Duplication Exploit (Thanks to the new security feedback form!) Client crash related to connecting to server Characters stuck in weapon raised pose in certain conditions We've updated our Trello with some new progress shots from the art team, and a preview video of the current status of dynamic shadows (see below!) http://i.imgur.com/ScSP0j5.jpg - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Community Spotlight Thanks again for all the bug reports we've received from you all so far! Since noone likes a cheater, don't be shy to also report those security related issues that you come across. As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we have a new task type in our feedback tracker which is specifically set up so that you can safely and securely report sensitive issues in DayZ. For more info on that, please have a look at the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/dayz-security-issue-report Also, for those of you that have been having trouble finding supplies in Chernarus as of late, there is help to be found. MadMcardle has made a small guide on how you can go about getting food in 0.60: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP83toJSzfo On top of that; MadMcardle also has a pretty neat playlist containing useful guides for crafting different items such as the fireplace, the spear, and the improvised fishing rod for example. All good help for those that like to try and create their own gear and such: DayZ Crafting Guide Well done, sir! Header image credit: JøhnnY - SMoss / Community Manager",

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/FJsPp0l.jpg Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Mirek Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Over the last two weeks the team has been hard at work tackling bugs and final missing functionality on intended .61 milestone goals. Not to mention a few additional improvements not listed on the milestone goals, such as dynamic shadows, network sync improvements, and expanded improvements in the audio technology side of Enfusion. The test / fix / regression process between when a build is feature ready for experimental and functionally ready for experimental can be a bit of a grind here in the office (especially when you consider the branching that occurs so that the stable candidate can be worked on, while the rest of the team continues work on .62 and forward), but as always I'm proud to say the team has been relentless. To give you an example, just over the last week the QA, Programming, and Design teams have squashed bugs such as: Client freeze on server connection Isolating remaining issues with new synchronization system Audio configuration issues w/ interior and exterior surfaces Infected hit detection issues Reload / Chambering not occurring when player initiates animation Chambered ammo not being depleted when firing (ooh boy that one is nasty!) Dynamic shadows not behaving properly with certain geometry within Chernarus Client side control failures under certain animation states (clients locked into one direction after jumping off of certain terrain) NavMesh problems with Infected (ignoring some structure geometry) Character gear loss under certain crafting, and connection scenarios Client crashes when using Exp Debug window Dynamic events not showing on client side Virtual Machine exception related to containers Infected being blocked by collision with corpses Server crash caused by animal behaviour Server delay registering clients after initial connection This is just a brief look at some of the issues tackled over the last week - and does not include issues the team is still working on. Countless issues are tackled before the player even sees the next testable build - and I hope this gives you all at least a small example of the work that goes into getting a build to experimental. Unfortunately the reality of development is its never quite as easy as just making the desired functionality, and pushing it to the experimental branch. Past that - Miroslav will be talking to you guys this week about exactly what he hopes to see from the upcoming improvements to network synchronization, and while I might have a bit more caution to my optimism I can safely say I am excited to see how it will behave under a larger testing pool. Keep in mind as well, he specifically calls out that there is a high chance the initial experimental builds for .61 won't be spawning vehicles - as he and his team are currently working on the synchronization improvements for them specifically. Looking at the .61 milestone goals for this Status Report: 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Ready for experimental branch testing - no current issues preventing this at this time. Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Technology successfully merged into DayZ branch. Ready for further testing on experimental branch. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. All current firearms configured - Audio team is working on completing SFX for future firearms, as well as working with design and programming team to tackle configuration, and surface effect issues as they pop up in QA. Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Programming team is currently working on plugging animal spawning into this system. Once this is functioning properly they will continue working on adding the additional functionality of per-player impact on the quantity inside a defined area. Predators (Wolves) We're cautiously optimistic here. While we're seeing improvements on our end, there is still a high chance this milestone goal will be pushed to a future build. Network synchronization improvements could make this viable for .61. Testing, and regression will give us a better idea. Past the milestone goals for .61, as you all know we have several improvements we're aiming to also be present for that build. Including but not limited to: Experimental Branch Debug Monitor Network Synchronization Improvements Dynamic Shadows And for those who don't keep an eye on our development board - we've pushed a few updates there to give you an idea of what some of this can be expected to look like: http://i.imgur.com/iwJS0wT.jpg Lastly, I completely understand the frustration many of you may feel in the lull between build publishes to experimental, and stable branch. There is a saying that goes around the community that after two months of a build being available, it starts to get long in the tooth and the community is eager for the next, and this is entirely true. However, it is not just the community - we (the developers) are just as eager as all of you out there playing, and participating in DayZ's development, as hard as that may seem to believe. As we move closer to beta, the builds we push out are less about initial prototyping and more about large changes to DayZ's engine. Enfusion is a massive change for us on so many levels, and it is because of that that these builds seem to take longer to push out. We're all massively grateful for those of you who continue to ride through the storm with us, and help to shape the final product that DayZ will become. I'm personally very excited to jump into .61 experimental when it goes live, and start a new series of adventures in Chernarus. Brian Hicks / Creative Director Dev Update/Mirek As we are more and more close to 0.61 experimental, we're mostly stabilizing the build (catching crashes, tweaking character selection from main menu and new infected/animal spawner). But there will be also one big thing we would like to enable in 0.61 experimental which Brian mentioned in last status report a bit. We were reworking major part of network code and completely changed synchronization of player controlled entities, which should deal with position desynchronization. This means that there won't be any weird deaths (on stairs, near the edges on the roof, etc.), character won't be blocked somewhere else on server side (infected or other players won't hit you from big distance and if player is inside building, he won't be blocked outside), game should behave much better with worse network condition and it should deal with a lot of issues which were present in the game since EA release. I have to admit that these changes aren't applied on vehicles yet, so vehicles won't probably spawn in first iterations of experimental builds, but once we will enable them for vehicles, they should fix most issues like lagging and freezing, when vehicle is in proximity of another vehicle. Also, please don't expect everything will be amazing, we're still have some animation issues and a couple of other bugs, especially connected to ladder movement and it's very likely that more will appear after experimental release. It's even possible that if a lot of issues appear, network changes won't hit stable and will be postponed to 0.62, because we don't want to block 0.61 stable release for too long. Miroslav Maněna / Lead Gameplay Programmer Community Spotlight Kind of like the last time around, we'll see if we can help players who are looking to join a community which is not necessarily english speaking. We were approached by Dopeyferes who asked if we would have time to look at a couple of his videos as well as showcase his channel, and of course, we were more than happy to do so. http://i.imgur.com/hlhEuB7.jpg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUu3ubX61pA Outside of having really nice videos of DayZ on his channel, he is also part of a larger hispanic community that plays DayZ among other titles. So, if you are looking for a spanish speaking community, I'm quite sure that he'll be able to help you out if you contact him via his Facebook page, or if you for example join the Steam Group that he is a member of. Of course, Dopeyferes also has a Twitter account where you can follow his updates and he streams from his Twitch account as well. We do have yet another community lined up for the next status report, but in case you are part of one that you would like to see highlighted, just send some info to support@dayz.com and we'll be happy to have a look. - SMoss / Community Manager",

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/LGGzgbg.jpg Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, We don't have too much new and exciting or flashy news for this Status Report, and most of the usual SR participants are either attending Gamescom or on holiday. However, we do have updates on the progress of development towards .61 experimental, and thus Stable. In addition I'll go over the recent .61 Dev Log video that hit our Youtube channel yesterday, talk a bit about some of what was featured in it - and close with a few comments on the economy (of course - its not a Status Report without talking about the CLE). 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Functional testing is complete internally - just waiting to push it to experimental and see if it breaks! Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Technology successfully merged into DayZ branch. Ready for further testing on experimental branch. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. Down to three firearms left to be configured and mastered - effectively ready for larger testing pool on experimental branch. Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Bulk spawning in areas defined through the zone generation tool is done. As demonstrated at the end of the last Dev Log video for .61. Work is still continuing on plugging in animal spawning to this system as well. Per-player infected spawning configuration (eg: 1 player entering a village can spawn X number, additional players spawn more) and support is being worked on by gameplay programming team. Predators (Wolves) Some strong progress has been made in regards to making wolves sync and move better in multiplayer - there are still several glaring issues with animation, and position syncronization up close that just don't make them very rewarding in their current state. That said, the programmers responsible for this area have several potential positive areas they are working on to improve this. As it sits right now, they are not functionally ready for a larger testing base. That said - we will be looking very seriously at the possibility of branching all the other main milestone goals off for testing on experimental branch while work continues on wolves. We'll keep people up to date on this via the official forums as this moves forward. Past the stated milestone goals for .61 - several other fantastic improvements have been made internally during the development of .61 build. As you may have seen in the latest Dev Log video - dynamic shadows coming from point source lights are finally a thing for us. We're currently tracking down several issues with this new functionality, but just having it functioning at a base level has been a huge source of excitement in the office. Bohemia Interactive engines have always had amazing strengths, but like any technology - they have their short comings. The dreaded \"light going through walls\" is one of the oldest, and for DayZ players (Flashlights going through buildings and telling everyone where you are at night!) one of the most irritating. http://i.imgur.com/L4FIVcK.jpg In addition to this - Our gameplay programming team, led by Mirek Manena has made some strong improvements tackling desync of player position within DayZ. Now, keep in mind poor network conditions, and poor server performance can still cause bad behavior here - but addressing more fluid handling of this at a server level has been something that has been worked on, iterated on, and thought about a lot internally here. We're excited to see how the latest changes will shape up when under heavy player load - as a smooth experience and removing those pesky random leg breaks and inability to pick up items at times is pretty dang important for us. As mentioned, we recently uploaded a new .61 Dev Log video to the official DayZ Dev Team youtube channel. In it we show some work in progress examples of assault rifles, and some pistols using the new audio technology DayZ now has thanks to cooperation from the fantastic Arma dev team. As well as some examples of general group dynamic infected spawning in both Vybor, and Elektro. Now, our intended functionality with dynamic spawning of infected is to allow each player entering the area to cause more, and more infected to spawn - thus potentially creating a very large threat in the presence of a large amount of players. (Think of the infected mentality as always moving towards something that gets their attention.) In addition to allowing for a \"restock\" or \"respawn\" timer - giving players the ability to potentially temporarily clean an area out and make it safe. Currently, we're not quite there - but we do have general dynamic spawning of infected when any player enters an area. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgBoBVRKA8 Lastly - in regards to the Central Economy. I've kept an eye on forum posts, youtube videos, and livestreams and I've noticed some folks starting to question the availability of food. The slow reduction of non-perishable food is entirely intended. Peter and myself have been working with the design team to slowly reduce the amount of available non-perishable food every two or three days to a level that we're somewhat comfortable with. Keep in mind, finding supplies like that shouldn't be too easy - players need to be at a position where considering picking berries and apples, killing animals, planting crops, or harvesting meat through... other methods.. is viable.

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/LGGzgbg.jpg Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, We don't have too much new and exciting or flashy news for this Status Report, and most of the usual SR participants are either attending Gamescom or on holiday. However, we do have updates on the progress of development towards .61 experimental, and thus Stable. In addition I'll go over the recent .61 Dev Log video that hit our Youtube channel yesterday, talk a bit about some of what was featured in it - and close with a few comments on the economy (of course - its not a Status Report without talking about the CLE). 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue Functional testing is complete internally - just waiting to push it to experimental and see if it breaks! Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update. Technology successfully merged into DayZ branch. Ready for further testing on experimental branch. Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology. Down to three firearms left to be configured and mastered - effectively ready for larger testing pool on experimental branch. Dynamic Spawning of Infected. Bulk spawning in areas defined through the zone generation tool is done. As demonstrated at the end of the last Dev Log video for .61. Work is still continuing on plugging in animal spawning to this system as well. Per-player infected spawning configuration (eg: 1 player entering a village can spawn X number, additional players spawn more) and support is being worked on by gameplay programming team. Predators (Wolves) Some strong progress has been made in regards to making wolves sync and move better in multiplayer - there are still several glaring issues with animation, and position syncronization up close that just don't make them very rewarding in their current state. That said, the programmers responsible for this area have several potential positive areas they are working on to improve this. As it sits right now, they are not functionally ready for a larger testing base. That said - we will be looking very seriously at the possibility of branching all the other main milestone goals off for testing on experimental branch while work continues on wolves. We'll keep people up to date on this via the official forums as this moves forward. Past the stated milestone goals for .61 - several other fantastic improvements have been made internally during the development of .61 build. As you may have seen in the latest Dev Log video - dynamic shadows coming from point source lights are finally a thing for us. We're currently tracking down several issues with this new functionality, but just having it functioning at a base level has been a huge source of excitement in the office. Bohemia Interactive engines have always had amazing strengths, but like any technology - they have their short comings. The dreaded \"light going through walls\" is one of the oldest, and for DayZ players (Flashlights going through buildings and telling everyone where you are at night!) one of the most irritating. http://i.imgur.com/L4FIVcK.jpg In addition to this - Our gameplay programming team, led by Mirek Manena has made some strong improvements tackling desync of player position within DayZ. Now, keep in mind poor network conditions, and poor server performance can still cause bad behavior here - but addressing more fluid handling of this at a server level has been something that has been worked on, iterated on, and thought about a lot internally here. We're excited to see how the latest changes will shape up when under heavy player load - as a smooth experience and removing those pesky random leg breaks and inability to pick up items at times is pretty dang important for us. As mentioned, we recently uploaded a new .61 Dev Log video to the official DayZ Dev Team youtube channel. In it we show some work in progress examples of assault rifles, and some pistols using the new audio technology DayZ now has thanks to cooperation from the fantastic Arma dev team. As well as some examples of general group dynamic infected spawning in both Vybor, and Elektro. Now, our intended functionality with dynamic spawning of infected is to allow each player entering the area to cause more, and more infected to spawn - thus potentially creating a very large threat in the presence of a large amount of players. (Think of the infected mentality as always moving towards something that gets their attention.) In addition to allowing for a \"restock\" or \"respawn\" timer - giving players the ability to potentially temporarily clean an area out and make it safe. Currently, we're not quite there - but we do have general dynamic spawning of infected when any player enters an area. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgBoBVRKA8 Lastly - in regards to the Central Economy. I've kept an eye on forum posts, youtube videos, and livestreams and I've noticed some folks starting to question the availability of food.

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/vQRkGT8.jpg Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Since the last Status Report we've been mostly focused on .61 - and getting it ready for experimental. That said, there are a few things I'd like to cover before we talk about the current status of each of the .61 milestone goals. Over the last two weeks, Peter and I have spent a good amount of time discussing two areas of DayZ. Dynamic changes to the economy, and the external DayZ launcher. Peter will be talking about the launcher in his portion of this status report, so I'll talk a bit about the dynamic changes to the economy. The current iteration of the central loot economy allows for dynamic (no patch required) updating of every item that spawns in DayZ. This means it includes: The minimum, and nominal operating values of each item. The frequency it can respawn. The region of Chernarus it can spawn in. In the case of items such as magazines, and piles of ammo - it can dictate the minimum and maximum ranges for how much of that items capacity it spawns with. The reason I bring this up is because the design team routinely will adjust these levels based upon data and behaviour observed on stable branch, and these changes can be effective within an hour of the change occurring. Over the last few weeks quite a few adjustments have been made on everything from the availability of certain ammo types, to the available quantity of non perishable canned goods. Thus, it makes it even more valuable for those observing bugs or general issues with this system to be specific in their reports on the feedback tracker. Make sure to detail exactly what you observed, when you observed it, and most important - what server it occurred on. To give you an example of exactly how important this data is, we've been trying internally to track down behaviour in regards to certain items spawning in piles (specifically in this case firearms) despite the fact that the restock timer should prevent such behaviour. It has been a nasty issue that has seemed to occur on the stable branch significantly easier than we have been able to reproduce it internally. That said, thanks to several dedicated feedback tracker users - we were able to isolate the issue on stable branch - and have identified the cause of it. (Much to the satisfaction of both Peter and I) We'll now be able to resolve the issue discovered with .61. In addition to this, today the design team will be introducing changes to firearm and ammunition tiering and nominal values. Like all things, we'll need to wait and observe over the coming week to see the impact as existing availability within the economy (on players, in camps) can and will impact how this behaves. As these changes become effective in the stable branch wide economy, it is vital that if you notice an issue, you file a feedback tracker issue with as much information as possible. Enough about the economy though - lets take a look at where we are with .61 development goals: 0.61 Milestone Goals: Server Login Queue: Feature implemented, system under review with internal QA teams. Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update: Tech implemented fully into DayZ. Existing sounds and configs from legacy system functioning properly. (Backwards compatibility with legacy sound technology). Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology: 21 weapons ready, work continues on remaining firearms. Youtube channel dev log preview upcoming! SKS Sporter Trumpet Repeater AKM Steyr FAL SVD MP5K 1911 CR75 Derringer Flaregun FNX Glock 19 Longhorn Magnum Amphibia P1 Makarov Red 9 Dynamic Spawning of Infected: Feature implemented into internal branch. QA teams are doing initial passes and providing programmers with initial issues. Predators (Wolves) The team are currently working on several key issues with predators (wolves). Specifically being addressed currently are: Issues with navigation in urban / dense areas. Overall physics related issues. Damage application against non player targets. AI Targeting priority. It's no secret that as far as DayZ and .61 goals go, predator AI is a big addition to gameplay, and clearly the largest at risk area for milestone goal slippage. That said, we're still very confident in our progress on the feature and the pace at which it is moving forward. We'll continue to update you all as to the status of this milestone goal with Status Reports. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director For the full status report, please use the following link: http://forums.dayz.com/topic/234802-status-report-02-aug-2016",

        "contents": "Every game is ambitious. It s not easy to turn a beautiful idea into a finished, playable game as developers have said time and again, sometimes it feels almost impossible. As miraculous as finishing any game might be, not all games are created equal. Some stretch the boundaries of technology to their breaking point. Others take a leap into the unknown with new design schools, often so effectively that years later, it s hard to remember them ever having to be invented. Think, for example, of Monkey Island s Three Trials structure, as used by almost every adventure afterwards. Or its sequel s Four Map Pieces , as later picked up by BioWare. And sometimes, both art and science combine to push the envelope and we get something truly, impossibly special. Here are our picks for the top 20 ignoring the very early games that had to prove computers could handle gaming at all. For more on some of the most monumental games ever to grace the PC, check out our feature on the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/most-important-pc-games/\">most important PC games</a>. King&apos;s Quest (1983) For the longest time, adventure games were where people looked to see the latest innovations. King s Quest set that bar early on, jumping from simple text and pictures to 3D environments, huge worlds, and a fairytale land of mystery to both wander and wonder at. Admittedly, the last part was helped by some dreadful puzzles. King s Quest was originally commissioned by IBM as the showpiece for its long-forgotten PCJr system, but the series would go on to demonstrate just about every major technological advancement for the mainstream: ADLIB sound, VGA graphics, full speech, and high resolution. 3D didn t work out so well, but until that point, King s Quest was where many players went to get their glimpse of the ever-advancing future. Commander Keen (1990) If you want to experience pure hell, try the average 80s PC platform game. Long before making Doom, the team that would be id Software wanted to prove that the PC could handle experiences that played as smoothly as dedicated consoles. Commander Keen wasn t just a fluid experience by the standards of the time, but a fast one, with pogo-jumping, shooting and big levels to explore. Looking back, it s hard to appreciate what a development it was, but we re talking an era where games like the original Duke Nukem (or Nukum either way, the one who wore a pink suit and watched Oprah) were constantly being held up as the PC s answer to Mario. Commander Keen didn t qualify either, but it paved the way for many sequels and the formation of id itself. A bit of bonus ambition: before making Keen, id tried to convince Nintendo to let it port Super Mario Bros. 3 to the PC by building a working demo (in their off hours in a single week, no less). Nintendo said no thanks, but <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/148909578\">you can see footage of the demo here</a>. Maniac Mansion (1987) If you made a game like Maniac Mansion right now, people would still rightly call it ambitious. A choice of seven characters, each with their own skills. A non-linear adventure with five different endings depending on choices and characters. Real time elements, like ringing the doorbell and having a character come downstairs to check on it. Puzzles involving multiple characters in different rooms of the house or simply the option to do things like put a kid in an empty swimming pool and then fill it back up. And on top of all of this, Maniac Mansion brought the world the SCUMM system (Script Creation Utility For Maniac Mansion) that would define about half the adventure game market for the next decade. All of this, in 1987. Few adventures have ever done so much. Ultima Underworld (1993) Like most of the games on this list, Ultima Underworld is a fusion between ambitious technology and ambitious design the design side specifically being to take one single dungeon and try to breathe life into it. To add nuance to its different races, there to be talked to instead of just beaten up. The Stygian Abyss wasn t just a battlefield. It was a fallen community. A place to live in. The experience of being thrown into a dungeon and just expected to survive. What really sold it though, if your PC could run it, was the technology. Before even Wolfenstein 3D, Ultima Underworld offered a full 3D environment complete with slopes, lighting effects and more, in a bit of technology that could only have been more impressive if well, the viewing window had been a bit bigger. Underworld 2 greatly increased the scope of the game, visiting other worlds and making it a bit easier to see, but what the first one managed remains a technological victory worthy of any heroic age. Ultima VII: The Black Gate (1993) Get used to seeing the word Ultima. Ultima VII came out in 1993, and still games like Divinity: Original Sin measure themselves against its success. Its biggest success was creating a living world, where peasants went home at night, weather blasted the world, your companions had to be fed, and, yes, where you could get some flour and water, mix it into dough, stick it in an oven, and get your own deliciously crispy bread. On top of this was an incredibly mature story that continued the series love of more advanced storytelling than most games of the era (previous ones having tackled racism, the perversion of good, and the quest for a hero worth being called one) with a complex tale of good intentions subverted by an otherworldly being of pure, but incredibly smug malevolence. Ultima Online (1997) Last time! Where Ultima VII brought a living world to single-player RPGs, Ultima Online brought it to multiplayer. It wasn t the first MUD or MMO, but most of them followed the Diku model popularised by Everquest: go forth, slay. Ultima Online wanted to create an actual world, where players would gather resources, craft houses, become shopkeepers and more, with hero just one of the many careers available. It wasn t without its problems, the first of them being the discovery that given a world to explore and exploit, players will typically turn it into a survival of the fittest Hell. But, its scope, its potential, and the joy of it when it worked created an epic experience that s still running today, and stories like <a href=\"http://massivelyop.com/2015/10/03/the-game-archaeologist-the-assassination-of-lord-british/\">the assassination of Lord British</a> that will never cease to amuse. The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall (1996) The second of the Elder Scrolls games asked one hell of a question: could you make a world with over 750,000 characters and a map the size of Britain actually feel like a world? We re putting this one here instead of Elite, partly to ring the changes, but mostly because few procedural games have pulled it off so well enough political relationships, guilds, interesting stuff to discover, and cool mechanics like being able to get turned into a werewolf or vampire. It s not that difficult to create raw space. Daggerfall s own predecessor Arena offered even more. Its sequel, Morrowind, did what most games tend to, and hand-crafted a far smaller area in intricate detail. But for a moment with Daggerfall, we had a game that showed you could be epic, procedural and interesting, without simplifying everything down to the ASCII style of Rogue or putting all the impetus on the player to pretend that there was more going on behind the surface than was ever going to meet the eye. Duke Nukem 3D (1996) While another case of a game that s not aged all that well, Duke Nukem 3D was the game that took FPS action out of military bases and sewers and relocated it to city streets, cinemas, and other more realistic locations. That plus a complicated scripting system to blow them all up, clever tricks to fake a 3D engine (even though it was only 2.5, much like Doom) and endless imagination took Duke from being a moderate shareware star to the highest tiers of game characters. No wonder the world was willing to wait so long for Duke Nukem Forever. Even if it wasn t worth it, in the end. Outcast (1999) The PC has never really had its own Legend of Zelda. Action. Exploration. A whole new world to explore. Outcast is arguably the closest its come. A graphical powerhouse of a game that immediately impressed with its freedom, with the AI of its characters, with the glorious effects in everything from jumping into water, to your personal scanner rippling gridmarks across the scenery. There was only one problem. It was all done with voxels at a time when 3D cards were finally allowing for decent polygonal worlds, putting all the work on CPUs that couldn t handle it. If you could play it, Outcast was an unforgettable experience. Too bad for most people it was one that had to wait until the <a href=\"https://www.gog.com/game/outcast\">GOG version</a> that finally made it run, long after its prime. Grand Theft Auto 3 (2001) It s easy to dismiss the sheer effort that goes into creating a city. After all, we ve walked, run, driven and carjacked around so many. GTA 3 wasn t even the first, with racing games in particular having set the pace. But could you get out of the racing cars and ramble? Enjoy a pumping gangster soundtrack? Run around with automatic weapons and go on missions with a huge cast of crazy characters? Just sit back and listen to an hour of talk radio? Nope. GTA III was magic, and so many sequels on, it s still raising the bar for what virtual cities can and should be. Give or take a few terrible cock jokes, anyway. EVE Online (2003) Ultima Online intended to let players call the shots. It didn t quite work. With EVE Online however, CCP had the courage to actually let it happen, creating one of the most talked about online games of the last few years. Tales of empires at war, of con artistry on a scale that would make Count Lustig blink, the epic sagas of backstabbings and betrayals that no other game can match. CCP likes to describe EVE using the phrase EVE is Real , and while there may not be any starships flying distant galaxies under your favourite forum s command, they still have a point. Civilization (1991) All of human history in a single game? There s not much more to be said, really. As achievements go, the only bigger one would be making it one of the greatest games of all time. Not to cast aspersions on the likes of Elite for creating a universe in slightly fewer bytes than the average person would make in a toothpaste and <a href=\"http://peperami.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/products/original_picture_product_en_0.png\">peperami</a> footlong, but the thing about space is that it is mostly empty. Just saying. The world however, in as many ways as you can imagine? That s ambition, even if using it educationally does mostly teach people never, ever to mess with Gandhi. Deus Ex (2000) Real world. Real conspiracies. Where do we even begin? Deus Ex not only set out to create some of the most realistic real-world locations we d ever seen (not a tautology the games before hadn t exactly done a great job most of the time), but also turn them into nothing short of a psychopath s toolbox. Multiple paths and solutions. Characters who reacted to your decisions. Tiny decisions determining who lives and who dies. All wrapped in some of the best writing and wrapping the PC had known up to this point. There s a reason why so many years on, it s the original Deus Ex that still stands out as both one of the greatest games ever, and the template of a dream for future immersive simulators to study at the feet of as they try to surpass it. Dwarf Fortress (2006) Simulations don t get any deeper than this. Literally, or figuratively. Dwarf Fortress or to give it its full title, SLAVES TO ARMOK: GOOD OF BLOOD, CHAPTER II: DWARF FORTRESS is an ASCII gem best summed up by its creator saying in 2011 that we shouldn t expect version 1.0 for at least twenty years. That s what you get in a game so crazily detailed that a cat can go into a tavern, pick up spilled alcohol on its paws, wash itself off, and get drunk. This was never intended behaviour, just the sum of smaller sub-routines coming together and making their own reality. In retrospect, that twenty years to complete doesn t sound so much at all. Half-Life 2 (2004) In a way, Half-Life 2 s most ambitious part isn t even in the game. Valve had an idea for a new store, called Steam . You might have heard of it. Half-Life 2 was, if not its Trojan horse, then its vanguard. You wanted to play the best FPS ever made at the time? Then you got it through Steam. And that worked out pretty well. Even if you ignore Steam, Half-Life 2 reinvented the shooter with its focus on physics, with every chapter introducing new mechanics and new exciting concepts like the gravity gun or playing point-defense with turrets. It also created a continuous world like no other, putting the final nail into the coffin of games that didn t prize a sense of presence as well as place in their shooter campaigns. Much copied, but still rarely bettered, Half-Life 2 set out to be both the best shooter around, and its next great leap forwards. Planetside (2003) Some games just shouldn t be possible. Even knowing the technology that powers them, the epic battles of the Planetside series have always had a degree of magic to them. For the handful of players lucky enough to have a system and connection that could handle it, heading out into one of Planetside s huge battles is a defining moment in games. For the rest, it says a lot that it still felt just as impressive when Planetside 2 rolled along only a couple of years ago. 5v5? 12v12? That s all well and good. But an explosive, expanding, all-access battlefield where the war never stops? That s military action with a little sorcery mixed into the formula, even today. Spore (2008) It failed. Yes, we know. It failed. But this is ambitious games we re talking about, and few games shot higher than Spore. Leading a tiny organism through every stage of life. Constructing it using the surprisingly powerful and fun editor. Sending it out to meet other players aliens in a great throbbing galaxy full of freshly created life. That may have been the point where the charm ran out, but the open-ended action and procedural generation and early focus on user generated content that led up to that point still stands out as a technological, if not gaming success. Crysis (2007) \"But can it run Crysis?\" was a relevant joke among PC gamers for at least three years for good reason: well after 2007, Crytek's shooter could still bring CPUs and graphics cards to their knees. Crysis took Half-Life 2's early use of physics and applied it to a dense, free-roaming world. Being able to shoot a tree, watch it fall over, and then shoot the trunk into smaller pieces was revelatory players gladly gave up framerate in favor of insane graphics and physics processing. Cutting edge AI and the systems-driven sandbox gave Crysis the depth to match its insane graphics, and no shooter since has managed quite the same combination of wow and substance. DayZ (2012) From its beginnings as a popular mod, DayZ spawned one of the most popular genres in gaming today. The framework for this multiplayer zombie survival game was Arma 2, up until that point one of the most ambitious simulation games and a bastion for fidelity and scale on PC. DayZ built upon Arma 2 s ambition, borrowing and later adapting its 225 km2 terrain, Chernarus, which was created from satellite-modeled slices of the Czech Republic. The month that DayZ caught on, creator Dean Hall was already laying out incredible plans about features he wanted to add, as he told us in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/day-z-interview-how-zombies-arma-2-created-gamings-best-story-machine/3/\"> an interview </a>. Underground structures. Dog companions. Realistic disease systems. A couple months later <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/interview-the-standalone-future-of-dayz-and-what-it-means-for-players/\"> we were hearing about </a> destructible terrain and player cities. Part of Hall s stated approach was to experiment with big, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dayz-creator-dean-hall-hopes-he-implements-alot-of-bad-ideas/\"> bad </a> ideas, but the reality of implementing them quickly in Arma s Real Virtuality engine for DayZ proved to be a massive challenge. Outside of these early technical roadblocks, as a multiplayer game DayZ was uniquely trusting. The systems that DayZ inherited from Arma granted it some depth, and being dropped into a massive, hostile environment with no instruction empowered players to tell their own stories, often through surprising, weird interactions with other survivors. Our 2012 <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-mod-of-the-year-2012-dayz/\"> mod of the year </a> remains in Early Access after arriving on Steam as a standalone game on December 2013. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015) It s amazing to think that in just three games, CD Projekt Red has gone from unknown studio to absolute top-tier RPG developer. The Witcher 3 is their masterpiece, from the hand-crafted world to the sheer number of characters and plots. It s a game that excels on every level, from scripting subtle enough for a character to break off combat when they hear your name, to the global nature of some of the most amazing graphics and scenery in any PC game ever, and the sheer artistry of just about every major quest or aside. You never know what s coming next, from the teary humanity of the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-the-witcher-3s-best-quest-was-made/\">Bloody Baron s agonising storyline</a>, to a gaggle of Witchers drinking too much, dressing up in drag, and drunk-dialling wizards across the whole continent. Star Citizen (20XX?) No, it s not out yet. It doesn t matter. Chris Roberts play to create the ultimate space game already qualifies. Elite style action combined with a dedicated, AAA Wing Commander-style campaign starring Mark Hamill. First person action aboard ships. Deep space exploration. A persistent universe allowing for company, or the solitude of the stars. A crowd-funded budget of $117,259,371 and counting, with players happily putting down real money for in-game ships and unlocking features like pets and modular ship designs and new AI characters to scatter around on planetside environments. If it s not the greatest game ever, expect literal, physical riots. ",

Focus is on recapping the stuff shown at RTX 2016 covering .61 and what we can expect for it - but aside from that we have some updates on current Stable Branch hotfix, some new renders of work in progress animations for the first of our predator animals, wolves, and Peter talks to us about body temperature and how it impacts DayZ gameplay. Current Stable Branch Hotfix goals are: Known Server Crashes Item Duplication Methods Animation State Issues Tent Lifetime Refresh Spatial Orientation for Vehicles A couple key things to note on the above list: Tent Lifetime Refresh is currently not functioning as intended on stable branch, meaning you are only able to refresh the lifetime of placed tents by packing and unpacking them. Intended functionality on these is to match the current behavior of containers such as barrels, and backpacks - which refresh their lifetime whenever an item is moved inside the inventory of the container. In regards to Spatial Orientation for Vehicles - the hotfix we're working on here should resolve complaints of vehicles not persisting. As current stable branch behavior does not properly save the directional orientation of the vehicle on server restart, in some cases this can cause the vehicle to be destroyed and cleaned up. In addition, we've uploaded some animated gifs of .. oddly enough.. animations of the upcoming wolves to our Trello board. If you're into that sort of thing, go check it out! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzn7UIKivNY - Brian Hicks / Creative Director Dev Update/Peter With the release of DayZ 0.60 stable version there was a bit of misunderstanding regarding the body temperature mechanic and considering it currently as bugged since characters can reach hyperthermia state in a very short time which wasn't the case in the 0.59 version. I would like to point out to those who aren't aware of it, that the engine which DayZ runs upon is capable of marvelous things that aren't obvious at first sight. Trajectories of sun and moon (even it's phases), star positions, tide heights, complex weather forecasts with air temperature, wind, newly added fog and other game world subsystems directly depends on the time of the day, date and geographic coordinates configuration. While geographic coordinates is tied to the map itself and cannot be easily changed, date and time is exposed in the server configuration so admins can change it freely. Unfortunately, date and time is not separated in the configuration file and the easiest way is to set it to the system date and time of the server itself especially to get more variety in time of day across the servers, and as most servers aren't running in the past or in the future, that's where things like the body temperature mechanic which is connected to those settings can seem off, even if it behaves correctly - I bet most of you will be overheating and sweating while sprinting hundreds of meters in full gear, long clothes and with gloves, masks, vests and helmets on top of it all in summer weather with air temperature around 30°C. As DayZ is visually set in eternal autumn it makes sense that this mechanic is balanced to that time of year, where nights are actually cold and days can be anywhere from a bit warmer to quite chilly depending on the forecast, not to mention plenty of foggy and rainy days. Of course, it could be hard-balanced without taking weather and air temperature into consideration, however, it would be a step backwards considering that DayZ will be open to modding and there being possibilities for us to expect maps in different times of the year and geographic coordinates - jungles, deserts, mountains anyone? To allow more control over it we are going to tear apart date and time in the server config so the date is not affected when the system time is used by admins. In the meantime, there was an offset applied in the calculation of body temperature for the experimental version so it behaves more according to the visuals of an autumn environment instead of an actual summer date set in the server config file. Now is a good time to unveil a bit more regarding the temperature feature, even if it's obviously quite low on the priority list now. Many of you noticed there is heating up and cooling down of item temperatures already present in game. This can be used to affect the body temperature of your survivor as heat packs, and even improvised ones like cans heated up in fireplace embers, will raise the body temperature while cold items will lower it. We are going to add more purpose to handling temperatures by making food perishable, especially raw meat alongside with blood bags. With plenty of refrigerators in houses or at junkyards you will be able to store food and blood bags safely to keep their expiration under control after you connect the fridges to an electricity system. The addition of cooling box containers will help you to carry food and blood bags around in fresh condition and ready to use. Considering food as one of the most crucial things for survival and with lowering of the amount of non-perishable food in the world towards the end, it will lead to promoting interesting approaches to gameplay for both lone wolfs and groups alike, as it will offer short time solutions of immediate consumption balanced against long term solutions with incorporating electricity usage at barricaded houses, camps, and bases during the times of need. Stay cool... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer Community Spotlight Another couple of weeks have passed, and we have again received a good amount of bugs via the Feedback Tracker. Regularly, we still see quite a few reports on player characters having lost their gear, and we do have a set of repro steps for this bug: 1. Join a server. 2. Go to any M4 handguard laying on the ground. 3. Take M4 to your hands. 4. Swap handguards on your M4 with handguard on the ground via action menu or by drag-and-drop. 5. Relog. 6. Notice that the character is missing all the gear except for the M4. If you experience loss of gear in any way different than with the repro steps above, please do let us know: http://feedback.bistudio.com/ Of course, we also have a video to highlight. This time around it's a video made by: PolishedGuy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BaJFzBBD4 Also, in case you tend to find yourself a bit on your lonesome when roaming around Chernarus, BarelyInfected has a meeting event coming up on July 16 at 22:00 CEST.

Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Viktor Dev Update/Andrej Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, As I'm sure most of you already know - 0.60 build was moved to Stable branch last week during E3. It is but one step towards 1.0, but one that we were all excited to get into your hands. While the build has been enjoyed by over 400,000 people since hitting stable branch, we've been keeping our eye on issues present on the build - and have been working towards a hotfix for the most critical issues, while also moving forward on 0.61. Current top issues for a hotfix are: - AI Related Server Crash - Container Lifetime Refresh Issue - Known Duplication Methods - Vehicle Location/Position Persistence With those being worked on - the milestone goals for 0.60 have been achieved, and we can look forward towards our goals for 0.61. 0.60 Build Milestone Goals: - New Renderer: Implemented - Randomized Attachments & ItemsRandom: Implemented - New Reload Mechanics: Implemented - 60 Player-per-instance: Implemented 0.61 Milestone Goals: - Server Login Queue - Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update - Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology - Dynamic Spawning of Infected - Predators (Wolves) I'll be at RTX in Austin, Texas early next month to talk about 0.61 and show some early representations of some of the systems, as well as recap 0.60 and what was achieved there. For those not attending the show, we'll be recording the audio off the sound board - and will match it with the presentation media and upload to our Youtube channel. Lastly, we'll be experimenting with uploads to our DayZDevTeam YouTube channel at 4k on the new nVidia GTX 1080 card, so for those eager to see how that performs on 0.60 - keep an eye out for that. A massive thanks from all of us at the DayZ Dev Team to those participating in the Early Access period and especially to the 415,000 who have joined us in testing 0.60 over the last two weeks. ​- Brian Hicks / Creative Director For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-21-jun-2016",

Current top issues for a hotfix are: - AI Related Server Crash - Container Lifetime Refresh Issue - Known Duplication Methods - Vehicle Location/Position Persistence With those being worked on - the milestone goals for 0.60 have been achieved, and we can look forward towards our goals for 0.61. 0.60 Build Milestone Goals: - New Renderer: Implemented - Randomized Attachments & ItemsRandom: Implemented - New Reload Mechanics: Implemented - 60 Player-per-instance: Implemented 0.61 Milestone Goals: - Server Login Queue - Merge of New Audio Technology from Arma 3 Eden Update - Update of Weapon Sounds for New Audio Technology - Dynamic Spawning of Infected - Predators (Wolves) I'll be at RTX in Austin, Texas early next month to talk about 0.61 and show some early representations of some of the systems, as well as recap 0.60 and what was achieved there. For those not attending the show, we'll be recording the audio off the sound board - and will match it with the presentation media and upload to our Youtube channel. Lastly, we'll be experimenting with uploads to our DayZDevTeam YouTube channel at 4k on the new nVidia GTX 1080 card, so for those eager to see how that performs on 0.60 - keep an eye out for that. A massive thanks from all of us at the DayZ Dev Team to those participating in the Early Access period and especially to the 415,000 who have joined us in testing 0.60 over the last two weeks. ​- Brian Hicks / Creative Director For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-21-jun-2016",

Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Its that time again - so lets take a look at last weeks blockers on 0.60 experimental, talk about their status - and outline the current priority issues on the road to 0.60 stable branch.

The CLE for DayZ is an interestingly complex tool that manages over 3 million potential spawn points, covers all potential tag and category classifications for items, and structures, is dynamic enough to be adapted to new maps for mod authors in the future, in some cases monitors items not only in the gamespace but also within player camps and player inventories. Each item in DayZ has its own values configured dynamically within this tool covering: Minimum Amount: Bottom end point in which the system will begin respawning once quantities drop below Nominal Amount: Targeted operating value in which items respawning at the minimum point will respawn to Lifetime: Duration the item can be persisting in the world before being cleaned up to free up space for new items Restock: Value used for rare/controlled items to ensure that if they fall below the minimum they do not respawn in bulk and allow loot cycling of rare items Tiering: Regions of the world in which these items are allowed to respawn And quite a bit more The CLE is an integral component in DayZ gameplay, and has evolved throughout the Early Access period thanks to us being able to observe raw data from the Experimental and Stable branch servers. DayZ Mod had a very basic, rudimentary trigger based spawning controlled via script and having to populate no more than around 10,000 potential points - only spawning within proximity to players. DayZ spawns globally, and has evolved to allow more and more precise and complex control over when/where/how much/etc and we continue to iterate upon it, constantly trying to find that right point in which we offer a struggle to survive, without allowing abuse or making the experience *too* punishing. For .60 we're hoping to have the restock values functioning properly for the first time on controlled high end military gear, and pending testing on experimental branch we'll see if this value will function properly enough to allow us to use it for the entire economy - potentially creating points of shortage / supply & demand rotating throughout the servers life.

We're all just as equally frustrated by this as the rest of you - but let's focus on what is new since our last Status Report: Error Messages when picking up any item with attachments that has been placed on the ground, and then moved to inventory: Fixed Player Item Loss when logging off while holding backpack: Fixed Several server crashes causing VERY short server uptime: Current known server crashes are fixed Client crashes when navigating certain coastal cities: Reproducible client crashes related to rendering are fixed Weapon Attachments twitching randomly out of sync with weapon and player hands: In progress Client stuck on black screen after launching PC in some configurations: 50% of known causes are fixed, the remaining are in progress Players seeing other players stuck in climbing animation in some situations: Reproducible known causes have been fixed Client crash after exiting to Main Menu in some configurations: Fixed Character unable to see their clothing after initial spawn and login: Fixed Client Crash when connecting to a new server: Current known causes of this issue are fixed Roads visible through some objects: Fixed Characters prevented from logging in once connected: Fix pending testing Now, be careful not to get too excited. We still need to push the latest test build to experimental to see what issues are still present, and discover any new issues. However, in addition to the bug fixes listed above we have also made changes in the areas of: Configured new buildings for loot spawning Tweaks to percentage chance for random items in civilian inventory has been modified Dynamic Event weapons have been temporarily moved to spawn in all applicable military structures Randomized loot on infected (likely to end up in .61) Modifications to jamming functionality (we've dialed this down dramatically pending functional changes for future builds to allow us to attain desired behavior) Beyond this, the Engine programming team have been working on some outstanding new things for post .60 in way of: Shadows from dynamic lights Replacement of legacy particle system (Smoke, Debris, Blood, Freezing Breath, Fires, etc) http://i.imgur.com/SWoG5vb.jpg Lastly for this Status Report, we should be ready to push a new experimental build soon and I'd like to take the time to thank the over 196,000 unique players who have contributed to the testing of experimental branch build 0.60.

Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings survivors, Now that PAX is over lets take a quick look at what we're doing to tackle the last Status Report’s listed blockers, and what issues are between us and .60 hitting experimental (so you're all in the know). - Loot Distribution: The QA, Design, and Gameplay Programming teams have isolated the cause of the issue, specifically tied to stalling of item respawn - while initial server spawn, and server cleanup are functioning properly. The Gameplay Programmers responsible for this are hard at work nailing down a fix to this issue, and a possible solution has been handed to QA - we will run it through the QA department for verification. - \"Stuck Magazines\": This issue has been resolved, and the QA Team are no longer able to reproduce it. Strike one more issue from the list. - Sliding Players: All of the reproducible methods for causing this issue have been flagged and resolved by the gameplay programming team, and have been verified by QA. - Playability of New UI Inventory - The team has finished all remaining changes needed to be ready for .60 experimental - once the build is in the hands of the experimental userbase, we'll be able to make any required adjustments or improvements based upon how they interact with it. In addition to these previous issues, the engine and gameplay programming teams are currently working on resolving two issues we'd like to see solved prior to hitting experimental: - FPS Drop / Clouds: Internal Testing discovered a 100% reproducible frame drop to single digit factors on limited hardware configurations. While the issue only appeared on 2 out of 30+ PCs, we're taking it very seriously. That said, the engine programming team has committed a fix and QA are verifying it as of the time of this report. - Server Crash: We've encountered an issue with unconscious players reconnecting / logging in to a fresh server sometimes causing the server to suffer an unexpected crash. Obviously we'll need to get this resolved before pushing to a large userbase because no one likes playing on servers that are consistently crashing - and we all know there will be plenty of unconscious survivors throughout Chernarus. That said, the gameplay programming team have a solid repro, and all the crashdumps and server logs they could want, and are tracking this issue down as I write this. As you can see, we're knocking issues down one by one, and each day brings us closer to pushing the first .60 experimental build to Steam. Keep in mind, this will be just like every other experimental upload and will have issues. So lets all chip in and make sure to submit good bug data when encountering them - Quality Assurance Lead Ondrej Klima gave some excellent pointers in how to submit the best bug data possible in our last Dev Q&A video on the official Youtube Channel. All of us here at the DayZ dev team cannot wait get .60 on to experimental branch. The excitement and support at PAX East was overwhelming, and there are still so many more improvements to the technology powering DayZ to come! - Brian Hicks / Creative Director For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-26-apr-2016",

Subjects covered by the guys are blocker issues, network code, the new AI spawner, and the new animation system. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Community Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, It’s that time again - biweekly Status Report time. In addition to my update, we have some interesting reads from Miroslav our Lead Gameplay Programmer, Viktor our Lead Animator, and Raist the Senior Programmer responsible for DayZ's Central Economy. That aside, let’s look at what our current critical issues are for the release of .60 to experimental branch. Loot Distribution: Current internal builds have an issue we're chasing down that drops globally spawned quantities of items to about 3,000 in certain situations/server states. This is around 17,000 to 18,000 less than the acceptable minimal operating value. This issue is one of the top priorities for the designers currently, as it effectively makes the title near unplayable. \"Stuck\" Magazines: The gameplay programming team are working on an issue that causes magazines during the reload process to become \"stuck\" within the players inventory, thus causing several cascading failures with players inventories requiring them to disconnect and reconnect to resolve the issue. Sliding Players: The QA Team encountered a 100% repro rate series of steps to cause players to become stuck in a sliding state - regardless of laying, prone, or erect. These steps have been provided to the gameplay programming team - and they are working on resolving the issue. Playability of New UI Inventory: The design and gameplay programming teams are wrapping up the last of the playability issues moving to the new UI, as functional support for the legacy UI won't be possible moving forward with the new Enfusion renderer. Since the last Status Report the team has nailed down the last blocking bugs on the renderer side, squashed some nasty virtual machine server exception issues, resolved blocking issues with navmesh generation, infected AI behavior, several critical client crash bugs, a new nasty issue with the desync of player positions, and rolled out the support for configuring all the initial required graphical options within the options menu for the new renderer release. Looking at what the Engine Programming team have taken on and ahead of them for the Enfusion Renderer: MSAA Implementation Alpha to Coverage Implementation Resolved all issues flagged as \"Must Fix\" or \"Blocker\" for .60 Current Focus is on: New UI and Renderer Major & Minor severity level issues Aside from the current issues I've mentioned above, personally I'm a bit concerned of the network state of vehicles. With the team focused on the milestone goals for .60 we haven't been able to give the attention to iterating on network synchronization, performance, and physics on our current group of vehicles. I think they're far from where I'd like them to be - but we'll more than likely have to put off improving their state to somewhere more enjoyable for the Early Access playerbase to future builds. Each day moves us closer to having a build we're confident and able to move to experimental branch, and no one group of people want it out there more than us, the developers. Lastly, before I sign off for this Status Report - I know I've said it before - but I can't say it enough, keep in mind this is just our first public iteration of this portion of Enfusion engine. In addition to iteration and progression from feedback and bug reports from the Early Access player base we'll also be working with GPU manufacturers to figure out how best to use their technologies to the maximum effect, and get DayZ optimized for use in future drivers from said manufacturers. - Brian Hicks / Creative Director For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-12-apr-2016",

It is far less dangerous than its rough cast of heroes and miscreants want you to believe and many have complained that there is almost no incentive to kill the other human players who roam there. It is less a Dark Zone and more of a Slightly Gloomy Zone. But despite the problems, I still think it is the most interesting part of post-Bigpox Manhattan. Let me tell you why. &#8230; ",

We have a bit of info on blocker issues for 0.60 as well as which subjects will be in focus for the immediate future. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Dev Update/Viktor Community Spotlight: Days of Z Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Hey everyone. While I don't have an experimental build for you today - I do have good news and an update on what is going on with the blockers, how far we've got with them, and so on: Inventory UI User controls within the new inventory look to be at parity with the old inventory system. The last few remaining issues are a few nasty blocking bugs on the functional side, such as items missing their icons. Reload mechanics The QA team have worked with the design and animation teams to get a firm handle on exactly where the inconsistencies are with the new reload mechanics, and said teams are working on resolving the issue. I think we can all agree that when we push a large change to how weapons reload - they damn better all reload with the same mechanics ;) Character Loading/Saving Proper character loading/saving is back, and in the process some nice network optimizations in this area were made! Renderer based blocking issues We've cut the list of blocker flagged issues tied to the new Enfusion renderer in half since the last time we talked - and in the time since our last Status Report the Enfusion engine team has made some outstanding optimizations across Chernarus - which you can see the result of in the latest .60 Dev Log video that you see below. In addition, while the Enfusion engine team was able to commit and test their latest optimizations, the automated performance benchmarking tool briefly discussed in the latest .60 Dev Log video has enabled the environment team to begin to isolate problematic issues with certain areas of the map that would not otherwise be noticed. We're excited to see these fixes give us yet another small bump up in Enfusion's new renderer performance. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXxEX1XVTg As we get closer to bringing .60 to experimental branch, I lightly urge you all to temper your excitement with a few brief statements of reality about public development of a title, and its engine: .60 is focused on UI, and Renderer - it does not feature the new animation system, player controller, or user actions We still have plenty of issues ahead of us to tackle, the renderer is but one hurdle on the road to a complete DayZ Network Optimizations, Server Performance Optimization (This is a big one, standing between us and more players, more infected, more animals), Animation System, Eden Update Audio Tech merge, and more are all ahead of us So I encourage you to keep your eye on the proverbial prize here and report your bugs over on the official DayZ forums, be active in testing these new technology changes, and be a part of moving DayZ towards 1.0 Before I wrap up my part for this Status Report, I'd like to include an excerpt from a post I made over on the official forums - that I think a lot of you might have missed: \"I frequently get asked why a specific bug might not be resolved yet, or why something hasn't been addressed yet in development that from a players perspective might seem critical. There are a lot of things to take into consideration in development when weighing a bugfix, not to mention when you're dealing with a title transitioning from one engine, to another one that is *in development* Lets take a quick look into a brief break down of how the thought process goes: - First off - what is the risk of this fix at the current time? What are the goals for the upcoming build? Does this potentially represent larger issues that will push the build back? Is this issue tied to a technology that is going to be replaced? For example - Is this an issue tied with the legacy renderer? Is this issue related to ongoing investigation of a larger issue with wider sweeping impact on the title? If this issue IS tied to a system scheduled to be rewritten or replaced - what is the estimated time involved in: Work resolving the issue itself Test pass on the issue Overall BVT test pass to ensure related issues are not encountered Regression testing on the issue A lot of issues consumers see in the way of: Duplicating (Old action system) Glitching into models Damage / Projectile cheats Balancing / etc Are all things that are slated to be resolved, or at least mitigated with new technologies that are being worked on *right now* - so the hard decision has to be made - Do we potentially waste valuable development time and resources on something that will *not* end up in the shipped title? Honestly - we try to do that as little as possible. We still end up going a very large amount of it to try and keep the consumer steam branches as playable as possible, but frequently the unpopular and hard decision has to be made to stay the course, and dedicated those resources towards the final product / final systems / final technology.\" - Brian Hicks / Creative Director For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-29-Mar-2016",

Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Mirek Dev Update/Viktor Community Spotlight: Tom's Story Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Hey guys, its that time again - Status Report day. I know you all wanted to hear some crazy hype tastic reveal like - FREE OCULUS RIFT HEADSETS UNDER EACH OF YOUR COMPUTER DESKS OMG YAY (but more specific to our upcoming .60 experimental push) but I'm afraid I don't have that for you today, and we don't do hype like that anyways. While we've made strides in client side performance functionality, we're still chipping away at blocking issues in the following areas: Inventory UI With the move to Direct X 11, we'll no longer be able to support the legacy user interface. Thus, functional parity with the legacy UI -has- to be achieved on the new UI. The design team are currently working on resolving the last few bugs blocking us from having that parity. Reload mechanics The move in .60 to involving manual bolt cycling, as well as misfire and jamming management via the charging handle on weapons such as the M4 has an impact on every firearm in the game. We're currently working to resolve some functional hiccups in the switching between magazines, and the need to chamber twice before firing from a new magazine. Character Loading/Saving A very large volume of unneeded traffic was discovered when investigating issues with character loading - a rewrite of the methods used to save and load from the central hive. Once we restore proper functionality, this area will no longer be a blocker. Tasks Completed: - .60 Build Optimization Pass (Performance in cities increased by 50% from initial build - optimization is ONGOING however) - Cleared Rendering Test Pass list of visual/rendering based bugs - Renderer settings UI Current Focus: - MSAA Hardware Multisampling Support - Alpha to Coverage GPU Feature (Which will increase quality of vegetation rendering) - Finalization of In-Game UI Features We've heard a lot of feedback wanting some changes to how we're communicating development information over the last year - and we started steps a few months back towards adjusting to try and meet some of these requests. We've expanded the community team and put processes in to ensure that regardless of development tasks, the Status Reports will come out on schedule (Tuesdays, BiWeekly). In addition, we've begun using our YouTube channel more - to show upcoming changes to DayZ as they are developed. (Status Reports talk about development progress, and what changes are planned in the future - where as the YouTube channel should show what is coming in the next build - when it is functional enough to demonstrate) We'll also be trying a team Q&A type video where folks can ask questions about what its like to work on DayZ, work at Bohemia, and such - our first video on this from our Quality Assurance team should be coming shortly. Our Community Manager Smo55 is ramping up his presence on our subreddit and official forums, our new Brand Manager DHawkz is working with Bohemia Interactive publishing to expand the options for DayZ merchandise on the BI Store, and a redesign of DayZ.com, as well as working with our hardware partners to create opportunities for raising awareness of DayZ as it moves towards our Beta, and Release goals. I'll be discussing some of the systems and pending changes tied to the new animation system and player controller over on the official forums later this week, and next up for the YouTube channel we're working on our next Dev Log video on .60 covering performance comparisons between Direct X 9, and Direct X 11 rendering. Once .60 hits experimental branch, we'll start putting together our first \"Whats new with .60\" video - where DHawkz, Smo55, and I go over the changes in .60 and what to expect gameplay wise - for our YouTube channel. Lastly - as .60's time on experimental starts to draw to a close - we'll be bringing back the official DayZ survival gaming e-sport, The Survivor GameZ. The Survivor GameZ VII Qualifiers will be a fantastic way for us to stress test .60 before it hits stable, and to see how the new inventory, and reloading/chambering mechanics work in a high stress situation.

However, this was expected as a high chance. We are of course working hard on getting it ready, and on to experimental branch as soon as possible. Our work currently is focused on optimization of the performance inside major cities in Chernarus. New Chernogorsk has caused us some performance hickups we want to resolve to an acceptable playable frame rate. The engine team has a daunting task ahead of them, focusing on the last few hurdles to unlock the capabilities of the renderer while still combating and improving legacy engine scene management. With trouble areas in the DirectX 9 area dipping as low as the mid teens in some situations, we consider it critical to isolate those areas and ensure we can hold a stable 30fps (In Direct X 11) in them. Globally, frame rates on average can be in the 40 to 60 range on average - so obviously our focus right now is in those major cities. It is key to keep in mind as said many times before - this is just the first iteration. In addition to continuing bugfixes on into beta and the 1.0 release, the new renderer technology will open up many new particle effects to the design team, and we'll be working with GPU manufacturers for cross testing to isolate areas in which hardware specific optimizations can be made. Tasks Completed: Implementation of all base renderer features Simulweather/True Sky Implementation Current Focus: Optimization of major cities Dynamic Lights Finalization of New Renderer Settings UI/Options Implementation of New UI Bug Fix, Bug Fix, Bug Fix I'm confident that a global increase in frame rate playability, as well as a huge upgrade in the visuals in DayZ are going to be well worth the work that has gone into the part of the Enfusion engine, and I can't wait to share it with you all. While .60 obviously focuses most heavily on implementing the engine's new renderer - .60 also has continued iteration on the Central Economy (something I think many people don't realize is VERY critical to the DayZ experience) with the audit mentioned in previous Status Reports complete, as well as changes to the tagging for weapons. Changes to vehicle spawn points, initial attachments, and finally - weapons are both spawning with random attachments AND a chance to spawn with magazines that have a random amount of ammo inside them. Beyond .60 - the teams next major updates focus is primarily on the new animation system and player controller. For the end user, it is important to understand these large engine changes have been holding back fixes on a lot of legacy issues with the title, as well as much larger over all changes to how DayZ plays - including, but not limited to DayZ's new user actions - something that I feel paired with the renderer, and new UI complete a 3 part massive change to how DayZ *plays*. In addition, the gameplay programming team's work on the new damage system - which will be explained in a bit more detail below by Lead Gameplay Programmer Mirek. The members of the programming team focusing on the Central Economy also continue to work on the deployable version of the CLE & Database structure for use by both mod authors and private server operators alike - as well as functionality for DayZ's local offline mode. On the Early Access / Community side - our forum transition is complete, and DayZ.com forums are back online. As some of you may know the feedback tracker is offline while we transition to a new software option for it. This shouldn't be down too much longer, as it is critical to providing an outlet to those testing DayZ's development builds to communicate the issues they encounter while doing so. We know that members of the community have wanted to see an increase or change in the format of our outbound communication, and that too has received some love this month. We've done some restructuring in the processes behind these, as well as the structure of responsibilities. We're hoping that over the coming month you'll all enjoy the changes in this area - and we'll be keeping an eye on your reactions. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-01-Mar-2016",

We've discussed our intent to have a .60 build in the hands of the consumers at the end of February, and while that is still our goal - we'll have to see how bug fixing and implementation go over the coming weeks to see if that means Stable Branch, or Experimental. As we've discussed before - part of the .60 build is our initial implementation of the new renderer (operating off of DirectX 11). Now, while keeping in mind this will be the first build of this in the hands of the Early Access userbase - I'm still cautiously (very) optimistic. The engine programming team are hard at work squashing a large chunk of visual and optimization related bugs - but even with those said bugs present, we're seeing some excellent performance gains across Chernarus. While it may not be quite ready for regular gameplay on the consumer branches, internal QA and the Engine Dev team are working hard at polishing the stone, so to speak. Even with the current internal DX11 client running with AntiAliasing, Alpha Coverage, Edge Smoothing, Clouds, and Post Processing disabled - the improvement of visual fidelity vs the legacy DX 9 client is clearly visible. http://i.imgur.com/0q9uj7S.jpg Direct X 9 - Max Settings http://i.imgur.com/pLgtcsZ.jpg Direct X 11 - Low Settings http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFhTsoM-KZI Tasks Completed: - Detailed Terrain Shadows - Parallelization - Initial Simulweather/True Sky Implementation Current Focus: - Optimization - Lights - Finalizing Simulweather / Truesky - Bug Fix, Bug Fix, Bug Fix Past the work on the new renderer technology - the design and art teams are working on the initial art/skinning for the Main Menu, Server Browser, and Inventory Screen - while the gameplay programming team works on finishing implementation of requested functionality, and bugfixing. I'm personally excited for changes in the Central Economy coming with .60. As we've spent time triaging the root cause of repeated/grouped item spawns, and improper distribution globally (thanks to outstanding help on the feedback tracker ticket from twitch.tv/sacriel and his viewerbase) we've greatly improved the global item saturation and drastically dropped occurances of item spawns repeating within a cluster of structures. As well as the above mentioned changes - the discussed randomization of vehicle part attachments has been iterated upon and the tech passed on to include firearms, and their attachments. What does this mean for the average survivor wandering across Chernarus? Each weapon has a chance to spawn with random attachments fitting its configuration In addition to its base attachments The more varied the weapons potential attachments - the more random the potential configuration Eg: An M4A1 with a BUIS sight, OE handguard, 40 round magazine, etc In addition to this change in how weapons are spawned - magazine initial spawn capacity is now controlled dynamically via the central economy control. This allows the development team to set the initial ammo quantity for magazines to a lower value - thus increasing the global *quantity* of magazines. But enough about the economy - as we continue to bugfix and optimize the new renderer, and user interface technology in preperation for .60 we'll keep the information coming on how it is performing, how its looking, and how it is expected to function. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-16-feb-2016",

As we've spent time triaging the root cause of repeated/grouped item spawns, and improper distribution globally (thanks to outstanding help on the feedback tracker ticket from twitch.tv/sacriel and his viewerbase) we've greatly improved the global item saturation and drastically dropped occurances of item spawns repeating within a cluster of structures. As well as the above mentioned changes - the discussed randomization of vehicle part attachments has been iterated upon and the tech passed on to include firearms, and their attachments. What does this mean for the average survivor wandering across Chernarus? Each weapon has a chance to spawn with random attachments fitting its configuration In addition to its base attachments The more varied the weapons potential attachments - the more random the potential configuration Eg: An M4A1 with a BUIS sight, OE handguard, 40 round magazine, etc In addition to this change in how weapons are spawned - magazine initial spawn capacity is now controlled dynamically via the central economy control. This allows the development team to set the initial ammo quantity for magazines to a lower value - thus increasing the global *quantity* of magazines. But enough about the economy - as we continue to bugfix and optimize the new renderer, and user interface technology in preperation for .60 we'll keep the information coming on how it is performing, how its looking, and how it is expected to function. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer For the full Status Report, please use the following link: http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-16-feb-2016",

DayZ tends to chug on most hardware in any built-up area&mdash;the rendering is tied to the simulation, so more to simulate means spikier motion, regardless of graphics settings. For the first time,&nbsp;Lead Producer Brian Hicks has&nbsp;shown off what some were beginning to believe&nbsp;<a href=\"\">was a myth</a>.&nbsp;It has a way to go before it reaches the public experimental build, but&nbsp;the DirectX 11&nbsp;Enfusion Engine&nbsp;renderer is a noticeable improvement. Rain, everyone's favourite weather effect, is denser, bleaker and much more wet, falling in sheets instead of specks and, if you can believe it, no longer ignoring roofs. Watch until after the end of Hicks' preview and you'll see him picking off zombies that emerge from the deluge as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/bohemia-shows-horde-ai-for-dayz-zombies/\" target=\"_blank\">grim, uncertain shapes</a>. Recording brings the framerate down on both the DX9 renderer and the new Enfusion renderer of course, but we're told that the drop is considerably smaller with the new tech. Once the renderer goes live, we'll&nbsp;finally be able to use those GPUs we've got sitting around. ",

Today it put out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dayzdevteam\">more detailed and dire message</a>, indicating that the situation is rather worse than it first appeared. A security incident occurred on forums.dayzgame.com recently. According to our investigation all usernames, emails and passwords from <a href=\"http://forums.dayz.com/\">forums.dayzgame.com</a> were accessed and downloaded by hackers, it says. While the passwords were not stored in plain text, but in a more secure form, it is highly recommended that if you have used the same password elsewhere you change it immediately on all applicable websites and services. Even encrypted, or 'hashed' passwords, can sometimes&nbsp;be used to compromise accounts with&nbsp;some work (here's&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table\">old example</a>), so if you use the same password on any other sites, it's time to change it.&nbsp; Bohemia says it has major changes planned to reduce the likelihood of this sort of thing happening again, including a switch from the current IPBoard login system to the separate and more secure Bohemia Accounts. It also warned that service interruptions over the next few weeks are likely to happen as the systems are migrated to the new setup. For those who may not have yet checked email, here is an update on our recent security breach.

This Status Report comes a little bit later than normal due to the team getting back into the office, and people getting settled. We're all focused on assessing the tasks ahead of us between here and beta - and prioritizing the when and how those larger engine changes will make their way to the consumer branch on Steam. Over the last week as far as Steam goes - we've pushed a small update addressing some security issues, as well as merging over some pending filters changes for the New UI. Enough about that though - you all want to know whats going on with the under the hood type stuff - so lets get to that. Keep in mind, we're at the start of the year - so not too much content changes will be featured in this week’s Status Report, but we will be talking about DayZ's underlying engine - and pending changes. On the design side, Peter and his team have been focused on several awesome upcoming changes to DayZ, as well as addressing some nagging economy bugs that we've been able to nail down thanks to Feedback Tracker usage. - Finalizing gameplay design for player constructed fortifications (tiers of walls/fences) - Finalizing gameplay design for player constructed watch towers - Complete audit of item category and tagging configuration (every spawnable item in game) Over in the gameplay programming team, Mirek and crew have kicked off 2016 with the following tasks: - Damage System implementation - Central Hive/Servlet Package for DayZ Server tool - Servlet & DayZ Server Modding Support - Central Economy Region Control & Tools - Expanding required fluids and parts for vehicles The Enfusion/DayZ Engine team have kicked off the new year right. - Extensive New UI bugfixing - Cooperation w/ Design & Art on New UI skin prototype - Optimization & Parallelization of Renderer Straight from the mouth of Filip Doksansky, Lead Engine Programmer for Enfusion - the current renderer goals and progress are as follows: Tasks Completed: - Ocean Rendering - Parallelization - Post Processes Current Focus: - Simulweather (True Sky) Implementation - Detailed Terrain Shadows - Dynamic Lights - Optimization Pass Internally we're hoping to have our next .60 update out late next month. I don't want to get any of you too hyped, but internally we've been observing outstanding client side performance (frame rate) with the new renderer technology. Paired with the performance increase of the New UI, and iteration upon the inventory and UI skinning - we're *hoping* to see .60 be a hell of an update. Please keep in mind as these systems are merged into test we could easily stumble across blocking issues, and we'll continue to keep everyone appraised on the status of these if they arise. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Community Spotlight: Wolverine 60fps Evening people, Hope you all had a good start in the new year. Over the holidays there was plenty of extra time to look at videos created by DayZ players. While doing so, I found my way to this guy's channel: \"Wolverine 60fps\".

In a <a href=\"https://www.bistudio.com/blog/dayz-reflects-on-the-past-looks-to-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">dev blog</a> today, Bohemia took a brief look back at its trek through Early Access and detailed some of the major updates we can expect before version 1.0 arrives next year. The choice morsels include modding support, aerial vehicles (the Little Bird helicopter ought to arrive soon in the new year), a new renderer, new animation system (this one has been a long time coming), updated UI and 'fluid movement' within the world. I'm excited! Heck, I was excited two years ago, but that petered out when it dawned how far off the finished product was&mdash;now, I'm excited again, because that list contains acknowledgements of DayZ's deepest, most enduring flaws and a pledge to get them fixed.

This Status Report will be the last one for this year, as for the last two weeks of this month the team slowly starts heading home to spend the holidays with their families. That said, we have some cool stuff to talk about and show this week, as well as updates on the major engine work everyone is curious about - and even a few new screenshots. ONCE AGAIN - BE AWARE THAT 0.59 STABLE UPDATE BRINGS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL WIPE OF CHARACTERS, ITEMS, AND SERVER DATA! Later today we will bring the Stable Branch servers offline for the 0.59 update. Changelog should follow shortly after the update - and notifications on the service will come from the official DayZ Dev Team twitter account. twitter.com/dayzdevteam Please keep in mind - this is but one build on the path of development. It will have its own issues, absent features, bugs, and so on - the best thing you can do to help bring DayZ towards the game we all can't wait to see it become is to file those bugs over at feedback.dayzgame.com !

Animation System: Currently Completed: - Animation Engine Base - Animation Engine Editor Current Focus: - Infected, Player, and Animal skeleton support/graph production - Finishing synchronizations - Finishing differential animations - Ramp up for animators on new technology Next Up: - Add nodes to support more extensive functionality - Synthetic Rotations - Removing legacy animation system tech once deprecated Renderer: Currently Completed: - DX 11 Water Surface Rendering - DX 11 Ambient Occlusion Current Focus: - Optimization / Parrellization - Clouds Rendering http://i.imgur.com/ETewFL5.jpg http://i.imgur.com/h3AbTWa.jpg While at PAX Australia I spoke briefly on how I'd like to be able to bring the Little Bird to stable branch before Christmas - and how if anything prevented that I'd make sure to let you all know. That said - the programming teams now have the first of our aircraft operating on the proper physics system, however multiplayer sync is not quite ready for the Steam branches. While we won't be seeing in time for Christmas - I'm confident we're not too far off now. :) Keep an eye on the DayZ Trello board to track the progress of this task! http://i.imgur.com/oS1eFTA.jpg That said!

This Status Report will be the last one for this year, as for the last two weeks of this month the team slowly starts heading home to spend the holidays with their families. That said, we have some cool stuff to talk about and show this week, as well as updates on the major engine work everyone is curious about - and even a few new screenshots. ONCE AGAIN - BE AWARE THAT 0.59 STABLE UPDATE BRINGS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL WIPE OF CHARACTERS, ITEMS, AND SERVER DATA! Later today we will bring the Stable Branch servers offline for the 0.59 update. Changelog should follow shortly after the update - and notifications on the service will come from the official DayZ Dev Team twitter account. twitter.com/dayzdevteam Please keep in mind - this is but one build on the path of development. It will have its own issues, absent features, bugs, and so on - the best thing you can do to help bring DayZ towards the game we all can't wait to see it become is to file those bugs over at feedback.dayzgame.com !

But there are some limitations. Only perks and rewards that don't impact gameplay can be offered; the sale of items including \"in-game money, weapons, ammo, vehicles, discounts, vehicle spawns, housing and any other gameplay affecting features\" are not allowed, and servers offering them will not be approved. The use of mods on monetized servers is okay, but only with permission from the mod maker; product placement, in-game advertising, and sponsorships are also allowed. The accompanying&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bistudio.com/monetization/faq\">Server Monetization FAQ</a> takes pains to differentiate between accepting donations, which has been allowable all along, and charging for access, which has not. Simply put, if you're offering any kind of reward in exchange for money, then it's not a donation, it's a sale&mdash;and in that case, you'll have to register your server for approval. Bohemia, which isn't taking a cut of the server income, described the rollout of server monetization as a \"test run,\" and as such it will come to an end on May 31 of 2016. \"At that point, we will evaluate its effects on the community,\" the studio wrote.

If you don't happen to follow twitter or the forums you may not be aware of the current focus on iterating upon 0.59 experimental. Obviously the team is working hard to resolve the issues with server side performance, as well as pushing several new potential changes to vehicle position sync to QA. So the big question everyone wants to know - when will 0.59 move to stable? - Once we are satisfied with server side performance at maximum player count vs 12 hour uptime - Vehicle Position Sync is at a marked improvement over 0.58 - High repro (reproducible) server and client crashes are resolved Past 0.59 - internally we are -hoping- to be able to get another update out prior to Christmas (to experimental at the very least). However, that will depend on the stability of the build post 0.59 stable and the merges done right after that. As mentioned during the PAX Australia \"The Road to Beta\" presentation - we'll keep everyone updated on this progress via the official Twitter account, and the Status Reports between then and now. -KEEP IN MIND: THE UPDATE OF 0.59 TO STABLE WILL INCLUDE A FULL HIVE AND SERVER STORAGE RESET. THIS INCLUDES PRIVATE SHARDS OF THE HIVE- Moving past discussion around 0.59 experimental, lets move on to discussing what the current status of some of the major engine side updates are. Renderer Completed within October - Multiple Cascade Shadow Maps - Updated Rain Postprocess - Updated HDR & Glow Current Focus - Finalizing postprocesses - Multithread Optimizations Next Up - Small bodies of water, and Ocean rendering - True Sky rendering We have some screenshots from debug that we can discuss in a little more detail as well. (Please take care to understand these are from debug machines - and are thus running lower resolutions/over all configurations and are meant to display technical tests) http://i.imgur.com/EZZaZmZ.jpg In the above screenshot we can see improved cooperation between the HDR and Glow Effects. http://i.imgur.com/VYLKd0F.jpg http://i.imgur.com/o0aWWj7.jpg Within the above screenshots we can see fog improved with proper height base. http://i.imgur.com/w90L8Rc.jpg In this screenshot in the distance we can see Aerial Perspective Fog, with the additional effect of light scattering http://i.imgur.com/kRt8P9A.jpg Here we see an early iteration of improved dynamic range hopefully allowing us differing light levels between interiors and exteriors. http://i.imgur.com/A1i45wr.jpg http://i.imgur.com/X3hKTqv.jpg The above screenshots show the current iteration of updates done to rain - which should allow a more rich, and believable downpour situation. Paired potentially with fog, this will greatly impact visibility during adverse weather conditions. Animation System / Player Controller The animation system and new player controller both are major elements of DayZ's engine that are in progress. The new actions done in Enforce Script can not enter experimental testing until the animation system fully supports all the necessary functions from the legacy animation system. I know I've gone on, and on about the total rewrite of actions in game being a massive change to how DayZ plays - and I hate to sound like a broken record. HOWEVER - I personally cannot state this enough. The change from the clunky old fashioned method used by DayZ, DayZ Mod, Arma 3, Arma 2, and so on to a new and more dynamic system will change a hell of a lot more than how you eat a bag of rice, or pick apples. I genuinely believe this will be one of the most massive changes to DayZ gameplay and completely redefine how the title is experienced. That said - while we're all desperate to see this in the hands of consumers before the holiday break - A more reliable estimate (playing it safe and assuming we'll encounter critical bugs and blockers once this is merged into the main testing branch) would be to expect it early in the beginning of the new year.

So, this is the first SR since the change in vocal style and frequency - and it just happens to come on the heels of our Quarterly Review and Beta discussion at PAX Australia. I appreciate everyones patience as I deal with jet lag catching up with me. We have some cool stuff to talk about this week - not as cool as the last Status Report - but cool enough I think. I'd like to kick off this week with an update on a few key areas of the engine I know everyone is waiting to hear about. Renderer: I touched on this a bit during the PAX Australia presentation (and that audio/slides will be put out as soon as I get back to Prague) - Post Processes: IN PROGRESS - Water & Ocean Surfaces: IN PROGRESS - Optimization & Paralellization: IN PROGRESS Current Status: Actively under testing with internal QA We've made some great progress over the last few weeks. I prefer to manage expectations - so I'm going to say don't get too excited. Issues could pop up in QA over the next few weeks, but morale in the office regarding the renderer is getting high. I'm excited - but keep in mind we don't want it to hit experimental until we're confident in a strong -initial- performance gain. New Animation System: While we've made strong gains on this that has enabled the design team to start working on a complete rewrite of all player actions currently in game (demonstrated in the last SR) we're still working on the last few areas that -must- be completed in order to fully merge the player over to the new player controller. We'll keep you all updated on this. Infected: As we mentioned in the last Status Report - Infected will be making a return in .59 - but as covered in the PAX presentation there are changes we'd like to look into making to the infected, specifically in the area of spawning and distribution that should go miles towards a more rewarding (and scary!) experience when it comes to crawling through cities looking for gear. .59 Experimental: As of the time that I boarded my flight to PAX Aus - the last remaining major blocker towards moving this build to the exp branch was sitting specifically on vehicle position sync. It is critical we at the very least provide a more enjoyable experience with vehicles than on previous builds, especially considering the increased quantities. The gameplay programming team has been working hard on doing just this. Aside from the stuff mentioned above - we do have a few cool things to share with you guys. As those of you who watched the TwitchCon presentation, you know part of the character progression path we've been working on in addition to soft skills - is the life span of the character. Specifically shown at TwitchCon as beards for male characters. What we didn't share at the time was that we were a bit further along with this than just a few renders of male heads. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upHAL5mNH6c We still need to work on the lifespan impact for female characters - but we do have growth over time functioning on internal builds as seen in the above video. Animations for shaving still need to be completed, but the functionality for choosing to remove said beard as there as well. In the same vein as character life span - I spoke today about how the initial skill set for soft skills was functioning internally (albeit without UI elements allowing you to track said skills). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06xggXwHCdQ In the video above, we have accelerated the growth of the skillset that governs the amount of resources you gain from harvesting. (In this grim case - it happens to be a human body) The more a character performs an action that falls under this skillset, the higher yield the resources he gains from the attempt. In the accelerated video we have a character who very often skins and quarters bodies for meat, bone, and so on. As the character goes through each body, we accelerate the skill gain for the purposes of the video - but you see that with each action/attempt - the yield of meat is increased. We want to kick off the character soft skills with base skills in the areas of: Medical, Resource Gathering, Repairing. Once we see how these operate, we can expand upon them further. The little icing on the cake I like about the video is how Peter snuck a little treat in there that you can easily overlook. As the character skins and quarters the body, his hands and forearms are covered in a bloody mess. The character -can- wash this off should they go to a body of water, or have some on him. Alternatively, he or she could just as easily choose to keep this appearance. Oh! Before we move on to Peter's bit this week - Things are looking really good for the 75 player servers, I'm excited to see how it plays out on experimental. Questions? Suggestions? Make sure to head over to the official DayZ Forums and join the Status Report discussion thread for this week. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Dev Update/Peter In the last status report, there was a nice showcase of new implementations of user actions which are currently work in progress. There was an idea back in the day (and I mean it was a really long time ago, more then year and a half) about simplifying of how user actions operate and streamlining controls in general. User actions as we know them are great as they are very robust and allow usage of anything in any way you like, which leads for such a great ArmA 2 mod as DayZ to happen. Imagine if there were only shooting and door opening - such a situation would leave you with a very limited possibility for application of your creativity as designer. On the other hand user actions are also known for their not so friendly behavior like scrolling menu, issues with precision and our underlying implementation of actions on own character and others in SQF paired with old and limited animation system led to many problematic situations, to mention some, no elegant way to cancel action, spamming actions or serious ones like duping.

Renderer: I touched on this a bit during the PAX Australia presentation (and that audio/slides will be put out as soon as I get back to Prague) - Post Processes: IN PROGRESS - Water & Ocean Surfaces: IN PROGRESS - Optimization & Paralellization: IN PROGRESS Current Status: Actively under testing with internal QA We've made some great progress over the last few weeks. I prefer to manage expectations - so I'm going to say don't get too excited. Issues could pop up in QA over the next few weeks, but morale in the office regarding the renderer is getting high. I'm excited - but keep in mind we don't want it to hit experimental until we're confident in a strong -initial- performance gain. New Animation System: While we've made strong gains on this that has enabled the design team to start working on a complete rewrite of all player actions currently in game (demonstrated in the last SR) we're still working on the last few areas that -must- be completed in order to fully merge the player over to the new player controller. We'll keep you all updated on this. Infected: As we mentioned in the last Status Report - Infected will be making a return in .59 - but as covered in the PAX presentation there are changes we'd like to look into making to the infected, specifically in the area of spawning and distribution that should go miles towards a more rewarding (and scary!) experience when it comes to crawling through cities looking for gear. .59 Experimental: As of the time that I boarded my flight to PAX Aus - the last remaining major blocker towards moving this build to the exp branch was sitting specifically on vehicle position sync. It is critical we at the very least provide a more enjoyable experience with vehicles than on previous builds, especially considering the increased quantities. The gameplay programming team has been working hard on doing just this. Aside from the stuff mentioned above - we do have a few cool things to share with you guys. As those of you who watched the TwitchCon presentation, you know part of the character progression path we've been working on in addition to soft skills - is the life span of the character. Specifically shown at TwitchCon as beards for male characters. What we didn't share at the time was that we were a bit further along with this than just a few renders of male heads. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upHAL5mNH6c We still need to work on the lifespan impact for female characters - but we do have growth over time functioning on internal builds as seen in the above video. Animations for shaving still need to be completed, but the functionality for choosing to remove said beard as there as well. In the same vein as character life span - I spoke today about how the initial skill set for soft skills was functioning internally (albeit without UI elements allowing you to track said skills). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06xggXwHCdQ In the video above, we have accelerated the growth of the skillset that governs the amount of resources you gain from harvesting. (In this grim case - it happens to be a human body) The more a character performs an action that falls under this skillset, the higher yield the resources he gains from the attempt. In the accelerated video we have a character who very often skins and quarters bodies for meat, bone, and so on. As the character goes through each body, we accelerate the skill gain for the purposes of the video - but you see that with each action/attempt - the yield of meat is increased. We want to kick off the character soft skills with base skills in the areas of: Medical, Resource Gathering, Repairing. Once we see how these operate, we can expand upon them further. The little icing on the cake I like about the video is how Peter snuck a little treat in there that you can easily overlook. As the character skins and quarters the body, his hands and forearms are covered in a bloody mess. The character -can- wash this off should they go to a body of water, or have some on him. Alternatively, he or she could just as easily choose to keep this appearance. Oh! Before we move on to Peter's bit this week - Things are looking really good for the 75 player servers, I'm excited to see how it plays out on experimental. Questions? Suggestions? Make sure to head over to the official DayZ Forums and join the Status Report discussion thread for this week. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Dev Update/Peter In the last status report, there was a nice showcase of new implementations of user actions which are currently work in progress. There was an idea back in the day (and I mean it was a really long time ago, more then year and a half) about simplifying of how user actions operate and streamlining controls in general. User actions as we know them are great as they are very robust and allow usage of anything in any way you like, which leads for such a great ArmA 2 mod as DayZ to happen. Imagine if there were only shooting and door opening - such a situation would leave you with a very limited possibility for application of your creativity as designer. On the other hand user actions are also known for their not so friendly behavior like scrolling menu, issues with precision and our underlying implementation of actions on own character and others in SQF paired with old and limited animation system led to many problematic situations, to mention some, no elegant way to cancel action, spamming actions or serious ones like duping.

Also, there'll be a bit of insight on what the status is on the road going towards 0.59 on Experimental branch. Contents This Week Dev Update/Hicks Community Spotlight: GamingRoachEntertainment Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! We're going to be trying a few new things with the Status Reports from now on (from here till release). First off we're going to go ahead and move Status Reports to a two week schedule. The reason behind this is mostly due to the nature of the major tasks at hand, we're all working on larger scale tasks that impact the game as a whole. The other change I'd like to make to the Status Reports is to change the tone to a more casual and informal tone - rather than typing up the report as if we're discussing a press release, I'd like to try discussing DayZ and the ongoing changes from the perspective of one DayZ player to another. Before we get into the cool things we'd like to share with you this week, I'll get a few of the areas that are still in progress and not ready to be shown. - Renderer: As of this report the Engine team is focused on post processes and making sure that we have visual parity (making sure the visual quality is at least the same as the original renderer). Once that is done they'll be focusing on optimizations and multi threading. This will require a good amount of QA time before it hits experimental, but as we've said before - we need to have a visible improvement on performance when it hits experimental. - Infected: We're going to be spawning infected again at strong quantities in 0.59 as the gameplay programming team has been working hard on making sure we can have a smooth 75 player experience (which is looking really good guys, I'm pumped!). However! Internally we're going over some strong suggestions and ideas on how to maximize the concentration and spawning of infected across Chernarus. I don't want to speak too much on this until we have a concrete plan on how we want to handle this. Hopefully next Status Report we'll be able to cover exactly what the plan is in more detail. Needless to say, if everything works out - I'm pretty pumped about it. - Nasty 0.58 Bugs: Things like \"ground swimming\" - known duplication methods, farming of the quonset hut barracks, and such are ear marked as critical gameplay fixes for 0.59. They might not all be resolved in the first 0.59 experimental push - but they are top priority for the move to stable. First up this Status Report I thought you guys would like a brief peek at some of the audio changes coming up. Now while I mentioned a few Status Reports back that the ambience is being reworked entirely (and will be significantly quieter than the originals) I don't have anything ready to show you on that -right now-. One of the things I'm excited about gameplay wise related to that is the volume balance changes, with different shoe/boot types hopefully soon having different sound profiles, gunshots themselves will also inherently be much louder in comparison with the rest of the world. http://youtu.be/rDWuQWDo9G4 In the video up above we've put together some of the changes to weapon sounds. Sure, its not the new ambience - BUT I'm personally excited about any movements towards making each weapon have a unique audio signature so when we're all sneaking through a dense urban environment or sprinting across the wilds of Chernarus we can identify what weapon is being fired by audio alone. Some tweaks will more than likely happen before these sounds are finalized, but we wanted you guys to hear how they are sounding right now. Now lets talk about something that *really* got me excited. The other week I sat down with Peter our Lead Designer, and Honza one of our Senior Designers to check out some of the things they were working on as they get access to the larger changes we've been waiting for quite awhile on. I spoke with Break71 the other week about how we thought how silly the whole idea of being locked into an animation when performing an action was. Besides the myriad of bugs that are associated with how this works and has worked throughout the Early Access - it just felt like such an immersion and fun killer. http://youtu.be/XKI_UMuk0hs Just to be clear - the video is above is rough! However it shows what I'm talking about. The design team has significant work ahead of them rewriting every action to match with this behavior. What we're looking at is a change from an action triggering an animation and success/failure being dependent on the completion of the animation. In the example we see Senior Designer Honza (Jan) eating a test bag of rice. As he triggers the action (eating) he is holding down the assigned test key (I believe his left mouse button) his character begins eating the rice. As soon as he releases the key, the character stops eating and is free to move or perform another action. The amount of rice consumed is calculated based upon the duration of time he was eating the rice - and voila. We see a massive change in how the user interacts with the world, and performs the majority of actions and tasks within DayZ. I know I've said this a lot - but I'm excited and you should be too. Next up we have a work in progress view at how we're working on vehicle and vehicle parts damage being assigned - and the visual representation of it. I'll put a video down below. The behavior in the video is purely for test purposes. While we're happy with how each part has its own \"hit point\" value - and can be damaged/destroyed - the behavior of the part \"falling off\" of the vehicle works for some, but not necessarily for all. http://youtu.be/XZL5Tdr2PU0 We spent some time discussing how he behavior should operate today - personally while I love each part being able to be damaged individually from the parent vehicle, and that change being visual to players as they attack the vehicle I'd much rather have the part be \"non usable\" when destroyed. Such as a door that is destroyed being \"jammed\" and not openable without an action, or a tool being used to force it open. This however could easily lead to a situation where a character is \"stuck\" inside a damaged vehicle without a method of escape that looks visually acceptable (like smashing the window and being teleported out of the vehicle when climbing out of it). The design team will be going over the best method for handling the functionality of the damaged vehicle components over the course of the next week or so. I'd like to talk about that some more in the next Status Report. On the World Design side, Senchi has been working pretty tirelessly on the long awaited renovation and update to Chernogorsk. The major coastal cities for quite some time hadn't really been touched that much since we hit Early Access - and their age compared to the outstanding work the World team had done up north was really, really visible. http://i.imgur.com/ui1p5Ym.jpg http://i.imgur.com/JVrA2KR.jpg http://i.imgur.com/MvE3Vwk.jpg Now, these are still moderately early. Senchi and his team still need to replace the original Chernogorsk ground textures, and finish up the the structures - but we thought you guys would like to see how it was going.

So last weekend we were fortunate enough to be invited onto the TwitchCon stage to talk about a few upcoming things to DayZ. For those that weren't able to catch the broadcast, we're going to recap what was covered in this week’s Status Report. Before we do that - a quick recap on pending 0.59 experimental. Improvements on passenger perspective vehicle sync are still in progress Server/Client crash issues are being worked on Network Traffic Profiling tools will be pushed to certain Exp servers when the push goes out Infected Resource costs are still being worked on Bugfixing and iteration work is being done upon applying lifetime to items when they are created (initial item spawn) Contaminated Terrain When we looked at testing out the impact of terrain that requires specific equipment to safely navigate, naturally the opportunity presented itself with the upcoming Tisy Military Base, and the need to make acquiring the first Helicopter a high risk situation. Personally, I found the meeting rather exciting due to the fact that the art assets required can be added to the library used by the Environment Design team on their destruction passes aimed at making Chernarus look more post-disaster. http://i.imgur.com/a8ojdiL.jpg In the above concept art we have an example of the mass graves you would see in a last-stand military / relief hybrid camp. With the base, we're hoping to have new civilian agency hospital tents, barricades, and general signs of the last stand of the UN and CDF forces as they tried to hold off their pending death. The installation itself was originally a Surface to Air Missile & Radar base originally built by the occupying Soviets. The elevated platform you see within the frame of coursed originally used for mobile radar installations. Entering and navigating the installation should (hopefully) require using protective gear, be it the gas masks or a future hazmat suit. Else you risk a potentially fatal illness, or spreading such illness to your friends and fellow survivors. Obviously parts to support an operational helicopter will be completely separate from operational fluids and parts required to repair and maintain say.. a bus. So finding that helicopter up at Tisy definitely won't be a quick spot and grab! Aerial Vehicles http://youtu.be/evYX3WedekE Speaking of helicopters - we spoke briefly about the first aerial vehicle in DayZ at TwitchCon. The Littlebird is a model inherited from the Take On Helicopters team, and updated to meet DayZ's quality requirements. The below video is very - very rough implementation, purely keyboard controls (because I'm just that good). We'll be expanding the aerial vehicles past the Littlebird of course - current plans include expanding to fixed wing aircraft as well. (Stay tuned for that!) http://i.imgur.com/AyFSIeW.jpg For those curious, as I've mentioned several times prior - One of the mechanics we're just not satisfied with from DayZ Mod is the \"Universal Parts\" system. You could take a tire off of a bicycle and slap it on a URAL. The motor from a small fishing boat could be used in a tractor, and so on. With the introduction of new land vehicles into 0.59 we're expanding the operational parts past \"Truck Battery\" and \"Glow Plug\" - and Aerial Vehicles will see that expand as well. Specialized parts, and fuel will be required, and hopefully also see the importance of areas that naturally would contain those items be reintroduced. Character Lifespan http://i.imgur.com/odfQOF0.jpg Lastly, while at TwitchCon we had the opportunity to discuss some of the methods of character growth and progression we're working on. Specifically for TwitchCon we discussed methods of character aging, and the visual impact on the appearance of the character. Obviously females won't be growing beards, and we discussed briefly how this effect can expand past just facial hair and into scars, and dirty faces. The principle idea being allowing people to opt out of the system, and pose as someone freshly spawned. However - for those who want to go for the grizzled look, facial hair - blood, dirt, and grime can all give the appearance of a character who has seen it all. http://i.imgur.com/IT2VmjG.jpg Scars obviously however cannot just be \"washed off\" - and as we look to see how viable scars are, and if they fit within the scope of 1.0 we'll be discussing this in future status reports. Additionally, prototypes are currently being worked on for the previously described \"soft skills\" - keep your eye on future status reports for that ;) - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Igromir Expo Российские Фанаты DayZ !

The installation itself was originally a Surface to Air Missile & Radar base originally built by the occupying Soviets. The elevated platform you see within the frame of coursed originally used for mobile radar installations. Entering and navigating the installation should (hopefully) require using protective gear, be it the gas masks or a future hazmat suit. Else you risk a potentially fatal illness, or spreading such illness to your friends and fellow survivors. Obviously parts to support an operational helicopter will be completely separate from operational fluids and parts required to repair and maintain say.. a bus. So finding that helicopter up at Tisy definitely won't be a quick spot and grab! Aerial Vehicles http://youtu.be/evYX3WedekE Speaking of helicopters - we spoke briefly about the first aerial vehicle in DayZ at TwitchCon. The Littlebird is a model inherited from the Take On Helicopters team, and updated to meet DayZ's quality requirements. The below video is very - very rough implementation, purely keyboard controls (because I'm just that good). We'll be expanding the aerial vehicles past the Littlebird of course - current plans include expanding to fixed wing aircraft as well. (Stay tuned for that!) http://i.imgur.com/AyFSIeW.jpg For those curious, as I've mentioned several times prior - One of the mechanics we're just not satisfied with from DayZ Mod is the \"Universal Parts\" system. You could take a tire off of a bicycle and slap it on a URAL. The motor from a small fishing boat could be used in a tractor, and so on. With the introduction of new land vehicles into 0.59 we're expanding the operational parts past \"Truck Battery\" and \"Glow Plug\" - and Aerial Vehicles will see that expand as well. Specialized parts, and fuel will be required, and hopefully also see the importance of areas that naturally would contain those items be reintroduced. Character Lifespan http://i.imgur.com/odfQOF0.jpg Lastly, while at TwitchCon we had the opportunity to discuss some of the methods of character growth and progression we're working on. Specifically for TwitchCon we discussed methods of character aging, and the visual impact on the appearance of the character. Obviously females won't be growing beards, and we discussed briefly how this effect can expand past just facial hair and into scars, and dirty faces. The principle idea being allowing people to opt out of the system, and pose as someone freshly spawned. However - for those who want to go for the grizzled look, facial hair - blood, dirt, and grime can all give the appearance of a character who has seen it all. http://i.imgur.com/IT2VmjG.jpg Scars obviously however cannot just be \"washed off\" - and as we look to see how viable scars are, and if they fit within the scope of 1.0 we'll be discussing this in future status reports. Additionally, prototypes are currently being worked on for the previously described \"soft skills\" - keep your eye on future status reports for that ;) - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Igromir Expo Российские Фанаты DayZ !

Community Video: Hard Work So, time to take a break from the massive amounts of PvP videos and show something different. In this video, our protagonist farmer prepares a small plot, plants his tomato seeds, waters them, and peacefully awaits the moment when he can reap the sweet benefits of his back breaking work. http://youtu.be/zdpmZpTqTAk Oh, come on!!! Just let the man keep his tomato patch!!! Poor guy... Thanks for sharing haknslash. You did what you could. Keep that content coming everyone! There's plenty of room over at the Gallery.

Much to the delight of our reddit community (I'm certain) we'll be covering some points on the ongoing refinement of DayZ's in game economy this week, as well as talking about some upcoming content to the game, and a quick recap on the progress of upcoming engine changes for Enfusion. Lastly, Peter will talk briefly about future changes to how ammunition is handled in DayZ. Don't forget to keep your eyes and ears open during TwitchCon - as I'll be speaking about Aerial Transport, Contaminated Terrain, and an additional little surprise I hope you'll all be excited for as I am. (This should be hosted on twitch.tv/dayz) We've normalized the 0.58 stable branch economy around 27,000 minimum spawned items across Chernarus. The most prevalent items of course are clothes, tools, and resources required to survive. Internally we've begun setting the system up to apply lifetime to items upon their creation (spawning) so that player interaction with items is no longer required. This should take the economy a step further towards keeping things robust and moving. Region control is the next major step for the economy, which will allow us to restrict certain items to spawn only in certain regions - This way we can ensure more of those basic supplies are kept spawning on the coast to ensure folks have what is required to move inland, regardless of player traffic. For 0.59 we'll begin experimenting with making civilian firearms a little more prevalent, and ammunition will begin to be more of a rarity. The desired effect being that ammunition itself will have an increased value, so that the decision to take that shot has more factors to it. That said, loose ammunition types that are used by civilian weapons as well as military have had their potential loot spawns expanded so it can be found throughout Chernarus. (7.62x39 for the IZH, 45 ACP for the 1911, and so on) Issues with duplication, and magazine quantity manipulation have been identified and are being resolved, and NATO military gear will be moving out of the Quonset Hut Barracks and back to their proper NATO chopper crash spawns. The art team is working on finalizing the upcoming Enduro Dirtbike model, which will hopefully be joining the vehicle distribution in 0.60. This vehicle will probably be our most accessible type, but like all other vehicles will need the proper parts, and operational fluids to maintain and use. http://i.imgur.com/FRoidCX.jpg On the engine side the team is working hard towards a functional merge for several areas, keep in mind just merging these modules and systems are just the beginning. Configuration, testing, and iteration will need to occur. - Renderer has entered initial functional testing with internal Q/A - Animation System development is in progress, and the animation team is working closely with the programmers to begin testing/implementation. - Network Optimization is a top priority, with issues such as player desync, gunshot sounds, and vehicle position being tied to this work. Network profiling tools will be used on 0.59 experimental branch servers so we can gather data on exactly what is occurring. - Damage System is being configured, and under initial testing with Q/A & Design Team - Physics System has had several key issues resolved that may be related to some of the Infected AI server costs. This is under test/investigation - Infected Bugfixing is still under way, and daily test passes are being run against the commits We've got a lot of work ahead of us in the coming months, so please make sure to file any issues and bugs you see over at the Official Feedback Tracker. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Dev Update/Peter Firearms, who doesn’t like them? They equal power. One can obtain food through hunting animals, defend oneself against infected or even hostile survivors. There are firearms related mechanics which were added specifically for DayZ’s requirements such attachments, modifications, chambering and others. Also former functionality of weapons such as machine guns, rocket launchers or underslung grenade throwers will be brought back. To get closer to authenticity of firearms some changes to their handling are being currently implemented. Chambering became a real part of the weapon instead of invisible magazine with 1 bullet count. This will allow players to attach a magazine to a chambered weapon effectively increasing the amount of available bullets which wasn't possible before. Reloading is also being revamped, as R-key will be dedicated to the manipulation with weapon like manually cycling the bolt, pull back charging handle in case of jam or even rolling the drum of revolver when you decide to play lethal games with some friends. Don't worry about losing R-key for reloading. As a replacement for R-key you will be able to reload your gun directly from the quickbar by choosing the corresponding slot with magazine in it. Magazines will be swapped during reloading action. Also loose ammunition will work in same way, choose right slot and gun will be chambered. Another nice change is that bullets in magazines/piles are no more just numbers of amount but are really independent objects which means they can contain ammo of different quality. Combination of damaged ammunition and non maintained gun leads to higher possibility of jams. With different type of ammunition in magazines, tracers will experience their comeback and help us to revive night gameplay a bit. Keep your pockets organized... see you in Chernarus folks! - Peter / Lead Designer Community Spotlight: Blazerunner70 Excellent, I was lucky to stumble across a small cluster of random DayZ gems on Youtube. Yep, there's a nice mix of friendly player interaction, a bit of pvp, and a bit of roleplay. The videos were created by Blazerunner70, and although the videos are a couple of months old, they still do show the kinds of adventures that players can come across in DayZ. Now, the audio levels are a bit off but the content of the videos is quite nice still. http://youtu.be/dT6nkeD4WgA http://youtu.be/Sp_gUYvUOO0 Saving bambis, one pumpkin at a time :D http://youtu.be/5yy-0L_7aqA Hopefully you'll enjoy the videos as well, and as always, if you have some nice DayZ videos you can always go to the Gallery on the DayZ forums and share them with us.

Those of you who closely follow dev's personal twitter accounts might already know some of this information, but not everyone does - so we need to recap this. With the hotfix deployed to stable branch servers, it is important that everyone understands how the item cleanup system works - both right now, and how it should be operating with 0.59 stable. - Items have a 30 minute lifetime which can be refreshed by picking up the item, or directly interacting with it. - Base Objects (Tents, Ammo Canisters, Protector Cases, Barrels, Vehicles) have a 45 day lifetime. This will eventually move to 7 days once systems are in place for intuitive lifetime refresh - Backpacks (not including the improvised and crafted types) have a lifetime of 4 hours - Crafted backpacks have a lifetime of 1 hour When the first 0.59 experimental build hits, you'll notice a few things we'll be trying. - 10 Offroad Hatchbacks will spawn - 10 Civilian Sedans will spawn - 5 Transit Buses will spawn - 5 V3S Chassis will spawn - 3 V3S Cargo will spawn These numbers may not carry over to stable, as the intent is to test how both the server handles the amount, and the player-player vehicle position is handled. In addition, we'll be operating most servers at 75 players on 0.59 experimental. If we're able to get server side performance above the red line at 75 players prior 0.59 hitting stable, it will carry over. If not, we'll continue to work towards it with 0.60 experimental. For 0.59, and 0.60 both - we're looking at a good amount of engine work being merged into the main branch. Part of this work includes the beginning of basic QA passes against portions of the new renderer. This is internally only, but requires some DLL changes to be present in the main distribution, so don't get to worked up if you see some DLL's referencing Enfusion, or Direct X 11. Past the programmers merging these engine changes in, they still need to be properly configured within the areas of the title that use them by the design team, tested by QA, bugfixed, regression testing, and so on. So don't expect massive changes all at once (a general good approach to the whole of Early Access, in general) - and please, if you're participating in the Experimental Branch, make sure to file bugs at feedback.dayzgame.com Last Saturday we had the first Combat Scrum w/ PvP Evangelists - and we've compiled the rough notes of what was covered in this below: Attending: Brian Hicks xSmak Respawnonme iwinuloselol DeadlySlob M1NDR Break71 This initial combat scrum ran a whopping two hours, and bounced over a myriad of topics. We're looking into the possibility of moving to releasing these as audio MP3s in the future. For this scrum we'll cover the top four questions and their responses. 1) Player Desync / Gunshots not being heard / Breaking your legs while climbing upstairs? A) While server side performance gains were made, this exponentially grew the amount of successful network traffic being handled by the server. No optimizations have been done on this across 2015, and thus obviously has to be a priority moving forward. This is a well known issue internally, and will be a focus moving forward. Network traffic behavior is just not acceptable right now, and must be improved. 2) Improvised Bow - Balancing? Changing the aiming style? Improving usability? A) Obviously, the current method of using the improvised bow in combat is not ideal. It is -functional- but we have a good ways to go with it until we're happy. Most of that is either A) Going to be affected by upcoming changes to the animation system, and player controller and B) Going to come in beta, when our focus shifts from primarily feature development, to bug fixing. In short, in the end - we most definitely want bow combat to be both viable, and rewarding. 3) Weapon Sway / Realism vs Fun / Using the effect of hold breath to mitigate the cost of weapon sway & stamina? A) This is a good point. Obviously DayZ is known for, and associated with a \"hardcore unforgiving survival simulator\" - and we want to maintain this moving forward. However, when it comes to systems such as weapon sway, hold breath, and stamina - and how they all play into each other, we need to communicate more clearly to the user exactly what is going on. Part of this can be communicated properly via the upcoming new (togglable) UI, and even more can be communicated by -properly- displaying a (more) visible change in sway via the hold breath mechanic. As we're currently using placeholder tech from RV in this area, we're not able to do what we want to do with this. As we move closer to beta, we're all excited to move weapon sway, and associated hold breath functionality and the new UI towards a more approachable and understandable system. Much like learning to control your sound in DayZ Mod, we hope to see players learning through UI and visual cues how to control their weapon sway, and use hold breath the most effectively. 4) Are there any plans to reduce player speed / Address some sort of inertia system to mitigate players being able to make high speed 180 turns without consequence? A) Firstly with player speed, anyone who played DayZ Mod can tell you how ridiculously fast the DayZ player speed is in comparison. Initially this was done to help mitigate the limited available methods of transportation in DayZ, as Chernarus is a very, very large play area - and the decentralization of points of interest by expanding and redesigning Chernarus into Chernarus Plus meant much more travel was needed. As we look forwards towards 0.59 and beyond, increasing the methods and availability of transportation we'll be scaling back player movement speed (iteratively, not all at once). When it comes to inertia, dexterity, and all of the potential gameplay areas that can have an impact on the player movement, there is most certainly room for improvement. Keep in mind however, we can't start effectively implementing and changing how this works in game until both the new player controller, and animation system are merged in and configured for use by the design team. That said, we are most definitely interested in improving how the player handles, and expanding the simulation of weight, and dexterity upon the momentum of player characters in motion. The next three months or so should see some marked improvement, and changes to how this is handled. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer For the full Status Report, please use the following link to the Devhub",

A) While server side performance gains were made, this exponentially grew the amount of successful network traffic being handled by the server. No optimizations have been done on this across 2015, and thus obviously has to be a priority moving forward. This is a well known issue internally, and will be a focus moving forward. Network traffic behavior is just not acceptable right now, and must be improved. 2) Improvised Bow - Balancing? Changing the aiming style? Improving usability? A) Obviously, the current method of using the improvised bow in combat is not ideal. It is -functional- but we have a good ways to go with it until we're happy. Most of that is either A) Going to be affected by upcoming changes to the animation system, and player controller and B) Going to come in beta, when our focus shifts from primarily feature development, to bug fixing. In short, in the end - we most definitely want bow combat to be both viable, and rewarding. 3) Weapon Sway / Realism vs Fun / Using the effect of hold breath to mitigate the cost of weapon sway & stamina? A) This is a good point. Obviously DayZ is known for, and associated with a \"hardcore unforgiving survival simulator\" - and we want to maintain this moving forward. However, when it comes to systems such as weapon sway, hold breath, and stamina - and how they all play into each other, we need to communicate more clearly to the user exactly what is going on. Part of this can be communicated properly via the upcoming new (togglable) UI, and even more can be communicated by -properly- displaying a (more) visible change in sway via the hold breath mechanic. As we're currently using placeholder tech from RV in this area, we're not able to do what we want to do with this. As we move closer to beta, we're all excited to move weapon sway, and associated hold breath functionality and the new UI towards a more approachable and understandable system. Much like learning to control your sound in DayZ Mod, we hope to see players learning through UI and visual cues how to control their weapon sway, and use hold breath the most effectively. 4) Are there any plans to reduce player speed / Address some sort of inertia system to mitigate players being able to make high speed 180 turns without consequence? A) Firstly with player speed, anyone who played DayZ Mod can tell you how ridiculously fast the DayZ player speed is in comparison. Initially this was done to help mitigate the limited available methods of transportation in DayZ, as Chernarus is a very, very large play area - and the decentralization of points of interest by expanding and redesigning Chernarus into Chernarus Plus meant much more travel was needed. As we look forwards towards 0.59 and beyond, increasing the methods and availability of transportation we'll be scaling back player movement speed (iteratively, not all at once). When it comes to inertia, dexterity, and all of the potential gameplay areas that can have an impact on the player movement, there is most certainly room for improvement. Keep in mind however, we can't start effectively implementing and changing how this works in game until both the new player controller, and animation system are merged in and configured for use by the design team. That said, we are most definitely interested in improving how the player handles, and expanding the simulation of weight, and dexterity upon the momentum of player characters in motion. The next three months or so should see some marked improvement, and changes to how this is handled. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer For the full Status Report, please use the following link to the Devhub",

While in Seattle for the Penny Arcade Expo I spent a good amount of time live casting from both the Twitch, and Astro stages.

Now that 0.58 has hit stable, we've been keeping an eye on the Official Forums and Feedback Tracker. Huge thanks to all of you who were exemplary testers and filed outstanding tickets giving us strong repros on the critical issues not caught on experimental. In addition to the known issues, the community helped us identify issues with the cleanup of certain items (eg: some firearms, etc). Internally, while development on 0.59 is ongoing - a small portion of the team has forked off to work on a potential hotfix for 0.58 Stable addressing: - Session Lost / Connection Issues when around large/medium player camps - Certain items not being cleaned up by Lifetime (Age) cleanup Once we have a build we feel is ready for larger testing, it will be pushed to the Experimental Branch. The build will have to check out after a minimum of 2 days testing - and then will be eligible for a push to Stable. (Cross your fingers!) As 0.58 Stable continues, we've closely monitored loot saturation and dispersal. The average operating range for item quantity as of the time of the launch of 0.58 was approximately 21,000 items. With the initial release, iteration and configuration was still needed on a good deal of items within the central economy control. Below, you'll see the dispersion of items three days after the launch of 0.58 to stable. (Public server, High population) http://i.imgur.com/K6rGRLg.jpg Several days ago, we completed a gradual configuration and increase of loot quantity. Tools, clothing, survival resources, and such were increased incrementally - bringing the average resting quantity of loot across Chernarus to 26,000 items. Weapons, non perishable food, and military gear retained their configured numbers from Experimental Branch. We'll continue to iterate this as 0.58 is ongoing, and the pending hotfix addressing the cleanup of specific items will continue to make the survival experience in Chernarus engaging. With TwitchCon coming up at the end of this month in San Francisco, we're looking forward to talking about Aerial Transport, Contaminated Terrain, and more - so be on the lookout for specific information on when/where to watch that! Lastly, this weekend we will be trying out our first Community Combat Scrum. We've extended invitations to the first evangelists we'll be trialing the program with. The following community members will be joining us this weekend: Break71 xSmak Deadly Slob Respawnonme M1NDR IwinUloseLOL The results of the scrum will be included in next weeks Status Report, and assuming the program results are positive we'll start looking into expanding it to evangelists of the Survivalist type gameplay as well. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer ",

        "contents": "Evening survivors, As we're at the edges of releasing 0.58 on Stable branch, our Lead Producer Brian Hicks has a couple of words to share regarding what to expect and keep an eye out for once the build is deployed. Additionally, he'll also have a bit of info available for the upcoming PAX Prime convention which will take place over the next weekend (Aug 28-31) in Seattle. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Pax Prime 2015 Schedule Community Spotlight: MAVE Development Board Spotlight http://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/55841b966c7e5fde3eed43f0/3135x900/3dd7a5aa5a632f9675ec38ddcd6b95f4/radiostation.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! At the time of this writing we're hours away from this weeks Stable Branch maintenance period, in which 0.58 will move to stable branch - and work will kick off on 0.59. That said - there are a few things we'd like you all to know. - First off, if you are a server renter - make sure to familiarize yourself with the updated server rules: Public server hosting rules, Private server hosting rules. - There will be a full reset of the characters, items, and server storage when this update goes live. - Adjustments will need to be made to how the Central Economy functions within the live environment. If you notice something out of the ordinary - open a ticket at feedback.dayzgame.com to let us know! While many QoL (Quality of Life) issues were resolved with 0.58, we're still in development of both DayZ, and the Enfusion engine - so there are plenty of issues remaining to get fixed. Be aware of these, so you may best enjoy your time participating in DayZ's development. - Door States are currently experiencing issues. In these situations, sometimes players can hear the sounds of doors opening/closing that might not actually be being interacted with. - Cooked Meat can in some cases cause survivors to become ill. - Server / Client position tracking improvements are still being worked on. In some cases, desynchronization of this information can occur and server/client or client/client disagreements will happen. - While the long running animation state problem of survivors constantly shouldering weapons seems to have been slain, we still have some edge cases where odd animation state behavior can be observed. - There are a few low repro server crashes still present, the frequency of these are fairly low and investigation on repro steps is ongoing. - Passenger Vehicle Position desynchronization is still below acceptable, and is slated for priority work on 0.59. - In some cases, while manipulating your inventory or crafting certain items a \"false duplicate\" item can be created. While this issue is currently under investigation, players can mitigate this by logging out and back in. - In some situations, all clients involved in a gunfight will not receive all proper gunshot sounds. This is currently being investigated. - Player camps of large size may experience issues interacting with and manipulating items. Survivors are encouraged to spread out camps of large size (2+ tents) until this issue is resolved. With 0.58 Stable Update incoming, and PAX Prime just around the corner it should be an exciting weekend.

Both short films created by MAVE are great examples of what the many excellent content creators are able and willing to produce in their spare time.

Additionally, he'll also have a bit of info available for the upcoming PAX Prime convention which will take place over the next weekend (Aug 28-31) in Seattle. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Pax Prime 2015 Schedule Community Spotlight: MAVE Development Board Spotlight http://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/55841b966c7e5fde3eed43f0/3135x900/3dd7a5aa5a632f9675ec38ddcd6b95f4/radiostation.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! At the time of this writing we're hours away from this weeks Stable Branch maintenance period, in which 0.58 will move to stable branch - and work will kick off on 0.59. That said - there are a few things we'd like you all to know. - First off, if you are a server renter - make sure to familiarize yourself with the updated server rules: Public server hosting rules, Private server hosting rules. - There will be a full reset of the characters, items, and server storage when this update goes live. - Adjustments will need to be made to how the Central Economy functions within the live environment. If you notice something out of the ordinary - open a ticket at feedback.dayzgame.com to let us know! While many QoL (Quality of Life) issues were resolved with 0.58, we're still in development of both DayZ, and the Enfusion engine - so there are plenty of issues remaining to get fixed. Be aware of these, so you may best enjoy your time participating in DayZ's development. - Door States are currently experiencing issues. In these situations, sometimes players can hear the sounds of doors opening/closing that might not actually be being interacted with. - Cooked Meat can in some cases cause survivors to become ill. - Server / Client position tracking improvements are still being worked on. In some cases, desynchronization of this information can occur and server/client or client/client disagreements will happen. - While the long running animation state problem of survivors constantly shouldering weapons seems to have been slain, we still have some edge cases where odd animation state behavior can be observed. - There are a few low repro server crashes still present, the frequency of these are fairly low and investigation on repro steps is ongoing. - Passenger Vehicle Position desynchronization is still below acceptable, and is slated for priority work on 0.59. - In some cases, while manipulating your inventory or crafting certain items a \"false duplicate\" item can be created. While this issue is currently under investigation, players can mitigate this by logging out and back in. - In some situations, all clients involved in a gunfight will not receive all proper gunshot sounds. This is currently being investigated. - Player camps of large size may experience issues interacting with and manipulating items. Survivors are encouraged to spread out camps of large size (2+ tents) until this issue is resolved. With 0.58 Stable Update incoming, and PAX Prime just around the corner it should be an exciting weekend. We'll be covering some exiting new changes and additions to the developer-community interaction in three different areas on the Twitch.tv stage, doing Developer Meet & Greets, and talking DayZ Story Telling.

Additionally, he'll tell us a bit about what will be in focus for 0.59 Experimental once we progress past 0.58 release on Stable branch. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Community Video: \"The Chronicles of 0.58\" Development Board Spotlight http://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/55841b966c7e5fde3eed43f0/1215x966/7bfd7de8ea7662aaf85a413fdc3b827b/2wayRadio.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! Much like the last Status Report - we've still got the gameplay programming team working on the blocking issues preventing 0.58 to hit stable branch. The primary issues of which were a result of some tests on resolving animation looping, and related problems we are still aiming for 0.59 to address. We've been working hard to resolve these issues so we can provide as compelling a gameplay experience w/ 0.58 as possible while still in development. Once 0.58 leaves incubation on experimental branch, survivors will notice a sharp difference in how loot is distributed across Chernarus. We're still pretty early on in where we want to be with the central economy by release from Early Access, however we do now have much more precise control over the distribution. The system allows us to dynamically modify quantities, spawning frequencies, spawning priority, and so on without having to push an update to stable branch. We'll be closely monitoring active item concentration across official servers, and adjusting based upon this. Those more stalwart survivors might notice higher quantities of canned food goods than are specifically required - we've found that the best method to acclimate players to having to scavenge for supplies versus the placeholder prototype systems distribution is to slowly dial the quantities incrementally down - until the balance reaches a playable state. http://i.imgur.com/1vrgeJl.png Above you can see the current top 10 distributed items on an example experimental branch server. Non persishable food currently has the highest priority / quantity for entry level items in the respawn system. Primarily to allow folks to acclimate themselves to the need to move *around* Chernarus to continue to find the supplies they need. Ideally, we'll dial these quantities back in increments of 10 until we find a comfortable balance. Past non perishable goods, basic tools have the highest quantity of items spread across Chernarus. Wood Axes, Matches, Burlap Sacks, Water Purification, and so on. http://i.imgur.com/wnX85fA.png Again, once 0.58 stable hits and has time to settle - with a larger player base than experimental roaming across the environment we'll make changes according to how the distribution looks and performs. Moving past 0.58 and looking at 0.59 experimental - in addition to the new features, content, and so forth - We'll be looking into more QoL improvements for the stable player base. Vehicle position sync optimization (no fun riding around in new vehicles if your passengers want to vomit from desync!), animation state sync between clients, animal herd behaviour, position & projectile synchronization bugfixing, and much more. As well, with 0.59 experimental we'll be testing the potential effect of players spawning with radios and how it may or may not impact player interaction. The range of the radios should be temporarily (for the duration of the test on Exp 0.59) increased to cover the whole of Chernarus. Once this hits experimental, I encourage you to head over to the official DayZ forums (forums.dayzgame.com) and share your experiences (be it good, or bad) with how this impacts your gameplay! As mentioned during our RTX panel presentation, longer incubation times on Experimental and dedicating more time to QoL issues on the primary branch may end up costing us some time here or there, but we firmly believe it will present a higher quality player experience during DayZ's development. Of course, there will still be plenty of bugs - but we'll do our best to make sure the experience is still enjoyable. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Community Video: \"The Chronicles of 0.58\" This time around we present you with a series of videos called \"The Chronicles of 0.58\" created by: http://i.imgur.com/z377rTn.png The 5 episode series chronicles a 10 hour session Mr. Blackout completed together with Brian Hicks. During the session, the duo showcase playability in version 0.58 which is available on our Experimental branch servers. While the guys embark on their trek through Chernarus, the guys show their looting, friendly encounters, hostile encounters (where Hicks assists Blackout by soaking bullets like a sponge, hardcore MLG style), and all that good stuff. http://youtu.be/3t2FrrQmTFc http://youtu.be/hR4ZNUEMSxQ http://youtu.be/nrxJmagIexM http://youtu.be/-zYNKcdqpbc http://youtu.be/zi15CCaF5Fw At the end of the series, some 1,5+ hours had passed by without me really noticing, so if you have the time I'd definitely recommend you having a go at the episodes. Quite impressive that Mr. Blackout managed to go through a 10 hour session that included hostile encounters without even dying once. If you find yourselves hungry for more from Mr. Blackout, you can find tons more content via his Youtube account, you can watch his streams via his Twitch account, and you can contact him via Twitter and Facebook. As always, if you have a nice video containing DayZ footage you'd like to share, or if you have come across some DayZ footage from other content creators, just post it in the Gallery section of the DayZ forums and we'll happily have a look.

In this regard he'll go over subjects such as the loot distribution and persistence. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Community Video: I'M HUNTING Development Board Spotlight http://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/555c75e68fcfd37a0efc67bf/1920x1080/2bf654edb3f5a7f8e1284a28c61a7394/2015-07-10_00009.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! The team has been crunching away on our last blockers for stable release, as well as working on values for loot distribution. Tomorrow morning we should see our (hopeful) final experimental release hit Steam, which will be tested over the weekend. Assuming we notice no new issues, we're hoping to hit stable branch on Monday or Tuesday next week. The only issue we currently see as a blocker on experimental (0.58.128852) is visually represented as \"floating loot\" currently caused by an issue with items that have been \"swapped\" by players. (Most commonly seen as loot floating above deer stands, police stations, etc). As mentioned above, tomorrow should see an experimental push that will see this resolved - and this build will be tested over the weekend to see its viability for Stable Branch. http://i.imgur.com/ohcuNsP.jpg While this fix has been underway, we've been dialing in the balance for non perishable food, firearms, and military loot. Currently, the highest quantity and priority in the economy is given to non perishable food goods. (Tuna, Beans, Rice, etc). With civilian pistols being the most common firearm, followed by civilian rifles such as the trumpet, blaze, IZH43 Shotgun, and so on. Military loot is distributed across all military points across the map, mostly of which are up in the Northern areas. Military grade firearms are relatively rare, and there is no guarantee that visiting the military bases will yield you the weapon you want. With most items on a 30 minute timer (without being \"refreshed\" by being manipulated by players) - getting fully kitted up as a \"military\" player with all the gear you want could take some time. Super Rare items (M4A1, Steyr Aug, SVD, and so on) that spawn on dynamic events operate on an even rarer chance. Dynamic events have a varied pool of potential items that can spawn, with only 3 active helicopter wrecks at any given time - and an approximate 4 hour clean up, continued hunting will be required to find that super rare weapon or item you are seeking. Please keep in mind, we are now fully able to update quantities and rarity without requiring an update - so if we should see issues with loot concentration, or quantity once .58 hits stable branch, we will be able to address this rapidly. Fortunately, players can now create camps and store their supplies and weapons at them during their treks across Chernarus. Different containers / objects have different lifetimes. Currently, they operate as follows: - Medium Tent (Pitched): 45 Days - Military Tent (Pitched): 45 Days - Car Tent (Pitched): 45 Days - Barrels: 45 Days - Ammo Boxes: 45 Days - Protector Cases: 45 Days - Backpacks (All types): 3 Days Current functionality on experimental does not allow for refreshing the lifetime of an object without picking it up, so tents and barrels were set to a lifetime that will cover the time to .59 + some safety room in case of .59 stable blockers. Once .59 is pushed to stable, we will support the refresh of a base objects lifetime via interacting with it (moving, placing, picking up any item inside it) - which will operate as follows: - Medium Tent (Pitched): 7 Days - Military Tent (Pitched): 7 Days - Car Tent (Pitched): 7 Days - Barrels: 7 Days - Ammo Boxes: 7 Days - Protector Cases: 7 Days - Backpacks (All types): 3 Days This system will also allow for the refreshing of advanced basebuilding objects, once they are implemented. Speaking of advanced base building - I'll be speaking at RTX 2015 in Austin, Texas on Saturday, August 8th at 5:30 PM to discuss a recap of things covered at E3 2015, what we'd like to do with advanced base building, what soft skills means exactly, and show the new vehicles coming in 0.59. For those unable to make it, we'll be providing the presentation + audio in the Status Report following the event (Wednesday, August 12th). - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Community Video: I'M HUNTING Hey survivors, While looking for some videos of players doing some hunting and fishing while living the hermit lifestyle in Chernarus, I came across a video simply called \"I'M HUNTING\". I could see in the description that it was probably not exactly what I was looking for, but I decided to give it a go just the same. Sure enough, the content didn't disappoint. In the video we get to see a glimpse of the unjust killing of a freshspawn and the subsequent hunt and sweet, sweet revenge towards the end. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugltJ8y8A2o The video was brought to us by the following content creator: Musse Plays As always, if you have a nice video containing DayZ footage you'd like to share, or if you have come across some DayZ footage from other content creators, just post it in the Gallery section of the DayZ forums and we'll happily have a look.

In this regard he'll go over subjects such as the loot distribution and persistence. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Community Video: I'M HUNTING Development Board Spotlight http://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/555c75e68fcfd37a0efc67bf/1920x1080/2bf654edb3f5a7f8e1284a28c61a7394/2015-07-10_00009.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! The team has been crunching away on our last blockers for stable release, as well as working on values for loot distribution. Tomorrow morning we should see our (hopeful) final experimental release hit Steam, which will be tested over the weekend. Assuming we notice no new issues, we're hoping to hit stable branch on Monday or Tuesday next week. The only issue we currently see as a blocker on experimental (0.58.128852) is visually represented as \"floating loot\" currently caused by an issue with items that have been \"swapped\" by players. (Most commonly seen as loot floating above deer stands, police stations, etc). As mentioned above, tomorrow should see an experimental push that will see this resolved - and this build will be tested over the weekend to see its viability for Stable Branch. http://i.imgur.com/ohcuNsP.jpg While this fix has been underway, we've been dialing in the balance for non perishable food, firearms, and military loot. Currently, the highest quantity and priority in the economy is given to non perishable food goods. (Tuna, Beans, Rice, etc). With civilian pistols being the most common firearm, followed by civilian rifles such as the trumpet, blaze, IZH43 Shotgun, and so on. Military loot is distributed across all military points across the map, mostly of which are up in the Northern areas. Military grade firearms are relatively rare, and there is no guarantee that visiting the military bases will yield you the weapon you want. With most items on a 30 minute timer (without being \"refreshed\" by being manipulated by players) - getting fully kitted up as a \"military\" player with all the gear you want could take some time.

Our Lead Producer Brian Hicks will be talking a bit about what the team has been working as of late in regards to persistence, and also, he will fill us in a bit in relation to both server performance as well as player position desync. Also, Lead Designer Peter Nespesny will inform us of the work being conducted on vehicles. This includes both upcoming vehicles as well as operation/maintenance of these.

Last we discussed: - Server Performance (Degrading) This issue has been resolved, and we're seeing a 3x increase in server performance on the current 0.58. As well, the degrading curve of server performance over large spans of time has been resolved. Thus, the experimental branch servers will be operating on a 12 hour restart schedule now. - Player Position Desync Still being worked on, the gameplay programmers have made some improvements on this issue - but its still not where we would like it to be for stable. We'll continue to iterate on this, and keep you apprised in the Status Reports. For now, current experimental servers should show a marked improvement in this area. Now onto the meat for this week. As frequent experimental branch users are aware, we've been operating experimental with full persistence enabled. Dynamic events have been respawning, and cleaning up - and we've been conducting extensive testing on Quantity Maximum Cleanup, and Lifetime Cleanup. http://i.imgur.com/hKoxVRq.jpg The above picture shows the loot concentration (against a black backdrop for our color blind users) right after last Friday's experimental update. The item quantity sits right around an average of 21,000 items globally. http://i.imgur.com/fXogy2o.jpg This picture, shows the same server - 3 days later. The item quantity is *the same* (Approx 21,000 items globally) but the saturation is much lower, with the items massively spread out across the map. This issue can be tied to two issues - One, lifetime (age of a particular item) cleanup not functioning for items \"dropped\" on the ground - and per building maximum not yet functioning. Todays experimental build is aimed at resolving both of those issues. With the first iteration of per-building maximums, and bug fixing on item lifetime cleanup, we'll be monitoring the loot heat maps - as well as aiming for another experimental update tomorrow (assuming everything works out alright) with point-of-interest structure limits. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Dev Update/Peter Transportation in DayZ is a crucial part of gameplay, especially on such a large landscape as Chernarus offers. Whenever you want to reach inland for a higher chance to find better loot, get to the Chernogorsk hospital for medical supplies to help your friend in need or ambush the bandit camp hidden in the woods - hiking is the least viable option. As you want to reach your goal as fast as possible, you find yourself looking for the vehicle which suits your current needs best. Version 0.59 will come with a big update to vehicles content and I'm happy to see it's shaping up pretty well. You can look forward to a car fest with 3 completely new vehicles made from scratch just for DayZ including a slick sedan, a sturdy off-road and a spacious bus. All of these vehicles will have different handling characteristics and specifications you can experience in real life for example bigger turning radius and slower acceleration of the bus, higher top speeds of the sedan or perfect contact with uneven surfaces of off-road. Apart from that as I mention earlier we are adding long awaited vehicle parts. To repair and maintain your vehicle you will also need to utilize a broad spectrum of tools already available in game, may it be the lug wrench for mounting the wheels, screwdriver to attach the doors or wrench to connect the battery. Some of the tools will have specialized purposes like the lug wrench while others will be used for more interactions within vehicle and its parts. I want to see characters using their tools directly from hands interacting with the exposed parts of the vehicle to reinforce the visceral experience of actual activity. All vehicles and their parts were designed, modeled and prepared according to this goal so I hope it will turn out really well and adds to more sophisticated gameplay instead of instant abstract actions. I will end my part of Status Report in a bit hyped spirit with insight into the future where I can see vehicles like helicopters, planes, boats and bikes. (Of course we're doing bicycles!). Keep those tools handy... see you in Chernarus folks! Peter Nespesny / Lead Designer Community Video: Epic Melee Fight Yay!!!

        "contents": "Greetings Survivors, Yet another week is checked off the calendar as the team moves forward with development of DayZ. In this week's Status Report, Lead Producer Brian Hicks will be filling us in on the challenges the team faces while on the road towards the next Stable branch update. Additionally, Brian will hand out a bit more info/updates in regards to the current state of persistence on 0.58 over on the Experimental branch. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Community Spotlight: Carrot Survivor Development Board Spotlight http://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/55a549a222bb191211fb70bc/1862x1121/7cba7a09153d8395380ec1bf56bf7f6e/DayZnewVehicles.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! As we're in crunch to resolve the last few blocking issues for 0.58 we don't have too much *new news*. That said, we'll use this weeks Status Report to fill you in on the issues we're currently focused on resolving for 0.58, as well as some small changes to Experimental Branch over the last week. Player Position Desync: This issue has been present in a pretty bad state on 0.57, so obviously we want to do what we can to improve the situation for 0.58. No one enjoys having their character get stuck in one spot, or have someone they're in conflict with bounce all over their screen. While we'll probably not get this issue 100% resolved for this update, our aim is to mitigate it as much as possible and present as enjoyable an experience on stable branch as is possible within a reasonable amount of time for bugfixing. We'll be pushing test updates to experimental branch as work on this moves forward. Degrading Server Performance: Internally we have noticed severe performance drops on 0.58 experimental, below what we consider to be the acceptable line for a playable dev build. The team has focused on investigating the cause of this issue, and resolving it so as to return the build to a playable state. This, like the issue with player position desync is marked as a blocker for 0.58 stable release. As well, we discussed last week the goal of having the gameplay programmers resolve the issue of animation glitching for 0.58. With the issues listed above, specifically player position desynchronization being a much more critical issue - priority on the animation glitching (weapon swapping, holding an invisible weapon) has been rescheduled for 0.59, in order to give the proper resources to resolving the issues listed above. That said - with 0.58 large strides have been made on the loot respawning, and cleanup issues. Allowing us to look forward to the reintroduction of persistent objects frequently used with the building of player camps. The following functionality is currently present on 0.58 persistence: Vehicle Position Vehicle Inventory Attached Vehicle Parts (W/ Exception to Tires & Fuel Levels) Barrel Locations & Inventory Horticulture Plots Fireplaces & Ovens Tents (Camping, Military, Car) Locations & Inventory Containers (Ammo Canisters, Backpacks, etc) And of course - the base item persistence is functioning as well. Item cleanup & respawn should ensure that the economy functions at a base enjoyable level. If you encounter or spawn near a small village that seems to be barren, just continue on to the next town. Mapping the concentration of loot over the span of a week on experimental has shown proper saturation across the map, so there is a high chance that the next town will have everything you need! As well, Lead Designer Peter Nespesny will be discussing our goals for vehicle maintenance (tools, parts, etc) on the Official DayZ forums later today. Make sure to head over, and let your voice be heard! Lastly, as we look to pushing 0.58 to Stable Branch - We'll be issuing a full reset of the hive (private shard and public shard characters) as well as a full wipe of existing persistence. We still have a long way to go, but 0.58 should be a fun build to play on - and 0.59 looks to be even better! - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Community Spotlight: Carrot Survivor Hey all, So, for this week it is time yet again for one of the DayZ content creators that have a mixed bag of goodies in his library. Without too much fuss; for this week we'll present you a couple of the videos created by: Carrot Survivor Ahhh, the sweet sweet randomness when players take off into Chernarus to meet and engage other players sometimes in dialogue, sometimes in firefights. Our small selection of Carrot Survivor's videos depict the following settings: 1. An encounter where Carrot Survivor hooks up with two other random players. Eventually the group takes fire, and the guys subsequently have to figure out a way to deal with a pair of less than friendly players situated by the docks in Cherno. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYi1ci7qhhE 2. An unusual encouter where Carrot and a friend engage in a firefight with another player by Veresnik military base.

        "contents": "Greetings Survivors, Yet another week is checked off the calendar as the team moves forward with development of DayZ. In this week's Status Report, Lead Producer Brian Hicks will be filling us in on the challenges the team faces while on the road towards the next Stable branch update. Additionally, Brian will hand out a bit more info/updates in regards to the current state of persistence on 0.58 over on the Experimental branch. Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Community Spotlight: Carrot Survivor Development Board Spotlight http://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/55a549a222bb191211fb70bc/1862x1121/7cba7a09153d8395380ec1bf56bf7f6e/DayZnewVehicles.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors! As we're in crunch to resolve the last few blocking issues for 0.58 we don't have too much *new news*. That said, we'll use this weeks Status Report to fill you in on the issues we're currently focused on resolving for 0.58, as well as some small changes to Experimental Branch over the last week. Player Position Desync: This issue has been present in a pretty bad state on 0.57, so obviously we want to do what we can to improve the situation for 0.58. No one enjoys having their character get stuck in one spot, or have someone they're in conflict with bounce all over their screen. While we'll probably not get this issue 100% resolved for this update, our aim is to mitigate it as much as possible and present as enjoyable an experience on stable branch as is possible within a reasonable amount of time for bugfixing. We'll be pushing test updates to experimental branch as work on this moves forward. Degrading Server Performance: Internally we have noticed severe performance drops on 0.58 experimental, below what we consider to be the acceptable line for a playable dev build. The team has focused on investigating the cause of this issue, and resolving it so as to return the build to a playable state. This, like the issue with player position desync is marked as a blocker for 0.58 stable release. As well, we discussed last week the goal of having the gameplay programmers resolve the issue of animation glitching for 0.58. With the issues listed above, specifically player position desynchronization being a much more critical issue - priority on the animation glitching (weapon swapping, holding an invisible weapon) has been rescheduled for 0.59, in order to give the proper resources to resolving the issues listed above. That said - with 0.58 large strides have been made on the loot respawning, and cleanup issues. Allowing us to look forward to the reintroduction of persistent objects frequently used with the building of player camps. The following functionality is currently present on 0.58 persistence: Vehicle Position Vehicle Inventory Attached Vehicle Parts (W/ Exception to Tires & Fuel Levels) Barrel Locations & Inventory Horticulture Plots Fireplaces & Ovens Tents (Camping, Military, Car) Locations & Inventory Containers (Ammo Canisters, Backpacks, etc) And of course - the base item persistence is functioning as well. Item cleanup & respawn should ensure that the economy functions at a base enjoyable level. If you encounter or spawn near a small village that seems to be barren, just continue on to the next town. Mapping the concentration of loot over the span of a week on experimental has shown proper saturation across the map, so there is a high chance that the next town will have everything you need! As well, Lead Designer Peter Nespesny will be discussing our goals for vehicle maintenance (tools, parts, etc) on the Official DayZ forums later today. Make sure to head over, and let your voice be heard! Lastly, as we look to pushing 0.58 to Stable Branch - We'll be issuing a full reset of the hive (private shard and public shard characters) as well as a full wipe of existing persistence. We still have a long way to go, but 0.58 should be a fun build to play on - and 0.59 looks to be even better! - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Community Spotlight: Carrot Survivor Hey all, So, for this week it is time yet again for one of the DayZ content creators that have a mixed bag of goodies in his library. Without too much fuss; for this week we'll present you a couple of the videos created by: Carrot Survivor Ahhh, the sweet sweet randomness when players take off into Chernarus to meet and engage other players sometimes in dialogue, sometimes in firefights. Our small selection of Carrot Survivor's videos depict the following settings: 1. An encounter where Carrot Survivor hooks up with two other random players. Eventually the group takes fire, and the guys subsequently have to figure out a way to deal with a pair of less than friendly players situated by the docks in Cherno. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYi1ci7qhhE 2. An unusual encouter where Carrot and a friend engage in a firefight with another player by Veresnik military base. They end up taking the player hostage, yet the encounter ends in a way you might not necessarily expect: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4REuxp2Ywi8 3. Yet another hostile encounter where things do not go entirely quite as planned, neither for Carrot Survivor nor for his aggressor (dear god, Carrot's screaming is used liberally in several videos and it cracks me up every single time): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQF4T2iKrjs As always, if interested in more, please feel free to follow Carrot Survivor via his Twitter and Youtube accounts: Twitter Youtube Also, for this month we have an update on the bugfiler(s) for the month of june.

Once 0.58 goes live, we can start discussing 0.59 plans and intent. http://i.imgur.com/pQAosHw.jpg Guardhouse Buildings: As work is underway on regional control over the central loot economy, in the interim the guardhouse structures spread across the entirety of the map will not be spawning any loot. This is done to preserve the restriction of high end military loot to the military bases and camps inland in Chernarus. The structures themselves remain enter-able, but until regional control is implemented on stable branch - they will remain without spawning loot. http://i.imgur.com/aef98Qv.jpg Land_Mil_House The structure some folks have referred to as the \"Camo Building\" or the \"Jail House\" has been problematic for some time. We've issued hotfixes, and addressed several bugs related to it - but the core issue that needs to be addressed is on the player controller. Rather than continue to issue small hotfixes (otherwise known as bandages on a broken leg) the issue needs to be resolved at the cause. To that end, the loot that would normally be spawning within these structures will be redistributed to other military buildings (tents, camps, barracks, etc) \"Ghost Sounds\" Those who have played DayZ throughout its Early Access development are probably no stranger to the notorious \"ghost sounds\" bug. Splitting ammo, bandaging, opening soda cans, etc being partially played, and well outside of the range of the actual sound effect. Fortunately, during 0.58 development we were able to get some of the gameplay programmers time to look into this issue, and we are now confident that on 0.58 the issue has been finally slain. So be very aware after the next stable update, if you *hear* a sound effect playing - it IS near you. Be careful out there! http://i.imgur.com/iTOg9f8.jpg Wrecks (Non interactive) With work on the central loot economy continuing, and the functionality of how it operates being iterated upon - Non interactive wrecks (tanks, destroyed UAZ's, etc) have been removed from the loot spawning tables, and the environment team will begin using them in their \"devastation passes\" across Chernarus. As with other structures, items that would normally spawn there will be redistributed across Chernarus. Note: This does NOT include interactive wrecks, such as vehicles you can open the trunks/doors/etc on. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saPzTka4KnU Animation Glitching The gameplay programming team is currently investigating the cause and symptom behind the notorious animation glitching bug. (Weapon swapping constantly) As well as the issues with dropping your weapon when vaulting. The weapon vaulting fix should be coming to experimental soon, and it is the aim of the team internally to also include a fix toward the weapon swapping animation bug. http://i.imgur.com/tCfL3Sf.jpg Loot Respawning / Persistence Enabling Persistence itself has been functioning for some time, the cause behind it being manually disabled on 0.57 stable servers is tied to an issue with loot respawning. We're aiming to have this issue resolved before we push 0.58 to stable branch, once we've tested this on experimental and are confident in the fix - players will be able to resume making camps, storing gear, and so on. Similar issues with dynamic event cleanup and respawn were the cause of static dynamic events - and these issues are currently being investigated, and are marked critical for the 0.58 launch. In addition to these issues, bugs related to severe player position desyncronization are currently being investigated, and flagged as a must fix for 0.59. I hope this brief list of information pertaining to 0.58 helps update those who may have not kept a close eye on the experimental branch updates. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Read the full Status Report on the DayZ Devhub",

We'll start off discussing the work ongoing with the new renderer for Enfusion, and then wrap up discussing the current behaviour and mechanics behind sprinting, holding breath, and so on. http://i.imgur.com/m9sNC5w.jpg Players who have been actively following the development of DayZ are aware of the large task the engine team undertook to separate the legacy RV renderer from the simulation, and replace it with a more modular and updated version. The task itself of creating a new renderer is not huge, the length and weight of the task is related primarily to: Separating the legacy renderer from the simulation Ensuring the separation is complete, as the RV engine and its functions tied to it are extensive Once the above was complete, the new renderer itself was broken into three primary modules. (Bear with us, this can be moderately technical) Pipeline module (1) the pipeline of objects rendering is new (defines the \"way\" how the objects are moving from entity in world to set of rendering commands) is responsible to prepare meshes to be rendered is multi-threaded filling of pipeline will be also multi-threaded, in phase of testing and debugging Material system module (2) objects are rendered using new material system, old one is still present to have the comparison each mesh has assigned a material (not rvmat) with material class which is responsible for it's rendering setting of material is editable in workbench editor and you see real-time the changes in render each material class was written from scratch, visualisation currently as much similar as possible to old render but now we can add simply new features (like PBR) huge simplification for filling GPU command buffers, can be easily sorted to minimize changes in command buffers all renderable game objects have now representation in material class High level rendering API module (3) GPU API is DX11 for now (With DX 12 supporting coming later) implementation of GPU API now hidden behind rendering API, no one is allowed to use direct GPU API commands it allows us to add new GPU API like DX12, XBOX one, PS4...much easier Initial implementation done, currently in testing and bug fixing phase (optimization still in progress but looks promising) http://i.imgur.com/hXuEf4l.jpg In addition: GUI manager GUI pipeline and rendering system is completely new and different from the one in original RV engine GUI layouts will be defined in workbench using graphic editor not by config system (huge improvement for designers) rendering works, currently debugging and working on the editor In a future experimental build it'll be possible to try it using command line switch (startup switch) other notes postprocesses were completely rewritten into new system of effects more worlds can be renderered in one frame, it allows to create independent scenes needed for workbench usable also in game to create e.g. mirrors, cameras... As work on the new renderer continues and we look at our plans for the eventual push to experimental we have several goals: - Testing partnerships with Intel, AMD, and nVidia to ensure compatability with market leader and average hardware configurations - Marked performance for gameplay in large cities (Elektro, Cherno, Novod, Severograd, Berezino, etc) Next up - There has been a good deal of discussion, and questions on exactly how hold breath, lung capacity, and dispersion when characters are tired. Below we have a few example videos with debug data on screen so you can see the specific values. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxSjqXGpF6M In the first video you see the user start out stationary - not tired, and begin to hold his breath. With the inaccuracy value falling sharply upon holding his breath, as the character continues to hold his breath and his lung capacity drains - the inaccuracy slowly starts climbing. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbURyZ0s9XA With the second video, we have a character who starts off tired (has been sprinting for an extended duration - 90 to 120 seconds of solid sprinting) who takes a knee (supported firing position) as his tired value decreases, his lung capacity increases - and he begins to hold his breath. Mind you, this is only how it performs now (on 0.57 stable) and this is prior to the implementation of weight and character stamina. That said, we would love to hear your thoughts on the current behavior of the mechanic. Please make sure to head over to the Official DayZ forums and discuss this in the latest Status Report discussion thread! Finally - the gameplay programming team has made headway on the annoying issue of sounds playing globally (splitting ammo, bandages, etc) and 0.58 should see the issue resolved!

Mind you, this is only how it performs now (on 0.57 stable) and this is prior to the implementation of weight and character stamina. That said, we would love to hear your thoughts on the current behavior of the mechanic. Please make sure to head over to the Official DayZ forums and discuss this in the latest Status Report discussion thread! Finally - the gameplay programming team has made headway on the annoying issue of sounds playing globally (splitting ammo, bandages, etc) and 0.58 should see the issue resolved! If you happen to still manage to repro, please open a ticket at feedback.dayzgame.com! - Brian Hicks/ Lead Producer For the full Status Report, please have a look at our DayZ Devhub",

Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks E3 - DayZ PC Gaming Show 2015 Dev Update/Chris Dev Update/Viktor Community Video: \"Long Story Short - I Got a Vybor Spawn\" Development Board Spotlight http://i.imgur.com/D8K8gh0.jpg http://i.imgur.com/h5Ay9va.jpg Dev Update/Hicks Greetings Survivors, Its been a hectic few weeks, with 0.57 release and E3 - but I'd like to take some time out this week to discuss pending changes to the Audio side of the Enfusion engine, as well as some critical audio bugs plaguing DayZ Early Access players. We've talked about replacing the existing Audio system in DayZ with a new Audio module better suited to DayZ's needs, but we haven't really outlined what some of that means. As many players may know, the inherited audio technology from the Real Virtuality (TKOH / Arma 2) side of the family has its strengths, but it also has quite a few weaknesses. As we began looking at the time and resources required to update this portion of our base engine, we looked at several key areas we wanted to improve: - 3D Positional Ambient Sound: Supporting true 3D Positional Ambient sounds is integral to proper immersion within Chernarus. As well, once we support this - the roar of the coast, and the confusing positional ambient noises should be a thing of the past. - More complex configuration options for vehicles, weapons, etc: Current technology supports a very basic methodology for potential sounds and triggering events for weapons, vehicles and the likes. Moving to the new Audio module will begin to allow the design and audio teams to implement more complex audio configurations for items and vehicles in game. As development on this portion of the engine continues, we'll be looking at other features existing internal projects offer (such as Arma 3's tech) to ensure that the support the Enfusion engine offers is as comprehensive as we can allow. In addition to this, work has continued internally on slaying the ever illusive audio bug beast known as \"Ghost sounds\" - Potential headway was revealed during a conference between key members of the Arma, and DayZ teams. Potential related causes of the issue, as well as fixes implemented on the Arma side of the company are hopefully going to be implemented. We'll be testing this out on experimental hopefully with 0.59 - I'll be speaking with people about this on the official DayZ forums when we begin testing, and anyone encountering the issue at that point is strongly encouraged to utilize the Feedback Tracker. See you all in Chernarus! - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer E3 - DayZ PC Gaming Show 2015 Also, we have a little bit of info in regards to modding and the singleplayer part of DayZ in the following video featuring Brian Hicks at this year's E3 convention.

Speaking of mods, Hicks said DayZ will be fully embracing the Steam Workshop. Finally, Hicks told us that Bohemia will be releasing the tools needed for players to host their own servers, a feature DayZ players have been asking for almost since the game appeared.

Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Community Spotlight: Barely Infected Development Board Spotlight http://i.imgur.com/q8hfGzb.gif http://i.imgur.com/jGufHp6.gif http://i.imgur.com/7sPUM6r.jpg Dev Update - Hicks With 0.57 on the horizon, this week I'd like to take time to talk a bit about player progression across Chernarus, the Central Loot Economy (and its impact on this), and the challenges DayZ faces compared to the Arma 2 Mod experience. First lets go over exactly what the Central Loot Economy is, and what it offers DayZ. - Migration of control over what items spawn from legacy method (script) into a more easily and rapidly updated system - This means the dev team can rapidly (and without requiring an update to the game) completely change / update the amount of items that spawn - This is done on both a global, and a per server level - in the future allowing custom server operators fine control over their server and its item spawn quantities without requiring any base modification to the game - Control over item lifetimes (speed of decay / time to item cleanup) - Control over how many of each item time is supposed to be present in the world (Min / Max / Nominal) - Control over item cost (rarity vs spawning methods) Why is the Central Loot Economy critical to DayZ's design - versus the original prototype placeholder loot spawning script? Simply put - the original method was a very rough prototype, designed to start populating the initial memory points for each structure. In order for the design and environment teams to be fully free to create a comprehensive, living breathing world - we first needed to begin to have fine and robust control that can be rapidly pushed to all servers. The original prototype method was very time resource heavy for updating, limited our options to traditional DayZ Mod style building definitions only, and in short pidgeon-holed the team into very limited control. http://i.imgur.com/3SlfZyt.jpg One of the images that has been circulating the DayZ Community over the last week is a map covering player progression across Arma 2's original Chernarus map. The layout of the original Chernarus, as well as the very limited amount of enterable structures, and thus very limited amount of potential spawn points for items meant an inherent flow of player movement across the map. It required very little work on the design side - High end military loot spawned mostly entirely at Barracks structures, Basic Supplies / Weapons at Firestations, Grocery Stores, Barns, and so on, and Medical supplies at Hospitals. The structure of *how* items spawned within the original Chernarus just -fit- the limited scope of that map perfectly. Moving into DayZ as a standalone project, one of the first tasks undertaken was the decentralization of core resource (points of interest) buildings - and the expansion of Chernarus into a more robust and living world. Nearly every structure was made enter-able, and thus nearly every single building on the map was a potential (or group of potential) points for items to spawn. At first this might not seem like it should have a major impact on the design, and flow of player progression across the map - but when you look at the statistics, it is rather telling. - In DayZ Mod, with vanilla Chernarus - Potential item spawn points number in the thousands (Sub 10k) - In DayZ Chernarus + the potential locations for items to spawn exceeds 1 Million.

Contents This Week Development Board Spotlight Dev Update/Hicks Dev Update/Peter Community Video: The battle of the V3S's Development Board Spotlight http://i.imgur.com/0MubfEr.png.jpg Dev Update - Hicks I'm frequently asked about player spawns, vehicle spawns, and the mentality behind where and why they are placed. I thought I would take the opportunity this week to discuss exactly that. http://i.imgur.com/FhnnzUZ.jpg For those aware of how DayZ Mod's gameplay flow operated - it was fairly simple. Players started along the coast - from Kamenka to as far as Berezino. Players progressed (for the most part) from the South - to the North. (For the most part, the North West) This gameplay required very little design side control to influence it. Natively the original Chernarus had very few buildings, and thus very few potential item spawn points (compared to say - Chernarus +). One of the initial goals of DayZ was to decentralize the flow of high value or required resources. Think medical centers, military installations, and so on. When approaching player spawns - early on my approach was to try and replicate the familiarity of player spawns in the earlier versions of DayZ Mod. (DayZ Mod circa Summer 2012 was used as a touch stone) We quickly learned that this approach did not work with the massively altered layout of Chernarus. Not to mention some of the changes to key coastal areas. The next experiment we ran with player spawns was to flip the map of Chernarus, and look at the player progression as East > West. From a design perspective this approach seemed the most logical in how we wanted to layout the world, and seemed on paper like it should find strong success. Never let it be said that nostalgia and familiarity has no merit. Players were very vocal in their longing for the familiar DayZ spawn points, Chernogorsk and Elektrozavodsk especially. Internally we were very reluctant to change this up as the early loot spawning system did not allow us any region control, and the design of Chernarus was heavily leaning towards letting us use any building model we wanted, where it made sense. (Think Military Police buildings in Chernogorsk, Balota Barracks, etc) However, as early prototyping on a more robust control over where region-wise certain items spawned, the idea of spawning in some of those core DayZ Mod areas was revisited. Obviously some small changes would need to occur to the layout of the world, as the system would take a good deal of time to develop - so Balota and the Northeast Airfield both got a redesign - and spawns from Kamyshovo to West Chernogorsk were reintroduced. http://i.imgur.com/8jwQF80.jpg As Dynamic Events, and Vehicles entered the equation their spawn placements were heavily influenced by where the existing player spawns lay, and how we wanted the flow of players across the map to operate. Obviously Dynamic Event types used to prototype the system were also used as a control point for \"Very Rare\" items - with the desired intent to ensure that in the final product, players could not farm one location across many servers to quickly gain an item the design team intended to be incredibly hard to find. (See: SVD) http://i.imgur.com/NLJRZiK.jpg Vehicles themselves followed a similar principle, as the prototype vehicle was a heavy vehicle designed to carry large amounts of both gear and players - the spawn positions for this were placed at the highest concentration in West / Northwest. As smaller, more civilian vehicles begin to be implemented we'll see more spawn types for them a bit closer to where player spawns are located. I hope this brief look into the thought process behind these areas helps you to understand how they evolve a bit better.

        "contents": "Greetings Survivors, We're rapidly approaching the experimental push of 0.56, and we've discussed over the last few weeks some of the things you can expect from this update to the Steam branch. I&#39;d like to recap a few key points though, as we're close to this push: http://i.imgur.com/VXX6HJ0.jpg - Rebalancing of Infected damage threshold - Redistribution of existing infected spawns to high population areas - Bugfixing on Per-Item-Quantity control (Central Economy) - Bugfixing on Infected Alert SFX - Bugfixing on Infected movement - Redesigned Inventory tech (engine side) - New firearms / long range optics attachment - Stary Sobor evacuation camp - Bugfixes on various known duplication vulnerabilities Tied with the 0.56 update to Stable branch, we'll see a hive wide reset (public/private) - including local storage data (player camps, vehicles) http://i.imgur.com/OivxCIK.jpg Development is ongoing with the hive side economy control, in addition to future bug fixing development continues on the functional side, with the next major goal being region control over item spawn types. (removing the restriction of structure types only in certain areas of the map). Internally, the programming and design teams are working hard on analyzing server side performance, player position desync, and other critical issues affecting Early Access gameplay. In some cases, resolutions to these issues are tied to the implementation of new technology to replace the legacy systems inherited from the start of the project - all of them however will be ongoing goals for the team over the coming months. The bulk of the workload over the last month was centered around the refactorization of the inventory system. It became clear that the existing tech behind the inventory wasn't going to be able to meet the needs of the project, and carried with it its own vulnerabilities. The redesign stripped large amounts of the system, and redesigned specifically to meet the needs of DayZ and upcoming changes to DayZ's core technology. - Support for AI and Vehicle Inventory - Removing limitation on \"in hands\" as a virtual slot (still occupying space in container) - Dynamic changing of cargo capacity - eg: lowering when damaged, raising when repaired - Manual item rotation - Support for redesign of Inventory UI - Support for EnScript (Enfusion Scripting Language) - And much, much more.. Looking at the Central Economy side of the fence, tracking the metrics on loot spawning provides some interesting details: - Chernarus + features 8,725 buildings (and wrecks combined) - 1,742,796 potential item spawn points are spread across the entirety of Chernarus + (Not counting dynamic events) - Of the 8,725 buildings/wrecks across Chernarus + 410 of them are greenhouses With the 0.56 iteration of the central economy we gain finer control over item spawn locations, but we still have a ways to go. As each update gets pushed to steam, we'll see finer and finer control over item spawn locations and types, as well as supporting dynamic random spawns - that will ensure unique spawns of valued items across the map. Who knows, maybe someday you'll get really lucky and find an M4A1 in that barn over the hill? As you all dive into the experimental push of 0.56 (not yet live) please keep in mind that like many things in the development of DayZ, the new systems and tech are works in progress (much like DayZ itself) and are incomplete, and more than likely contain their fair share of issues. Please make sure to report any issues found on the official feedback tracker at feedback.dayzgame.com See you out there, - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer ",

I&#39;d like to recap a few key points though, as we're close to this push: http://i.imgur.com/VXX6HJ0.jpg - Rebalancing of Infected damage threshold - Redistribution of existing infected spawns to high population areas - Bugfixing on Per-Item-Quantity control (Central Economy) - Bugfixing on Infected Alert SFX - Bugfixing on Infected movement - Redesigned Inventory tech (engine side) - New firearms / long range optics attachment - Stary Sobor evacuation camp - Bugfixes on various known duplication vulnerabilities Tied with the 0.56 update to Stable branch, we'll see a hive wide reset (public/private) - including local storage data (player camps, vehicles) http://i.imgur.com/OivxCIK.jpg Development is ongoing with the hive side economy control, in addition to future bug fixing development continues on the functional side, with the next major goal being region control over item spawn types. (removing the restriction of structure types only in certain areas of the map). Internally, the programming and design teams are working hard on analyzing server side performance, player position desync, and other critical issues affecting Early Access gameplay. In some cases, resolutions to these issues are tied to the implementation of new technology to replace the legacy systems inherited from the start of the project - all of them however will be ongoing goals for the team over the coming months. The bulk of the workload over the last month was centered around the refactorization of the inventory system. It became clear that the existing tech behind the inventory wasn't going to be able to meet the needs of the project, and carried with it its own vulnerabilities. The redesign stripped large amounts of the system, and redesigned specifically to meet the needs of DayZ and upcoming changes to DayZ's core technology. - Support for AI and Vehicle Inventory - Removing limitation on \"in hands\" as a virtual slot (still occupying space in container) - Dynamic changing of cargo capacity - eg: lowering when damaged, raising when repaired - Manual item rotation - Support for redesign of Inventory UI - Support for EnScript (Enfusion Scripting Language) - And much, much more.. Looking at the Central Economy side of the fence, tracking the metrics on loot spawning provides some interesting details: - Chernarus + features 8,725 buildings (and wrecks combined) - 1,742,796 potential item spawn points are spread across the entirety of Chernarus + (Not counting dynamic events) - Of the 8,725 buildings/wrecks across Chernarus + 410 of them are greenhouses With the 0.56 iteration of the central economy we gain finer control over item spawn locations, but we still have a ways to go. As each update gets pushed to steam, we'll see finer and finer control over item spawn locations and types, as well as supporting dynamic random spawns - that will ensure unique spawns of valued items across the map. Who knows, maybe someday you'll get really lucky and find an M4A1 in that barn over the hill? As you all dive into the experimental push of 0.56 (not yet live) please keep in mind that like many things in the development of DayZ, the new systems and tech are works in progress (much like DayZ itself) and are incomplete, and more than likely contain their fair share of issues. Please make sure to report any issues found on the official feedback tracker at feedback.dayzgame.com See you out there, - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer ",

Going forwards, we hope that you guys will keep helping us out with testing DayZ as development progresses. As mentioned, players that submit bugs from DayZ will get the chance of appearing in the Special Thanks section of the credits once DayZ goes into full release.

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/J7f8abp.jpg Greetings Survivors, As expected, work continues on 0.56 stable branch release. This release as mentioned prior will hit in the early weeks of May rather than the standard end-of-the-month update for April. This is mostly due to bugfixing that needs to occur related to the inventory refactorization in order to get the build to a state that can be used by the Early Access audience.  As well, the gameplay programming team are resolving the bugs discovered in the loot spawning system several weeks after the 0.55 stable date. Given that most of the core work these last few weeks has been on such major systems as the inventory, and central loot economy - I thought I would take the opportunity to discuss a few points people have requested hearing information about. First off, I feel the need to reiterate on Early Access, development builds, and what to expect. A few status reports ago I mentioned the fact that as we move forward through the development of DayZ, people *will* see more things break, more bugs, and so on. Part of getting access to DayZ as early as weve allowed via the Early Access program means that youre seeing the real ups and downs of game development. Ive seen people over the last few months on forums, twitter, and so on mention the back and forth stability of builds as if this is an anomaly - an oddity in software or game development. http://i.imgur.com/JmCFvlF.jpg Photo Credit: DayZIntel Early Access is as the fictional character James Kirk once referred to the USS Excelsior - \"The Great Experiment\". DayZ approached this at its truest form, 3 months into our principle development - and as said development has continued, the scope has expanded to include the development of the next game engine from Bohemia Interactive, Enfusion. It should go without saying, that the development of any large scope video game takes years. A multiplayer only title, that also aims to fully support Steam Workshop modding is no short order. Developing said title, the game engine powering it, and maintaining a steady monthly cadence of updates to the consumer is no short order. So I ask you, the Early Access user - when you encounter a bug that frustrates you - make sure it is listed in the feedback tracker, make sure you read the Status Reports (although, it seems that if you are reading this youve already completed this step), engage with the development team on the DayZ forums. Ive found that when it comes to the Early Access program and your experience with it, we'll all get out of it - what we put into it. Moving past that, many people have asked about the audio side of the Enfusion engine. Obviously fairly early on into the Early Access program, we realized that the existing audio technology interited from the RV engine wasn't going to suit the needs of the project. Problematic (and annoying) audio bugs began to reveal themselves, and resolving those within the legacy technology clearly demonstrated it would be time lost. Thus, work began on a new audio module to be paired with the in-development Enfusion engine. As with any core engine work, this is not a short form task. Obviously the goal for initial deployment is feature parity with the legacy audio technology, it is my personal hope that once this is achieved - we can look to expand the options for enhancing the audio experience in Chernarus, as I firmly believe audio in DayZ is just as critical as any core technology and part of the immersion into the world. http://i.imgur.com/dHHhrUZl.jpg My personal holy grail throughout the development of DayZ has, and will remain the server side performance. Much of what folks attribute to \"lag\" or \"desync\" can be traced back to poor server side performance. 85% of which comes from the performance heavy usage of SQF engine script for many gameplay systems. Mentioned in prior status reports, EnScript (the name for Enfusion's engine scripting language) is leaps and bounds ahead of the legacy SQF in terms of performance. This, the portion of the performance budget currently consumed by SQF usage is the largest roadblock between 50 player servers, and 100+ player servers. Moving the title completely away from legacy engine scripting tech, and onto the new engine scripting language for Enfusion is by no means a small task, and will be an ongoing goal for the team (and in my opinion 100% required for DayZ to reach 1.0) http://i.imgur.com/kZbq4oll.png Sample EnScript - Not actual in-game Last on my list for this week is some comments I wanted to make in regards to play styles, difficulty, and exactly how to play DayZ. Obviously, as DayZ is an open world sandbox title, nearly anything is technically possible (in regards to play styles). As the initial deployment of the new infected A.I., as well as the central economy ramped up the difficulty within Chernarus, there were people vocalizing how they disliked how difficult DayZ was becoming. Now, obviously I've spoken on this before - but I feel the need to reiterate, and clarify a few things. Surviving in Chernarus is intended to be difficult. I want you to value each bullet, I want discovering a roaming boar in the forest to be a stroke of good luck. However, this does not mean the play styles of \"Coastal Chaos\" or \"Squad play\" and so on are not viable playstyles. http://i.imgur.com/kWJxYMZ.jpg You can, and should be able to play DayZ however you want. Be warned however, every choice - every play style should, and will have its own cost. You can choose to spend your time in Elektro, fighting over sniper hill, or pitting your squad against a rival group up at the Northwest Airfield each have their own requirements to maintain, and overall costs (be it in time, health, resources, or life duration). Lastly, as the text below calls out - Standup notes are not a change log, they are a list of the things the teams have been working on this week, to give you all transparency into the current task priorities. So try not to get upset if you see a task thats being worked on not be in the latest stable branch update, and so on.

Ive found that when it comes to the Early Access program and your experience with it, we'll all get out of it - what we put into it. Moving past that, many people have asked about the audio side of the Enfusion engine. Obviously fairly early on into the Early Access program, we realized that the existing audio technology interited from the RV engine wasn't going to suit the needs of the project. Problematic (and annoying) audio bugs began to reveal themselves, and resolving those within the legacy technology clearly demonstrated it would be time lost. Thus, work began on a new audio module to be paired with the in-development Enfusion engine. As with any core engine work, this is not a short form task. Obviously the goal for initial deployment is feature parity with the legacy audio technology, it is my personal hope that once this is achieved - we can look to expand the options for enhancing the audio experience in Chernarus, as I firmly believe audio in DayZ is just as critical as any core technology and part of the immersion into the world. http://i.imgur.com/dHHhrUZl.jpg My personal holy grail throughout the development of DayZ has, and will remain the server side performance. Much of what folks attribute to \"lag\" or \"desync\" can be traced back to poor server side performance. 85% of which comes from the performance heavy usage of SQF engine script for many gameplay systems. Mentioned in prior status reports, EnScript (the name for Enfusion's engine scripting language) is leaps and bounds ahead of the legacy SQF in terms of performance. This, the portion of the performance budget currently consumed by SQF usage is the largest roadblock between 50 player servers, and 100+ player servers. Moving the title completely away from legacy engine scripting tech, and onto the new engine scripting language for Enfusion is by no means a small task, and will be an ongoing goal for the team (and in my opinion 100% required for DayZ to reach 1.0) http://i.imgur.com/kZbq4oll.png Sample EnScript - Not actual in-game Last on my list for this week is some comments I wanted to make in regards to play styles, difficulty, and exactly how to play DayZ. Obviously, as DayZ is an open world sandbox title, nearly anything is technically possible (in regards to play styles). As the initial deployment of the new infected A.I., as well as the central economy ramped up the difficulty within Chernarus, there were people vocalizing how they disliked how difficult DayZ was becoming. Now, obviously I've spoken on this before - but I feel the need to reiterate, and clarify a few things. Surviving in Chernarus is intended to be difficult. I want you to value each bullet, I want discovering a roaming boar in the forest to be a stroke of good luck. However, this does not mean the play styles of \"Coastal Chaos\" or \"Squad play\" and so on are not viable playstyles. http://i.imgur.com/kWJxYMZ.jpg You can, and should be able to play DayZ however you want. Be warned however, every choice - every play style should, and will have its own cost. You can choose to spend your time in Elektro, fighting over sniper hill, or pitting your squad against a rival group up at the Northwest Airfield each have their own requirements to maintain, and overall costs (be it in time, health, resources, or life duration). Lastly, as the text below calls out - Standup notes are not a change log, they are a list of the things the teams have been working on this week, to give you all transparency into the current task priorities. So try not to get upset if you see a task thats being worked on not be in the latest stable branch update, and so on. See you guys up north, - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Header image credit: Spalte  Status Report continued at: dayz.com/blog/status-report-22-apr-15",

        "contents": "Greetings Survivors, Build 0.55 has been on the Steam/Stable branch for a few weeks now, and with the new systems in place with this build we were able to gather some incredibly valuable bug data from all you eager beaver Early Access participants. That said, and before we get into details on this week and the plan moving forward a few words need to be mentioned. http://i.imgur.com/BBnkPIP.jpg Much like the warnings placed on the DayZ Store Page, and the DayZ Launch Screen, as well as the stickies on the DayZ Steam Forums - The Early Access program provides you with development builds of the project, not access to a feature, or functionally complete game. As this year progresses, more and more parts of the Enfusion engine and its accompanying technology will be merged into the main branch. This means things will break, sometimes things will break -hard-. We utilize the experimental branch to flesh out any catastrophically game breaking issues (think client crashes, server freezes, high repro progression loss, and so on) and at the end of the month the most stable development build gets pushed to Steam for all of you to poke, experiment, and have fun with. Testing is done in three tiers, each tier scaling up in load and volume. Internal, Experimental, Main (Stable) - and make no mistake. All three branches are for testing. So as we move forward to 0.56 and beyond, keep that detail in mind. Systems will break, bugs and interruptions of gameplay will occur - and as I will detail below, nothing finds the cracks in the stonework like throwing a rotation of roughly a million active players at a build and seeing how it holds up. http://i.imgur.com/ZP4Xkt6.jpg Through extensive monitoring of both private shard and public hive servers on 0.55 the team were able to identify two key bugs in the new loot and economy systems that did not appear in proper detail on experimental branch. These two separate issues affected the core persistence mechanic of DayZ in different, but similar ways. On one hand, we discovered aberrant behavior in item respawn positions, and the other (over this last weekend) we discovered loot respawning causing corruption in the primary persistence binarization (which caused some servers to believe it was \"okay\" to be operating at 20,000 items less than the defined red-line). These two bugs are the primary focus of the members of the gameplay programming team responsible for the loot economy, and player progression - and will be included in the 0.56 update (scheduled for early in May). In an effort to mitigate the issue in the mean time, during the Wednesday maintenance period this week we will be switching servers over to the legacy placeholder loot spawning system. Unfortunately this means some of the newer items won't spawn, but it will keep the economies going until 0.56 hits stable branch. Paired with this hotfix, we will be instructing GSPs to reset the persistence structure for each stable branch server. So pack up those tents post haste. Moving forward we'll be segregating the base building type objects from the main persistence structure, so in the case of any issues like this popping up again during development - player camps will not be effected. http://i.imgur.com/IepgnyJ.jpg On a more fun note, The Survivor GameZ are holding the Survivor GameZ VI this upcoming Sunday - Frequently coined the \"Super Bowl of DayZ\" we'll be seeing some very well known personalities from across the Twitch and DayZ content creation sphere going head to head in a 2 man team based fight to the death.

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/mAzEONM.jpg Greetings Survivors, As most of you may know, last week saw 0.55 pushed to stable branch. This build featured the initial implementation of several key systems to DayZ, and in turn their behavior is as expected very early prototype. As the Early Access of DayZ continues, more of the core systems that comprise it will be merged into the main stable branch. It goes without saying that iteration will both be required, and occur as these are merged in. For 0.55 lets take a look at what systems had their initial implementation, and how their behavior is as of this status report: Central Economy: The Central Economy functions as the core control over item type quantity, location, and region spawns. Moving away from the original placeholder system, and implementing this is the first step towards agile, rapid balancing of item spawns within DayZ. The initial implementation only defines the location of firearm spawns and types, further iteration will begin to define items past firearms - and later region control across the map. Infected & Animal A.I.: A well known fact for awhile now, the original prototype A.I. that was deployed with the DayZ Early Access was not robust enough to support the design of the title. A complete rewrite from scratch on how the title handled this was required. The most obvious change on stable branch is in the detection, and quantity of the infected. The new system, although clearly in need of iteration and expansion - supports proper stealth mechanics for both A.I., as well as more resource friendly sensors. The design and programming teams will continue to iterate, and balance the infected across the coming months as well as address core functionality issues such as positioning during pathfinding, and proper audio alerts. Per-Instance-Persistence: Part and parcel with the core design of DayZ is the global persistence of items (loot) in the game space. Be it long-life persistent objects such as those used in base building, or more short term such as items dropped on the ground and spawned by the central economy. 0.55 saw this roll out to Public Hive servers, with Private Shard support soon to follow. It is important to understand that this feature, just like all of the Early Access has no guarantee of bug-free behavior. Like anything within the development builds, bugs are both possible, and almost certainly will occur. Equally as important is that those who encounter issues file proper bug reports on the Feedback Tracker (feedback.dayzgame.com) Diseases & Disease Transfer: Another very early implementation that made it to stable branch with 0.55 was the global spread of cholera across Chernarus. Paired with the transfer between players and objects, and thus player to player disease transfer. As iteration upon this system continues you will begin to see a more diverse catalogue of diseases and corresponding symptoms. Moving past the 0.55 build new system implementations we hit a rather hot button topic as of late, and one I promised to speak on earlier this week. Just how hard is DayZ supposed to be? What is the targeted experience here? How valuable should items, and thus what I carry be to me as a player? I like to think we're pretty up front about exactly what DayZ is and is supposed to be, and as we move closer to 1.0 more and more of this will begin to take shape. Once, when asked how valuable tools and resources should be to a player - on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is finding everything you need without issue, and 10 is elation over finding a can of beans (I'm paraphrasing here) Dean was quoted saying an emphatic \"10\". Some folks have expressed concern that the increasing difficulty in surviving and combating the environment would hurt player interaction. To which I say.. Sure, it will hurt player interaction if by player interaction you mean folks wandering up and down the coast, wearing pink dresses and chasing each other with fire extinguishers. However I firmly believe it will -drive- and foster a different type of player interaction. http://i.imgur.com/Qdi2BKd.jpg Interaction between players making their way across Chernarus, scavenging to survive. Players who enter a village and have to make a hard decision - do I use what little ammunition I have to kill and steal from the survivors already in this town? Do I instead avoid the risk of death from attacking another player, only to potentially risk death by starvation or infected as I make my way around the town? Is the cost of expending my resources in either choice too great? Make no mistake, DayZ is and always has been intended to be an unforgiving, brutal fight for survival in a harsh post apocalyptic landscape. Obviously we still have a long ways to go to get to that point, but as we move forward more and more systems will be introduced that support that experience. Balancing and adjustment will have to occur, as the intended experience is not to ensure starvation on the coast, but instead foster the ability to spawn, gather the basic supplies required to move inland, and thus begin the real DayZ experience - your story, your struggle for survival. http://i.imgur.com/mq11DZv.jpg And the beauty of it all? If this is not the experience you're exactly looking to have with DayZ - then another core pillar of DayZ's design will bring you exactly what you seek. Our full support for modding via the Steam Workshop. It is going to be an exciting year survivors, and I look forward to experiencing it with all of you. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer  ",

This week we have yet another streamer that a lot of you guys will most likely have come across. His works include some awesome roleplay in which he time and again manages to grab hold of unsuspecting players and throw them down the deep, black pit that DayZ turns into, after he has molded the server world into his own helter skelter playground. Our DayZ content creator for this week is: http://dayz.com/files/images/MrMoon.jpg As mentioned, rp seems to be an overall element of Mr. Moon&#39;s videos/streams and depending on the roles he chooses to play, his creations sometimes seem a bit more serious in terms of acting and sometimes not so much. In the category of more, ehhh, “regular” goofing around (still with training in mind though), his video “Training Day” supplied me with plenty of laughs for a good half an hour or so! Also, at 12:56; well, old Bricktop said it best. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GHBWhGpMOY  While watching Mr. Moon's streams and videos over time, it has been rather interesting and impressive to witness his ability to interact with and influence other players, and his skill at adapting to the dynamics of an ever changing group of random players is mighty empressive! For a good example of his player whisperer skills, you should have a look at his video “Maverick”: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY8mOw7-RT8  In the more rp-heavy end of the scale, Mr. Moon's choice use of ingame elements/objects, character emotes, voice over, as well as camera work and great editing results in some of his creations taking on a more cinematic feel which makes for some quite enjoyable viewing. One example of such, is part 2 of his \"Welcome to the Family\" series. The intro sequence for this video is nothing short of excellent! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyAVmiYqKu8 Mr. Moon, if it wasn't for the constant fear of randomly falling victim to cannibalism, torture, or worse, I'm sure a lot of us would wish we could follow you around a server for a couple of hours and experience DayZ in a very different way.  As always, if interested in more, please feel free to follow Mr. Moon via the following social media accounts: http://twitter.com/mrmoon1000 http://www.youtube.com/user/MrMoonsHouse http://www.twitch.tv/mrmoonshouse http://www.facebook.com/MrMoonsHouse  - Michael aka SMoss / Community Manager",

Also, at 12:56; well, old Bricktop said it best. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GHBWhGpMOY  While watching Mr. Moon's streams and videos over time, it has been rather interesting and impressive to witness his ability to interact with and influence other players, and his skill at adapting to the dynamics of an ever changing group of random players is mighty empressive! For a good example of his player whisperer skills, you should have a look at his video “Maverick”: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY8mOw7-RT8  In the more rp-heavy end of the scale, Mr. Moon's choice use of ingame elements/objects, character emotes, voice over, as well as camera work and great editing results in some of his creations taking on a more cinematic feel which makes for some quite enjoyable viewing. One example of such, is part 2 of his \"Welcome to the Family\" series. The intro sequence for this video is nothing short of excellent! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyAVmiYqKu8 Mr. Moon, if it wasn't for the constant fear of randomly falling victim to cannibalism, torture, or worse, I'm sure a lot of us would wish we could follow you around a server for a couple of hours and experience DayZ in a very different way.  As always, if interested in more, please feel free to follow Mr. Moon via the following social media accounts: http://twitter.com/mrmoon1000 http://www.youtube.com/user/MrMoonsHouse http://www.twitch.tv/mrmoonshouse http://www.facebook.com/MrMoonsHouse  - Michael aka SMoss / Community Manager",

Since&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/best-minecraft-mods/\">Minecraft</a> made us more comfortable with the idea of&nbsp;selling incomplete games, we've seen dozens&nbsp;of PC games embrace paid alphas and betas as part of their development process&mdash;everything from MechWarrior Online to H1Z1 and Heroes of the Storm.

It seems like with other types of entertainment, there are several different categories of content. There are videos that explain the player's thought process behind actions, videos that showcase content / mechanics / features, and there are videos that feature entertainment in the form of roleplay for example. This week we'll have a look at the works created by: SepticFalcon! http://i.imgur.com/hWk0Fn7.jpg Among other things, such as videos showing pvp and other random goodness, SepticFalcon has created showcases of both Stable as well as Experimental updates for quite some time now. These videos serve as really nice informational sources for players that have just set foot on Chernarus soil, or players that return to DayZ after having missed previous updates for example. One such video is SepticFalcon's showcase of the current 0.54 Stable branch version wherein he highlights what has been introduced and/or reworked in this Stable branch update. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp7U04zmiOY  As mentioned, SepticFalcon does also do creations other than showcases of Stable/Experimental branch updates. A nice example is the video called “A Bad Negotiation”. This video is from SepticFalcon's great locker of videos that show his DayZ pvp skills – as well as a bit of bad luck for his adversaries at “6:05”, heh. Fending off foes while moving around and chambering rounds for each successive shot is no small feat (especially when you manage to still be standing at the end of the encounter).

        "contents": "Greetings Survivors! Lets start out this week by recapping what was shared via the Official Forums, and Dev Hub. Andrej our Sound Designer shared some work in progress versions of the new infected sounds over on the development board. The ones shared are obviously only the male infected sounds, but are give a good representation of the direction the sound department is headed with their side of the new infected work. Dev Hub - WIP Infected SFX As well, Andrej, Peter, and myself headed down south to Moravia to visit an open air shooting range with the Arma sound team. New sound effects for a wide array of weapons were recorded for both titles. Obviously a good deal of work will have to be done to prepare them for use within each title, but it is an important step towards driving the authenticity of the firearms within DayZ. http://i.imgur.com/U9cyaypm.jpg http://i.imgur.com/jSI43Bum.jpg Viktor, our Lead Animator shared a work in progress video of the new player controller, and some of the gestures/movements possible with it. Obviously it goes without saying that this is still very early, but as development on both DayZ and the core Enfusion engine progresses - more of this work gets merged into the stable branch. I for one cannot wait to see survivors interact with the new player controller. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ8Hv8wnmfQ Honza T, and Peter our Lead Designer have been over on the Official DayZ forums (and the Dev Hub) to discuss the potential evolution of the 3PP Camera - how it will effect gameplay, and gather feedback on the prototype work done so far.  As mentioned prior, this is all prototype work - and something we've wanted to address since long before the Early Access began. 3PP camera allowing you to see things that are outside your line of sight is a huge pain in the ass for us. I'm confident we'll be able to address this smoothly, without compromising the visual enjoyment many folks get out of 3PP camera perspective. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-gtNWvocd0 Looking forward towards the 0.55 Stable release work continues on the Central Economy, Group AI, and the new player controller. For 0.55 though we do have a nice list of content, as well as the initial implementation of the new infected AI. This should allow us to greatly increase the amount of infected spawning per server. (Roughly triple) Now, this won't get us to where we want to be at 1.0, but it is a strong step forward. Obviously a more robust system for where, and how the infected spawn - as well as plugging it into systems such as the dynamic events to allow us to spawn hordes is the end goal here. The ongoing work with the Central Economy will (when pushed to stable) allow us far more granular control over what spawns, in what type of area, and in what quantity. This is a huge step forward for us in terms of pushing DayZ closer to the punishing struggle for survival that is intended to be. As well, when fully functional it should allow the environment team a much broader canvas to where they place structures, and free the economy from defining a broad scope per building type. Lastly, work on the security side is always ongoing. Several new ban waves have gone out addressing some new issues - and on the engine side, the bigger scope tasks of addressing legacy vulnerabilities continues. In April we hope to announce a few new initiatives that will allow us to fully take advantage of the valuable in-development time that DayZ Early Access provides us in order to have a more secure title at 1.0. On a personal note, I recently encountered an amazing fan made intro for a DayZ content creator's twitch stream that is -amazingly- well done, and really drives home the style of play this content creator produces. I strongly encourage you to take three minutes of your time and check it out! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rRVO-1-1PA I hope to see you all in Chernarus, and don't worry - I have a mic. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer \"The animation team has recently finished some major tasks related to the new zombie implementation. Our next focus is improving these and adding some advanced behavior. We will look into improving hit reactions by adding directional hits. One of upcoming updates will also include crawling infected. Besides that we are working on the new player character, which is a huge task divided into many small parts. Currently, we have basic movement for unarmed, rifle, two handed and pistols working. That means we can walk and run around when holding this items. Unfortunately there is big load of work left. We are still missing attack animations, aiming, reloading, special moves, item usage and many other specific actions. On the other hand, we have already managed to bring some improvements in. The most notable one is synchronized animations when running and walking. That means when you switch from one move to another there is no glitch. New animation continues where previous left. Another important addition is using gestures while moving. Yes, finally you can wave and run around. On the same note is switching weapons. Player is able to take or hide gun while moving and any time you stop running the character will stop, but arming/disarming will continue. And last but not least, we have now falling and landing animations. It is a placeholder in current state, but the idea is to have different landing animations depending on the height of the fall.\" - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Standup Notes for the week of 24 Mar 15 (Note: Standup notes are not a change log - they are a quick high level look at tasks the teams worked on throughout this week) Animation: Support for new player character system UMP 45 Reloading Animations New Mocap List WIP SVD Reloading Animations BugfixingDesign: Central Economy Barrel Crafting Infected Diseases Triggers Plant Pests Fireplaces 3PP Camera Prototyping Vehicle TransmissionProgramming: Inventory refactorization Dynamic Events Vehicle Transmission bugfixing Infected/Animal AI New Player Character controller Advanced Loot Distro bugfixing Network and Memory Optimizations A.I.

Another important addition is using gestures while moving. Yes, finally you can wave and run around. On the same note is switching weapons. Player is able to take or hide gun while moving and any time you stop running the character will stop, but arming/disarming will continue. And last but not least, we have now falling and landing animations. It is a placeholder in current state, but the idea is to have different landing animations depending on the height of the fall.\" - Viktor Kostik / Lead Animator  Standup Notes for the week of 24 Mar 15 (Note: Standup notes are not a change log - they are a quick high level look at tasks the teams worked on throughout this week) Animation: Support for new player character system UMP 45 Reloading Animations New Mocap List WIP SVD Reloading Animations BugfixingDesign: Central Economy Barrel Crafting Infected Diseases Triggers Plant Pests Fireplaces 3PP Camera Prototyping Vehicle TransmissionProgramming: Inventory refactorization Dynamic Events Vehicle Transmission bugfixing Infected/Animal AI New Player Character controller Advanced Loot Distro bugfixing Network and Memory Optimizations A.I.

If you haven't had a look - head over and you'll see some awesome work in progress stuff - like the SVD Sniper Rifle, V3S Animations, and new zombie models. http://dayz.com/files/images/UMP45_render.jpg Peter, our Lead Designer will be discussing below in more detail zombies and diseases. This week I'd like to talk about a few in progress updates that I'm looking forward to. First off, we have the mentioned full randomization of weapon spawn configurations. This ranges from attachment configuration, quantity, type, and condition. When functional, each weapon you find should be as unique as possible per that item type. Be it the chance to spawn with a magazine, potential attachment, overall weapon condition, and so on. This expands upon the uniqueness of each persons kit in-game, and ensures that very few two firearms are exactly the same. Who knows, you might get lucky and find that M1911 Engraved you always wanted, -with- a clip! http://dayz.com/files/images/AKM.jpg  Moving on to more advanced weapon customization, we've done a good deal of discussion on allowing more specific customization per weapon. Adding in rail systems, shoe horn mount scopes, barrel swaps, and so on. Controlling when and where this is done is critical to the flow of gameplay across the map. Creating hot spots, and high traffic areas for players looking to gear up, and create their favorite weapon. At this point, we're looking at adding in advanced crafting tables into this existing (soon to be enter-able) maintenance structure scattered throughout Chernarus.  http://dayz.com/files/images/2015-03-16_00009.jpg Heading into April, we'll be discussing the tasks and accomplishments of Q1 2015, what the road ahead looks like and the status of long term engine tasks. From the new renderer, to the new player controller, server side performance, and so much more. Keep an eye on the Dev Hub, and the official DayZ forums for the latest news and information on DayZ Early Access. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer \"It is clear that former, by purpose simplified infected AI wasn't a hit by any means and it was frustrating to play and look at. When I was talking about the new infected in the Status Report two weeks ago I had a feeling that it would stir things up a bit. A few days after that I made short video with a horde running after a player and recently we released experimental update with the first implementation of infected AI. There were so many positive reactions on the direction that the new infected are heading, that the entire team was pleased. However there were also some which were calling for changing the DayZ lore and turning the infected into slowly moving beings.  I appreciate different opinions but I can't see any reason why we should make infected as stationary as possible, it will just simplify the game too much in such case. It is important to understand that the infected in DayZ are not the undead, and to be honest I don't want to see DayZ to become a frenzied run and grab all you can simulator. I would like to remind you that DayZ isn't supposed to be easy and straightforward, it&#39;s meant to be hard and unforgiving.  While they are pretty fast right now it is just the perception in comparison with current character movement speed, which is planned to be lowered in general as it was increased intentionally when we had decided to do a complete overhaul on how the engine handles vehicles, and thus they would be absent for some time. As well I'm looking forward to the implementation of a proper stamina system for characters which alone will cut off the constant sprinting across the map and thorough the structures which is just ridiculous. With the agile infected that are able to catch up with you while you are escaping the scene you will think twice about your approach and also the load you are carry as it especially determines how far you will be able to sprint to loose them. To balance things out, the infected have their own stamina and are slowing down during the chase and with the combination of the possibility that they can stumble upon it gives you a some chance to flee if you run into such situations. The infected AI will be continuously worked on, in terms of expanding it further and also balancing it close to the perfection. I would like to mention that we are bringing to life the long awaited disease system which in fact was hibernating under the hood for some time, but was never finished due the other needs. Diseases are described by their virulence parameters like transferability, invasivity and toxicity and to determine the potential influence on character, which can vary from carrier to heavy impact, they are compared against his or her current state counting in the levels of health, blood, diet and exposure. Diseases can be transferred in both directions, which means it's not wise to eat from the same meal after your companion, if you suspect that he may be ill. Physical and chemical resistance parameters of disease determines how it can be treated or their effects eased by medicinal drugs and after the disease passed you are resistant to catch it again for some time. System also have the possibility to be expanded with the use of gloves, niosh masks or other wearables which can obstruct transferring of the diseases by specific actions, like crafting. Stay healthy... see you in Chernarus folks!\" - Peter / Lead Designer  Standup Notes for the week of 17 Mar 15 (Note: Standup notes are not a change log - they are a quick high level look at tasks the teams worked on throughout this week) Animation: Support for new player character system Hand poses Zombie animation bugfixing SVD Reloading Animations V3S AnimationsDesign: Central Economy Barrel Crafting Infected Diseases Triggers Plant Pests Fireplaces Cooking Vehicle TransmissionProgramming: Inventory refactorization Dynamic Events Vehicle Transmission bugfixing Infected/Animal AI New Player Character controller Crash to Desktop Bugfixing Network and Memory Optimizations   ",

Partly that means multipurpose barrels&mdash;placeable containers that can be used for storage, as a rain-catching device, or as cover against incoming fire. But also, Hicks shows some of the work being done to zombies. \"Again - this is very early implementation,\" writes Hicks,&nbsp;\"however as work progresses into the next week the design team are working on sneaking and stealthy tactics when dealing with this new A.I. system. Moving into the next experimental branch window, we ll be looking at pushing the early implementation work out to this branch and testing with varied numbers across all servers.\" ",

        "contents": "Greetings Survivors, As we move towards the 0.54 stable branch update, I’d like to cover a few points that you all should know. As with all updates during Early Access, this is a development build and thus has its own issues, bugs, and so on. If you encounter any of this, please open a ticket over at feedback.dayzgame.com. More specifically, for those who may be experiencing issues seeing servers in the server browser – please make your way over to this thread on the Official DayZ forums for instructions from Community Manager SMoss, and BattlEye developer Bastian. Part of the 0.54 is the tech required to support the redesign of our user interface. This is just the initial work required to support said changes, not the changes itself. Thus everything will –look- different, but not necessarily how we intend it to look by the time we hit 1.0. The user interface is just one part of the evolving technology coming in from the engine and gameplay programming teams, and will be iterated throughout Early Access. http://dayz.com/files/images/New_UI1.jpg As well, with 0.54 comes the initial implementation of the new animal A.I., this system is still early on so odd behaviour will be encountered. However even with the system in this early state, this is a strong step in the direction of a more robust, lifelike animal behaviour system. I for one look forward to the hermit-hunter lifestyle the next time I log in on my public hive character. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs8yzoARTO4 In addition to a large amount of new content to explore, new enterable structures, villages, redesigned areas and more – 0.54 features continued security enhancements, bug fixes and more. Over the coming weeks SMoss will also be rolling out some new features over on the community side of DayZ.com, including a weekly Community Focus that showcases user created content, streams, art, and so much more. Head over to the Community hub at DayZ.com and take a look. As always, developers are on hand to take your suggestions and feedback on the Official DayZ forums at forums.dayzgame.com. Brian Hicks / Lead Producer As we are getting closer to the release of the next stable branch update of DayZ with version number 0.54, we are focusing more on tidying up and fixing the most annoying bugs and issues instead of working on new features or expanding existing ones. For example we identified and fixed a long timer related to synchronizing the temperature of objects, which was consuming relatively large chunk of communication between server and client. Fortunately it didnt happened often or in large scale but its really great to have it fixed now with upcoming refactored fireplace which will become more usable with more items thus used by survivors. There was also few issues which was fixed related to the independent liquid types we introduced in last version, one worthy to mention is the issue which completely breaks character stomach, energy and water statuses.   I already mentioned the fireplace which is undergoing a refactoring for some time now and its getting seamlessly to the fixing and polishing stage. Now when there is the solid foundation of the system the next step is the cooking process in general. With plenty of the different food available in the game and three distinctive food processing types, to name them - boiling, baking and drying, things can get out of control really quickly. Well at least especially when we want to stretch the possibilities and interactions to the maximum and want to visualize the outcome of the process. What will happen when food is already baked and you start to boiling it? Do you need to pre-process the food before drying? What about moldy food? And plenty of other questions related to that topic which needs to be answered beforehand. After the intended cooking mechanics are in place and the central economy is working as it should, we can finally say good bye to the generous amount of spawned non-perishable food.  Most of you are probably waiting for the enrichment of the vehicles controls - manual transmission. We had some quality time already while trying it on our internal build, but it needs a little bit more time to be tweaked into the state which is safe for public release. Good thing is that with its implementation some of the issues with vehicles behavior were properly addressed so little bit of waiting doesnt hurt. As far as vehicles parts goes I owe you at least quick update, their functionality is dependent mostly on the new inventory system that is currently being implemented and of course on the support from the extended vehicle simulation itself.  Last but not least we are making steady progress on the new AI for infected which is getting along nicely and I hope you will be able to experience it and its benefits soon on experimental versions before it hits the stable release later on, however animal AI will be released beforehand.  Start preparing your nerves for some intense encounters... see you in Chernarus folks! \" Peter / Lead Designer  Standup Notes for the week of 24 Jan 15 (Note: Standup notes are not a change log - they are a quick high level look at tasks the teams worked on throughout this week) Animation: Trumpet reloading animation Winchester reloading Zombie attack animations V3S Animations MoCap SessionDesign: Manual transmission Firearms Damage V3S Cargo Gas cooker refactoring Fireplace Polishing Diseases transfer New script language Central economy BugfixingProgramming: Inventory refactorization Loot distribution per buildings Zombie/Animal AI Character controller (animations & physics) Vehicles - Manual transmission and bugfixing Flaregun Improvements Security Bugfixes  ",

        "contents": "Greetings Survivors, As some of you may be aware, we've been experimenting a bit with the format and release day of the Status Reports coming into 2015. With upcoming changes to DayZ.com as a centralized point of information on the development of DayZ, the Status Reports will be released on Tuesdays from now on. Additionally, we'll be making an effort to make the Status Reports more visual, for those who do not have the time to read what is new in the world of DayZ development. Moving onto said development, you'll soon be seeing the spawning of a different variation on the V3S. This variant will allow for the transportation of larger groups of players. The spawn rate across the world will remain at fifteen vehicles for the time. Initially you will not be able to access the inventory of the vehicle, this will be supported shortly on stable branch. As well, finalized animations, and firing from passenger positions will be supported in later builds on stable branch. The initial intent of spawning vehicles supporting large groups of players is to gauge both the performance, and functionality of large player groups moving together at high speed across Chernarus. Any issues discovered should be reported to feedback.dayzgame.com whenever possible. http://i.imgur.com/KximhbX.jpg In addition, Chernarus should soon also begin to see the roll out of the new animal A.I. system that briefly made an appearance in 0.53 experimental branch. Animal behaviors should be significantly more complex, and add a great deal to the immersion and feel of hunting for your next meal, or resource. Initially this will roll out with the deer, and then progressively expand to support the full list of animals residing in the world of DayZ. http://i.imgur.com/uuNlfGQ.gif Lastly for me, we've been discussing the subject of blood regeneration, transfusion, and all the mechanics surrounding them for awhile. With blood regeneration at the rate it currently is, and the reduced amount of blood gained per blood bag, not many folks use or interact with these mechanics in the current stable build. Given that now is the time to experiment, and alter these mechanics to gauge viability through use on our steam branches we&#39;ll be reducing the blood regeneration rate, and increasing the amount of blood gained through proper blood transfusions. Personally I cannot wait to see how the survivors of Chernarus adapt to this change. http://i.imgur.com/IgzxXbp.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/XAWslNN.png  Mr. Black0ut picked up his Hardcore DayZ Series again, you should all take a look. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer  Mirek / Lead Gameplay Programmer \"I'd like to mention a few brief words about the new character/player controller. The physics part of this controller will be implemented using Bullet physics, so there will be a visible improvement in interactions between static and dynamic objects. e.g. there shouldn't any camera clipping issues, it will improve melee combat, movement on stairs, and it will be possible to get over dropped items and dead bodies. It will have also positive impact on performance. The animation side of this will be using Enfusion's new animation system and will allow us to have more animation layers on character, so it will be possible to play more animations at once. With this, we can achieve moving during shooting from the bow or adding injured animations. The character/player controller will be used for players and for AI units. We would like to introduce the physical part on character controller in 0.55 experimental. As for the animation part (which is already used for animals), there is a lot of work with exporting data to the new system and with complete rewriting of current system, but its in progress now and we hope, that we will introduce it in 0.56 (0.57 more likely) experimental build..\"  Read more..",

The physics part of this controller will be implemented using Bullet physics, so there will be a visible improvement in interactions between static and dynamic objects. e.g. there shouldn't any camera clipping issues, it will improve melee combat, movement on stairs, and it will be possible to get over dropped items and dead bodies. It will have also positive impact on performance. The animation side of this will be using Enfusion's new animation system and will allow us to have more animation layers on character, so it will be possible to play more animations at once. With this, we can achieve moving during shooting from the bow or adding injured animations. The character/player controller will be used for players and for AI units. We would like to introduce the physical part on character controller in 0.55 experimental. As for the animation part (which is already used for animals), there is a lot of work with exporting data to the new system and with complete rewriting of current system, but its in progress now and we hope, that we will introduce it in 0.56 (0.57 more likely) experimental build..\"  Read more..",

        "contents": "http://i.imgur.com/ikgecJ4.jpg Greetings Survivors! As most of you may know by now, 0.53 released to stable branch with build 126384. After daily iterative updates to experimental branch we were able to resolve the branch update preventing bugs, we moved forward with work on the next stable branch update 0.54. 0.53 has some outstanding new content, but for me personally the focus of this months stable update was taking a more aggressive stance on exploiting, and cheating within the development period of DayZ. As I've mentioned before, security in competitive multiplayer gaming is an ongoing battle for the industry. Add into this the fact that DayZ is still early in its development, with extensive changes to the engine ongoing, as well as existing vulnerabilities in legacy portions of the technology, and we have an uphill battle to deal with. The positive side of this coin however is very clear. Being vigilant in monitoring, investigating, and preventing exploits and vulnerabilities during DayZ's development period will make for a stronger game at release. As our work with BattlEye on 0.53 continues to evolve, there are several fronts we can utilize to increase our awareness and speed at which we can identify and address vulnerabilities with each stable branch update. If you discover any exploit or bug you believe to be unknown - file a bug on the DayZ feedback tracker. feedback.dayzgame.com Follow up to this with an email to security@dayz.com and include the link to your tracker issue in the body of your email. Previously mentioned, integrating our work with BattlEye on a closer level with the Valve Anti-Cheat system and team Providing an in-game option for players to report suspected cheaters Expanding upon the existing internal security team as we grow closer to 1.0 Enough about cheating though, lets talk about a few key points that everyone wants to know about as 2015 kicks off. Infected/Animal AI: Like many systems that involve large changes to the engine, the development of this system occurs in its own branch, outside the main trunk of DayZ development. This is not just because of limited functionality, development of core systems like this can frequently cause stability issues in the base game as they are worked on. Once their functionality is present at a base level, they are merged into the main game and pushed to stable branch in that months stable update. For those that were able to get a glimpse of this system early on in 0.53 experimental, you saw some outstanding changes to the way the A.I. for animals functioned. Beyond the animal side of the A.I. changes, infected A.I. redesign is aimed at introducing proper stealth gameplay and evasion in order to survive against the infected, and especially within urban environments. Renderer: As with the A.I. redesign, work on this is done outside the main trunk of DayZ development. A large part of the core engine teams' work, detaching the renderer from the engine side simulation is and has been a massive task that takes a significant amount of man hours. As we begin to see the fruits of the work done on this portion of the tech merged over into the stable branch of DayZ in the coming months, this will allow the engine team to start work on bringing newer Direct X support into DayZ. Audio: Some of the most irritating and pesky issues affecting gameplay within development builds can be traced to the audio side of our base engine. Redesigning the existing technology into a more robust solution is a must. Work on this, much like the above systems is ongoing, and when ready for the merge into stable branch will allow the team to begin addressing and resolving issues such as global sounds, and the proper messaging of all interaction and engine based sound sources. Beyond the above mentioned core technology changes, the coming months will have us begin to see changes that update or expand upon existing systems such as animation, loot spawning, persistence, and so much more. http://i.imgur.com/pmWAqhq.gifhttp://i.imgur.com/4K4Sb3X.gifhttp://i.imgur.com/2hF3470.gif In addition to these, once vehicle inventory support makes its way to stable branch we will begin to be able to see multiple configurations of the V3S, and their potential cargo spawning across Chernarus. Pair these changes with the ever changing face of Chernarus and the experience that is DayZ, and I see 2015 being an exciting year that I cannot wait to share with you all. http://i.imgur.com/1at56xY.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/NTZriED.jpg See you all in Chernarus, and be careful when visiting the prison. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer  ",

As mentioned prior in the September 15 Status Report - only so much can be done in tandem with engine and gameplay changes coming with every update (and maintain a rapid update frequency to stable branch). That said, as the primary vulnerability on the security side for DayZ right now is less on engine and/or scripting and more on modifying/accessing the process memory we have several Q1 goals we are aiming to complete. Deployment of a new form of BattlEye This has been delayed to allow testing/regression around any potential bugs and/or compatibility issues so as not to cause any major issues to those participating in Early Access Server side sanity checks and protection against certain currently exploited methods Closer work with Valve and the VAC team This will initially be seen by allowing players to report in-game suspected cheaters and will expand from there to a program that best fits DayZ and how it operates Expanded vigilance in reporting all known tools and methods currently used to access the DayZ process for less than honorable methods. Beyond that, Q1 has a good deal of exciting work for DayZ. Be it work on the new infected AI, to implementation of the central economy or diseases - this should be an exciting few months. On the note of work to come, I'd like to expand upon confusion around persistence - how it is intended to operate, and the role that weekly persistence wipes currently serve. Persistence is a core pillar of DayZ and its design. Currently persistence functionality is tied to the incomplete economy functions. As we expand upon the systems surrounding the central economy - What is saved/How it is saved, Cleanup, Respawn, etc will be handled properly. In addition to that, the secondary cause of persistence wipes (issues with reading modifiers on saved items, improperly saved items, etc) can be addressed. Once we have addressed these two issues, persistence can and will be moved from an \"opt-in\" feature, to a core function of DayZ - and something that is universal across all servers. Once this is complete, I personally look forward to truly seeing the \"camp/base building\" side of the title start to be more universally adopted. Be it vehicles, barricaded buildings, tents, containers, or even farms setup via horticulture. In addition, if you have any questions surrounding this topic (or any others) - I encourage you to head over to the Developer Discussion subforums at the official DayZ forums.

        "contents": "2015 We live in the future people. 2015 looks to be a pretty awesome year for DayZ, I'd like to kick off this months Status Reports by talking a bit about how the team has settled in during our first week back, as well as some awesome points of inspiration for us. First off, I was forwarded a link to Eternum Pictures DayZ fan film http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rJymZUtDUw - which has some outstanding emotional points about friendship, and loss. The loss that the main character in this fan film experiences is something that resonates with me. I can recall how it felt to meet, befriend, and then lose a stranger in my early DayZ mod days. As the option to instantly respawn after death somewhat limits this experience, it brought to the discussion table some server options that we've had on the drawing board for awhile. Speaking of servers... Over the next few months we'll be rolling out some expanded server options to extend support for administrators, and introduce more customization options for private shards. - Admin Logs, covering: Connections/Disconnections, Chat, Player Deaths (Env & PvP) - Hardcore Mode: Initially we'll only support this on Private Shards, while we see how the mechanics impact gameplay - However the intent is to offer server operators the choice to restrict how long since a players last death they can respawn. Eg: A hardcore server could conceptually restrict players from respawning until 12 hours after their last death. We'll gauge how much impact this has on the design, and decide if it stays restricted to private shards, or we open this up to all public (consumer rented) hive servers. Now that the team have returned back to the office we've begun going over data compiled from stable branch since Christmas, and looking at what is left to do for the 0.53 release at the end of January. We've got some awesome stuff on the table for 0.53 and 0.54, and as always we'll be pushing to experimental to test things out as development on the update progresses. Speaking of the end of January, PAX South in San Antonio is coming up and we have some awesome things in store for the first Penny Arcade Expo in the great state of Texas. We'll be sending out information on that via our twitter and facebook channels next week. In addition, the finishing touches are being put on the DayZ website - as we look to centralize where you all get the latest news on DayZ development, and interact with the DayZ Dev team. Over on the Official DayZ forums the team leads have begun using their new sub forums to interact directly with you, the Survivors of Chernarus. Head over and take a peak, we'll start to use these more and more - giving you guys a direct line to the people that guide the vision that is DayZ. forums.dayzgame.com I look forward to increasing visibility into DayZ development in 2014, and evolving what it means to survive in Chernarus as we march forward to DayZ 1.0. Chocolate Milk Bath, do it. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Peter / Lead Game Designer \"Welcome to the first devblog of the 2015, I hope you enjoyed the holidays and spent some quality time with your families, friends and DayZ! I will keep it really short. We all know that this year will be very important for DayZ. With all these big ongoing and upcoming changes it will be quite tough but the outcome will be splendid. Currently we are focused mainly on new controls/interactions. We would like to use them before we start switching character to the new animation system so we can identify possible issues with the old one and address them. Apart from that we are looking forward to the new scripting language which should be ready as soon as possible so we can start rewriting currently used scripts with it, optimize and polish them which also bring some performance boost (server side, yay!). Design for manual transmission for vehicles is ready for the review and when we settle down on last little things after discuss it with programmers its implementation will begin. We are also making a prototype for non intrusive group identification so that you can easily identify your companions. Have an amazing new year and don't forget... see you in Chernarus folks!\" Chris / Lead Artist \"Character Art: We're still working on new character clothing and new zombie templates. This is ongoing, long term work that occurs during luls when the art team isn't needed to support new features being added by design. We've finished the quilted jacket and a new batch of zombie templates. An M65 Field Jacket is also WIP. Environment: Work has begun on a school building. Its giving me flashbacks to my days dodging balls in the gym. We're working on desks, chairs, bells, and gym equipment. This is a piece I'm personally excited about. Weapons: We're nearly done with a new pump-action .22LR rifle based on the FN Trombone. We've also recently completed a Winchester Model 70 and two new guns I think people will be excited about are currently WIP. In addition, over the last couple of weeks, we've churned out a series of new melee weapons for people to try out.

Hey, it's still the zombie apocalypse after all. In the spirit of giving, Bohemia have also introduced more ways for players to off themselves in game&mdash;you can now despawn yourself&nbsp;with a suitable&nbsp;melee weapon. There are some nice new features in this seasonal update, including a bunch of Christmas trees in DayZ's major cities. You'll find mysterious&nbsp;pressies under these, just like in real life, though there's a greater chance of being murdered by a bandit as you rush to open them here. You can also now plant seeds wherever you like, rather than just in greenhouses, so long as you have the appropriate tools. As if that wasn't enough, several new locations have been added in the update, including a load of new villages and a few new&nbsp;mines.

To celebrate the milestone, Bohemia Interactive has released a video detailing the game's development as well as an updated roadmap for 2015.&nbsp; Regarding the latter, it looks like we'll be getting simple&nbsp;land vehicles in the first quarter of the new year, which is nice. You can look forward to catching diseases, too. In the second quarter both animals and vehicles will become more complicated, while a new user interface and physics system will be ushered in. During the third quarter traps, barricades and aerial transport are among the highlights, while we can expect (take a deep breath) animal companions late in the year. For the full roadmap check out the blog post&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dayzdev.tumblr.com/post/105357749796/one-year-of-dayz\">here</a>.&nbsp; Check out the video below: ",

The video provides a unique insight into the some of the challenges DayZ faced throughout its development, and what DayZ means to various members of the development team. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyZV3F6Vkho The standalone Alpha version of DayZ was officially released using Steam's Early Access program, on December 16th 2013 - very early on in its development cycle. Since then the DayZ development team has continued developing the game with a continuous flow of updates, including new weapons, new items, diseases, harvest-able resources, private shards, persistent objects, initial vehicle testing, and various platform improvements. Over the next 12 months, the team will be looking to expand the options for basic ground transportation, aerial transport, expanding on basic survival features, such as animal predators and traps. On top of these the DayZ team is implementing an improved rendering engine, which will expand upon the graphical fidelity and depth in game. Since the game was released into Early Access 12 months ago, the development team has grown significantly. David Durcak, the new Project Lead on DayZ, stated: “Firstly, I'd like to thank Dean Hall for leading the team for the past two years, and I wish him the best with his new studio. The growth of the DayZ team over the past 12 months will be integral to the prolonged success of the game. With the additional team members, we hope that throughout the upcoming year we will be able to create more content and a deeper experience for the DayZ audience. Plus, it will also enable us to significantly improve the technology for the standalone, and polish the features that we have. All in all, it is our goal to create the best experience we can, in terms of frame rate, visual quality and the overall gameplay.” In support of DayZ's first anniversary, the team has also released an updated development roadmap for 2015. The roadmap contains a list of the feature goals for 2015. Please note that the DayZ development roadmap is not a fixed document, and the schedule and content always remain subject to change: First Quarter Basic vehicles Advanced loot distribution New renderer New Infected AI Basic stealth system (infected and animals) Diseases Improved cooking and horticulture Advanced anti-hack system (Dynamic BattlEye) Second Quarter Advanced vehicles (repair and modifications) Advanced animals (life cycle, group behaviour) Player statistics New UI Player stamina Dynamic events World containers New physics system Third Quarter Traps Barricading Character life span + soft skills Animal predators + birds Aerial transport Console prototype Advanced communication Fourth Quarter Animal companions Steam community integration Construction (base building) Beta version To join the survivors in Chernarus, people can purchase DayZ (Early Access) for 27.99 EUR/34,99 USD from Steam and Store.bistudio.com. The price of DayZ will increase as development progresses. For more information, please visit http://www.dayz.com and/or follow DayZ on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.",

The 0.51 update to stable branch has had enough time to mature and reveal any critical bugfixes that need to be addressed for 0.52. With 0.52, the focus is on issuing bugfixes, incremental systems updates, and several new bits of content. One of the ongoing issues we've been focused on bugfixing with 0.52 is client and server crashes. Having spent a significant amount of time these last few weekends playing on stable branch servers I for one can attest to how frustrating these can be as a player. Especially the server crashes. In addition, as work on the central economy continues - there have been extensive cases on public hive servers with users abusing bugs to duplicate items. In order to combat this, we'll be taking a two point initiative at the beginning of 2015. Firstly, at the start of the year we will look at performing a wipe of the hive. Next, we will work with our game server provider partners to deploy a system for server operators that continues to allow them access to restarting their servers in the event of unforseen issues, but logs and tracks abusers of this option. Primary bug-fix focus for 0.52 is on the following issues: Item duplication Gunshot sounds Super-loot spawns Client crashes upon exit Server crashes Winners of the Private Shard contest should be receiving e-mails from Multiplay Game Servers shortly, please do not hesitate to reach out to support@dayzgame.com if you experience any issues. On a more personal note: Now that the programming team has resolved the issues with servers properly pulling the local time from their servers for the in-game clock, I encourage all of you to spend some time surviving during the night time. Get off the coast, go hunting, set up a tent somewhere in the woods and really spend some time experimenting with the \"hermit\" playstyle. We have a long way to go, but I've personally found the experience very rewarding as of late.

Fortunately they&#8217;re still almost as entertaining as, er, bleeding out whilst cowering behind a gravestone. &#8230; ",

Be it player to player interaction through the extension of the meat harvesting systems, or traveling together across the map in search of a V3S. For now the team is focused on critical bugfixes and server side performance optimization for 0.52 midway through December (due to the upcoming holiday season). For me, the first two quarters of 2015 hold a great deal of excitement. The last year has had a large amount of work ongoing behind the scenes that effect gameplay, and playability for a significant part of the active Early Access userbase. As someone that has spent over three thousand hours in Chernarus this year I am genuinely excited for the possibilities. Speaking of my time in Chernarus, as you all know the military tent (packable) was recently added into stable branch. This as I envision it is one among many possible \"persistent objects\" that survivors can find, and use to create their own base camp in Chernarus. Ranging from tents, to barriers, horticulture, containers, varied levels of fireplaces, and so much more - I see this feature expanding upon the initial pup tents of the mod into something that resembles a true improvised and -scalable- survivor camps. Speaking of survivor communities, our Private Shard contest has concluded and while I am happy to announce the winners - I have to say there were far more entries than I had expected, and the decisions were not at all easy. There are a lot of fantastic DayZ communities out there, and at the very least I now have a whole list of servers I need to take time to visit.

I especially love dry and flavourless patch notes. Games are neither dry nor flavourless, and that means these words contain secrets. For instance take a look at the new mechanics introduced in DayZ's latest stable patch: * Vehicles ;* Vehicles refueling ;* Prion Disease ;* New crafting recipes ;* Updated heat transfer ;* Watering plants; Ooh, nice, vehicles are in. And we've got some new crafting recipes. And... what's this? Neurodegenerative diseases? What's that all about? For explanation, we can turn to the update's added items: * V3S ;* Ghillie Suite (Hood, Bushrag, Top) ;* Ghillie Weapon Wrap ;* Jerry can ;* Military Tent ;* Human Flesh ;* Netting ;* Steyr Aug ;* MP133 with pistol grip ;* Burlap strips; Yup, you read that right: burlap strips. Also: human flesh. Essentially, you&nbsp;can now chomp down on a man steak. The functionality was originally introduced last month through an experimental update. Now it's in the game proper, along with the associated chance of catching Kuru if consumed raw. Which means, while you&nbsp;may have to suffer the indignity of being eaten by your killer, at least there's a chance you'll give him a degenerative disease&mdash;thus claiming revenge from beyond the game.&nbsp;Stay safe out there, folks. Patch&nbsp;0.51.125720 is now live.

Coming up next week we're aiming for the 0.51 update to stable branch, we have the conclusion of our Private Shard contest, and of course.. the initial implementation (at a very basic level) of wheeled vehicles into stable branch. It is important that when hunting for/fueling/driving these new base model V3S trucks across Chernarus you understand the limits, base functionality, and placeholder status of much associated at this time with the vehicle. The V3S is not tied to the persistence system at this time, so when it restarts - it respawns. Yes, worry not vehicles will save, just not at this time. Much of the animations are in progress, we hope to greatly improve the visual immersion versus legacy animations when mounting and exiting The interior of the cabin is still in progress, what is there currently is placeholder. Instrumentation will eventually be the primary method for tracking speed, fuel, temperature, etc New sound effects for the V3S will be recorded, for now we are using legacy placeholder sfx At this time the bed / cargo / command sections of the V3S and its variants are disabled while we continue work on them This means the truck has no item storage capacity, and seats two survivors (at this time!) Very basic functionality is present for vehicle maintenance, this is limited to fuel consumption and refilling. Further functionality is being worked on - spark plugs, exhaust, radiator, etc This first initial implementation of vehicles in DayZ is aimed at tracking the network impact, physical simulation performance, and gameplay impact of this feature on the title. Be warned, this is the first time stable branch will get its hands on these systems, and there will be bugs. As with all systems, we will be iterating and expanding upon this as we move forward with development of DayZ. Aside from the V3S, 0.51 contains a strong amount of new mechanics, expanded systems, security hotfixes, and as always content. Going into December, we will be observing the impact of this update on stable branch and work on a end of year update for December with 0.52 mid-month. On a more personal note, 0.51 - even with the title as early in development as it is has had a large impact on my playstyles within DayZ. I am very eager to see how survivors adapt and expand upon the world of Chernarus with these changes. In addition I hope to put a special status report up when 0.52 is published to stable branch (sort of a town hall style address) where myself, and the other leads recap the most impactful and persistent bugs in DayZ Early Access, and where we are / what the plans are for them moving into 2015.

        "contents": "<a href=\"/the-week/\"> </a> <em>Each Friday PC Gamer s editors gather around the charred carcass of a once living being, and argue the best and worst of the week between mouthfuls.</em> <strong>THE HIGHS</strong> <strong>Samuel Roberts: Maybe I ll play some Star Wars games this weekend</strong> We re not a film site so I won t dwell on today s trailer for Star Wars: Episode VII&mdash;The Force Awakens (which you have already watched and wasn t it fun?), but it s inspired me to explore the movies extraordinarily varied legacy of PC software. I roughly break down the videogames of Star Wars into three key eras: the arcade-y stretch that ran until the early 90s, the X-Wing/Dark Forces-driven golden age that ran right up until Episode I came out and the far more mixed modern era that yielded mostly nonsense, but a few highlights like <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/reinstall-star-wars-battlefront-ii/\">Battlefront</a> and KOTOR. Put simply, that trailer made me want to destroy shit in a Millennium Falcon this weekend&mdash;so it s going to have to be X-Wing: Alliance and a flight stick. But there s loads of great Star Wars games on PC that I m not even sure some people know are on PC. Did you know that the N64 s Rogue Squadron and Shadows of the Empire were quietly released on PC as well, for example? They re rough by today s standards, but the latter features my favourite interpretation of the Battle of Hoth and a brilliant two-stage boss fight with Boba Fett and Slave I involving a jet pack duel. Worth tracking down. <strong>Shaun Prescott: Embracing busywork in Dragon Age: Inquisition</strong> I m loving Dragon Age: Inquisition. I know because the other night I caught myself fiddling around with weapon and armor upgrades for about two hours, weighing up the differences between pommels and metal types. Then I spent another half hour digging up Drakestone. Then, while I moseyed about the Hinterlands in search of Elfroot, a dragon turned up. I fled. Cocky ice mage Solas tried to show the dragon a thing or two but I had to tell him no. We re not killing dragons right now, we re collecting Elfroot. Kill dragons on your own time, Solas. I don t have much time to play games after work, so usually I play through them as quickly as possible. I leave the busywork and collectibles usually: they re off-limits to me. That s not the case with Dragon Age because it s a beautiful world and I want to explore thoroughly. I ve not wanted to just be in a place like this since Dark Souls. There are a bunch of reasons the apocalypse is nigh in Inquisition, but there s also rings for grandmas to be found, and druffalo to be rounded up. The world can wait. <strong>Tim Clark: The real meaning of the holiday is double-screening DreamHack</strong> Having only decamped to the Americas earlier this year my other half and I (plus our <a href=\"http://dogcalledbatman.tumblr.com/\">furry familiar</a>) have no real connection to Thanksgiving, nor local family to spend it with. But do not weep for us, dear and constant reader, for we will still be giving thanks. And what we ll be thankful for is the chance to blow four straight days on eating food and playing games, untroubled by the clarion call of family gatherings or, y know, actual work. My plans include no-lifing Dragon Age: Inquisition and Far Cry 4, while she plans to plunge back into Azeroth by way of the Draenor Collector s Edition. Metaphorically I like to imagine this as being the equivalent of us wandering back into Hamsterdram , The Wire s unregulated drugtopia zone, and saying: Gimme all you got . While our binge occurs, I ll be watching DreamHack Winter play out on the second monitor. We previewed the CS:GO tournament <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dreamhack-winter-2014-csgo-preview-the-top-teams/\">here</a>, but it ll be the <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.se/dhw14/2014/11/24/hearthstone-championship-groups/\">Hearthstone tournament</a> that has my attention. L I F E C O A C H B O Y S. <strong>Tom Senior: Steam saaaaale!</strong> I haven t bought anything in the Steam so far this week, which is most unusual. Am I ill? It might be too early to say, and I don t want to jinx the magic, but I may have everything I want already. Maybe I own everything I need, and can now live the rest of my life free of want, and considerably wealthier for it. Maybe I should take a - ooooh, 50% off Endless Legend! Now that s one worth buying if you like interesting strategy games about knights from space and stuff. <strong>Tyler Wilde: Telltale s latest tale</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-one-zer0-sum-review/\">first episode of Tales from the Borderlands is really good</a>. In a little over two hours I came to like, and sort of even care about, its main characters&mdash;and these are characters in a universe I previously associated with sincere feelings such as I want to shoot that and Oh, that s wacky, eh? And maybe that s not totally fair to Borderlands, which I admit I ve only really skimmed while mildly drunk, but Telltale got me interested in its universe with so much more efficiency than the main series ever has. That s great for Telltale, and also for Borderlands&mdash;I even want to finish playing Borderlands 2 before the next episode so I m more familiar with the world. I probably won t, because y know, Dragon Age: Inquisition and Far Cry 4 need playing, but it matters that it inspired me, doesn t it? ",

Good news! <a href=\"http://dayz.com/\">DayZ</a>&#8216;s developers have laid out their <a href=\"http://dayz.com/blog/dayz-moving-into-2015\">development roadmap for 2015</a> and it includes long desired features, and should finally bring parity with and improvements over the original mod. These additions include basic vehicles and better zombie AI in early 2015, and eventually will stretch to construction and base building in late 2015. The game also has a projected final release date sometime in the first half of 2016. Bad news! The game&#8217;s price is going to increase gradually over the remaining development period and to begin with has increased from $30 to $35 and then immediately been discounted by 15% back down to $30 as part of the current Steam sale. Depending on your point of view this is either a nice way to soften the blow of an understandable and inevitable price increase or, in the UK at least, a breach of consumer protection guidelines. &#8230; ",

(Experimental) I wanted to preface this, as we are going out with vehicles this soon into their implementation, only to be sure that performance impact is as expected and we can continue on this course. Currently the vehicles (as a feature) are very rough, however the underlying structure is there. Ranging from visual bugs, to physics issues. You can expect anything. We are aware of most of them. Although the data for parts and some tech is there, the systems need to be configured. You can expect to drive the vehicle, use it for transport of you and your codriver from point A to point B. However for this experimental you dont need to repair anything and you can find vehicles easily. This will not be the case later in their development. We increased the number of available vehicles by a great amount so you can have fun and break them. Many issues are part of polish that will happen over time. Some of them are critical, thus will have higher priority. Please use our feedback tracker for any specific cases, with as much data as possible. It does help. Now to the core of the problems that you can expect with explanation of each and every one (Most of the systems have been rewritten and the development time has been invested into having proper underlying tech for the modules of the new engine) 1. Animations Wheels overturning is visual bug with animation source and simulation itself . Its annoying, however we do have to ignore it for this experimental. As for other animation bugs. We removed the move in/move out animation for the release and will fix the issues we were having with its implementation. The wheel and doors are animated however the visuals themselves might change. 2. Ragdoll/Collision/Physics Most of it is tuning of all the knobs (weight,suspension,force, and a lot more etc.) and finding solutions for problems that are out of the normal range. The results can be go from minor to catastrophic, like, vehicle moving from shooting, player force moving a vehicle, not having right friction and sliding improperly,getting stuck and killing the codriver sometimes. But than again its just tuning (and that takes time). The system is there and its robust (bullet sdk). Some of it is rare, some of it is much more common. Just understand that it will be better in next few weeks 3. Damage system The vehicle can be damaged , however its rather rudimentary and only a placeholder effect. With more advanced underlying tech introduced later. 4. Driving model The driving model (sliding and general feel of driving) is again matter of tuning. The underlying system is there and it works well. But it needs more time and dedicated work for the feel to get right. That is a big part of our work on vehicles. 5. Clipping Expect a lot of clipping issues with player gear and objects around in the game. It can range from minor to major issues. 6. Sounds All sounds are placeholders before we set up a proper recording of v3s. 7. Persistence Cars will be persistent in the future (once they are made of parts and repaired). This implementation however focuses more on data gathered from any desync or interaction with network code. 8. Crashes Client crashes can happen, and will happen. Be aware that you can run the client with the option of -dologs to create crash dumps that can be attached to feedback issues. If you do encounter them please report and give us as much information as you can.",

        "contents": "<a href=\"/minidayz-is-a-free-top-down-dayz/\"> </a> Bohemia Interactive has released a free version of DayZ. Sort of.&nbsp;It's MiniDayZ: a top-down, singleplayer take on DayZ's zombie survival. The game was originally a fan project, but has since been taken on by Bohemia. You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dayz.com/minidayz\" target=\"_blank\">play it in-browser</a>, although first you'll need to register for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://store.bistudio.com/minidayz\" target=\"_blank\">a Bohemia account</a>. Once inside, you'll be confronted by familiar needs. Your food and water meters will be dropping, and so you'll need to leave the coast&nbsp;to&nbsp;scavenge&nbsp;for items. Also: there are zombies. While you can punch them out slightly more effectively than in DayZ proper, doing so will almost certainly cause bleeding. Both guns and melee weapons can eventually&nbsp;be found. It's also a bit like DayZ in that the inventory is a pain in the ass. Still, it's a charming recreation, and a nice web-based distraction for when you're not able to journey into the human-filled world of the main DayZ. ",

        "contents": "Now that 0.50 has rolled out to stable branch, the focus of the team shifts to the incremental roll out of 0.51 for November’s monthly stable branch update. As with any monthly stable branch update, this comes with several new features, functional changes to existing systems, and its own unique collection of bugs and general game play issues. Those who encounter any frustrating blockers to their gameplay experience on either stable or experimental branch are encouraged to utilize the DayZ feedback tracker at feedback.dayzgame.com. Looking towards the 0.51 update and the Christmas break, in addition to the obvious feature and functional goals - Server side performance is paramount. Addressing critical issues and blockers in releasing 0.50 on schedule has resulted in reduced server performance and with our end of year feature/functional goals coming up the programming team is focused on ensuring a smooth and solid server side frame rate. Experimental/Unstable servers will be used to profile and test 0.51’s performance throughout the month, so if you are looking to participate in this stress testing - make sure to opt into Experimental branch! On experimental branch this week we’ve pushed out several new security related hotfixes, as well as pushing BattlEye’s upcoming changes. As always with security, working in tandem with our external partners (BattlEye and VAC) as well as observing exploits and behavior on experimental and stable branch servers allow us to iterate, and address via experimental > stable branch update paths. It is important again to understand that during the Early Access Alpha period of DayZ’s development vulnerabilities will be introduced as the engine and systems surrounding it are created. Addressing these vulnerabilities and iterating via the experimental > stable branch update path is a constant tug of war. Through utilizing the DayZ feedback tracker to properly report valid information and issues encountered surrounding these areas, we can more quickly “patch the holes” This Friday (the 14th) we had the first of our “dev play sessions” on experimental branch and the footage captured during this stream will be edited and commentated over in next weeks “dev experimental branch discussion” video to be released in next weeks Status Report. It is our hopes that combining general developer experimental branch gameplay with a “directors style commentary” alternating weekly will allow both the light hearted side of seeing the team play and experiment with systems in development, and the more serious gameplay and design oriented development discussion that the dev experimental branch discussion videos will allow. This paired with the upcoming restructuring of the Dev Hub, as well as moving the Status Reports to Fridays and rolling out “Update Notes” for Wednesday experimental branch releases (via the dev hub) will be the first step towards increasing community/developer interaction moving forward into 2015. Don’t forget about our private shard contest, announced during last weeks Status Report. Submissions are still being accepted! - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Peter / Lead Game Designer “Not much has changed since the last status report update on our front. Vehicle implementation is still flagged with the highest priority. There are of course some issues down the road which needs to be tackled to some extent so it can be considered ready to go for public testing. We advanced a bit as we were passed the vehicle physics parameters in configuration to set up car behavior correctly which is not an easy task and can take countless hours of tweaking and balancing to get the feeling right and believable. For example we already had iteration where our beloved “V3S” was acting like a boat or was falling on its sides while steering. At Thursday and Friday we had a visit from part of the Bratislava team here to talk about features and design. It was nice to have them there and discuss things in details - like animals, cooking and horticulture. In meantime we’ve added MP-133 with pistol grips and fixed walkie talkies. We also added one more way to gather meat. Apart from that there are some new issues with restraining and struggling which we are taking the care of now. We are also revisiting the way how the suicide was supposed to be working and if everything goes fine it will be seamlessly integrated into the gameplay at the end. Come get some… see you in Chernarus folks!” Chris / Lead Artist “This week, I’ve been working closely with Peter regarding design of the V3S and will be working on a high quality interior of the V3S with functional gauges. The initial implementation of the V3S will have some placeholder interior as the high quality version is being created. We have also finished the prison uniform and are closing in on finishing the prison complex, which will be an interesting area to explore. We plan to also create prison-themed zombies which you will have to face if you want to explore the facility. The Steyr AUG model is done and we will soon send it for animations, cfg, and sounds. I am optimistic that it can be in for next stable release but its worth saying that it will be the base version only. We are looking into swapping barrels to convert from the standard AUG to an HBAR version. The military tent is also finished. I expect it will be found in next stable release.” Standup Notes for the week of 10 Nov 14 (Note: Standup notes are not a change log - they are a quick high level look at tasks the teams worked on throughout this week) Art: • Prison Complex • High fidelity V3S instrument panel • Steyr AUG • Prison-themed zombies Animation: • Mp133 Pistol Grip Reload Animation done • Player Suicide Animations in Progress • Vehicle animations • Throwing in crouch and prone • Animation changes for new controls • Zombies with new AI • Vehicles Design: • Configs and scripts for new items (V3S Praga, MP-133 with pistol grips) • Fixing restrain/struggling • Fixing walkie talkies • Fixing suicide • Vehicles • Horticulture • Cooking • Damage system Programming: • Critical inventory fixes • Vehicle settings for physical simulations • New gamecontrols • Loot distribution improvements • Zombie/Animal AI • Player connection issues (possibility of attacking players before they can play) • Character duplication fixes",

While we do iterate weekly on experimental branch servers for both functional, and gameplay reasons many systems behave very differently when exposed to the much larger audiences on stable branch. Additionally, as we blaze ahead towards our end of year goals we will see performance server side bounce back and forth. We here on the DayZ development team endeavor to finish off the year with not only the additional features mentioned in last weeks status report, but with a healthy and steady server performance rate. As always, please use the feedback tracker when reporting issues and make sure to work with your game server provider's support if you are a DayZ server operator. That said, lets revisit last weeks comments regarding changes to how project updates and development info on DayZ is communicated to the Early Access survivors. As mentioned last week, we will be rolling out some changes to the DayZ.com website: Project Calendar Experimental & Stable branch updates Dev Streams Maintenance Status Reports Events Dev Hub will be moved to the landing page of DayZ.com to allow easier access to the latest news and updates about the development of DayZ Server Status widget/block - (This displays the current status of Stable and Experimental branches eg: Online / Offline) In addition to the changes to DayZ.com - we will be reapproaching how we handle the dev streams. We will continue with the dev team play sessions - however we will replace the alternating week play session / Q&A frequency with a dev blog / commentary style video that covers the teams commentary on the previous play session as well as discusses and shows things upcoming to experimental branch. As we roll these changes to DayZ.com and our dev streams / blogs out we will as always engage the community for feedback at the official DayZ.com forums. Lastly, as many may be aware - our game server partners recently started rolling out support for the renting of private shard servers on stable branch. To celebrate this, and coincide with the upcoming Christmas holiday we are looking for the best / strongest / most epic / generally most awesome communities. Do you have a DayZ squad, clan, server community, or otherwise group of rag tag survivors? We want to hear about it, and you. Tell us your tale at support@dayzgame.com and the top three entries by December 1st will win free server hosting for their group for a year from Multiplay Game Servers, as well as the option of private shards (also free) to go with it. (Subject: DayZ: Private Shard contest) Winners will be announced December 3rd in that weeks status report. - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Peter / Lead Game Designer \"With the delay of releasing stable version caused by crashes last week we entered a data freeze mode thus not many new things went into the experimental - mostly safe fixes or tweaks from our side. However work didn't stopped for the team. Currently we are working on enhancement of horticulture with fertilisers and protection against pests. Cooking is being prepared for refactoring and at the end gas cooker and fireplace will offer similar possibilities. Apart from that there are ongoing discussions about construction (base building), zombies AI, inventory and other aspects of the game. Vehicles. As nearly everyone is looking forward to them so I would like to disclose the current status of them a little. Vehicles implementation in the engine itself like handling, physics and other parts was completely written from scratch. We (design) finally got our hands on them as the programmers finished their work on basic needs and they will continue further with their work in parallel with ours. So far we have a driveable V3S with basic configuration in game along with some basic controls and our main focus now is to bring the initial implementation to the public as soon as possible. Of course as it will be just basic stuff for now I would like to point out that it will be not wise to await advanced features like complete repairing with full controls, all parts, upgrading, mounting points, shooting from vehicles and such. All this and much more will be ongoing iterative process like with everything and it will take a while to reach the final implementation so bear with us.

        "contents": "Over the next few weeks you will hopefully begin to see some small (but effective) changes to how the Status Reports, Dev Streams, and DayZ website are laid out. In order to facilitate this, the traditional format of our dev streams will change and the Status Report will begin to focus more on the tech side of DayZ, as well as the existing discipline soap boxes, and stand up notes. The DayZ website will soon feature an \"Early Access\" calendar covering our intended experimental and stable branch updates, play sessions, dev talks, special events, and consumer show attendance. That aside, this week hopefully sees the release of 0.50 to Stable Branch on steam. Paired with the recent support of private shards for consumer rented DayZ server instances and the ongoing drive for server performance enhancements we hope to finish off the first year of development on DayZ with a strong support for player communities. Persistent storage stability, as well as transportation, and A.I. redesign are goals we aim to be able to begin implementing into our steam branches before the Christmas holiday. As always, we will discuss the progress of these goals in our status reports and external communication moving forward. UPDATE: As mentioned via the DayZ Dev Twitter (@dayzdevteam) we are currently working to address issues encountered during pre release testing for 0.50 to stable branch. Current goals are aimed at a release during next weeks regularly scheduled maintenance, however we will keep you all updated as to the progress. In the mean time, experimental branch is updated with the latest 0.50 build - for volume and stress testing prior to next weeks maintenance window. Make sure to check the DayZ dev hub weekly, and keep an eye out for the changes to DayZ.com - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Peter / Lead Game Designer \"The end of the month is around the corner and that means only one thing: After the three experimental releases in a row it's a time to deliver the latest stable branch update to DayZ. The Last few days we were fixing the last few issues here and there and polishing current state of the internal dev branch version so it can be distributed to stable branch and shine there for another month. As well I can tell you that you will have plenty of stuff to try and do. Let me recap quickly the features and content added to the game this month for you. With proper tools you are able now to plow the soil in the greenhouses and plant the seeds which will grow into plants and produce crops which can be picked. For this initial iteration of horticulture we went with tomato plants and with the fixed placement, in the near future we will add more plants and planting spots will become arbitrary. After doors were re-implemented in the engine we were able to add opening/closing sound effects to them as well as locking/unlocking their locks with lock picks which is the very first basic iteration of barricading. Doors can be also unlocked with brute force so don't worry that someone will lock you up and leave you for dead. Taking care of your character was also extended with shoes degradation which is dependent on shoes durability, surface roughness they are used on, movement speed and distance walked. Character exposure to weather, temperature and wetness was tweaked and with addition of heat packs even snipers must not fear they will freeze out during their camping. Also other features were expanded as well, repairing items and clothes with duct tape and leather sewing kit. You can also use sewing kits to stitch your wounds. New animals were added as well, you can meet new the goat and hen now in Chernarus. As far as new items goes I just mention some of them. From weapons there is a set of long awaited ones containing MP-133, R92, AK-74, AKS-74U and as a bonus the handy Derringer. For melee usage there is sledgehammer, and brass knuckles. Clothes were enriched with now complete firefighter uniform and other pieces. Backpacks have also some newcomers like SPOSN and waterproof backpacks. We fixed some ongoing annoying issues like struggling from restrains, seeing thru burlap sack when logged in with it on head, unconsciousness compatibility with both states, character drowning, fireplace and tent placing, container inception and many more. I teased you in the last status report that I'll write something about the upcoming new inventory. Current inventory is good and is doing fine but there are some little flaws. What I especially like is the micromanagement of items in given space which provide nice immersion - it's not just some text list and I also like easy usage of it with drag and drop functionality. We would like to expand on good sides and rectify not sufficient ones like virtual hands slot or some inconsistencies in manipulation with inventory in general. With new inventory system we will be able to do things like creating container on any object, locking it, dynamically change it's capacity, dynamically change number of quick-bar slots according to given container and a lot more, maybe rotating items will be possible as well. Our senior designer Jan Tomasik is currently playing with GUI layout of inventory screen and here is what he has to say: \"Horizontally oriented inventory uses better screen space of nowadays 16:9 monitors. This layout reduce necessity to scroll through inventory to minimum and doesn't obscure view on players character and its surroundings. Player has better overview of items he posses and time for all management of loot is significantly reduced. Inventory is fully modular so it fits even on 4:3 and offers future possibility to be even organizable by players themselves. All slot sizes are same through whole UI so player is always sure whether item fits in slot or not. Player can choose whether he wants to have avatar panel on left or right side of the screen and can also organize order of containers.\". You can see Jan's concept of horizontal layout in attached screenshot on the official DayZ website (http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-week-of-27-oct-14), of course the visuals are just temporary mockup. Enjoy the new stable release and in the meantime... see you in Chernarus folks! \" Viktor / Lead Animator \"The animation team has been busy bringing new animations to the game like reloading for derringer, wringing clothes, using grenades, flares and chemlights and other. We have also slightly redesigned the sitting animations. The new pose greatly reduces amount of clippings when holding pistols, one handed and two handed items. There is also progress with the new zombies as they are internally running around using new systems. The animation graph and AI now has to be improved so it can start using new animations. Last weeks we had many discussions about some great stuff coming to the game. One I am most excited about is the injured player also known as limping animations already showed a while ago. It wasn't the right time to bring this to the game yet because it is very tied to many systems and most of the default animations have to be done and finalized first. We have agreed on how many injured stages there will be and also we would like to represent some illnesses with an animations like cough, sneeze, fever and more. To be clear this is something we won't get sooner then sometime next year. But I'm sure it's worth the wait.\" Standup Notes for the week of 27 Oct 14 Design: Bugfixing before stable release Configs and scripts for new items Polishing current state of things Loot tables maintenance Loot distribution Crafting Controls Inventory Vehicles Zombie AI Programming: Critical inventory fixes Vehicle control New gamecontrols Door states persistency Loot distribution improvements Zombie/Animal AI ",

        "contents": "Over the next few weeks you will hopefully begin to see some small (but effective) changes to how the Status Reports, Dev Streams, and DayZ website are laid out. In order to facilitate this, the traditional format of our dev streams will change and the Status Report will begin to focus more on the tech side of DayZ, as well as the existing discipline soap boxes, and stand up notes. The DayZ website will soon feature an \"Early Access\" calendar covering our intended experimental and stable branch updates, play sessions, dev talks, special events, and consumer show attendance. That aside, this week hopefully sees the release of 0.50 to Stable Branch on steam. Paired with the recent support of private shards for consumer rented DayZ server instances and the ongoing drive for server performance enhancements we hope to finish off the first year of development on DayZ with a strong support for player communities. Persistent storage stability, as well as transportation, and A.I. redesign are goals we aim to be able to begin implementing into our steam branches before the Christmas holiday. As always, we will discuss the progress of these goals in our status reports and external communication moving forward. UPDATE: As mentioned via the DayZ Dev Twitter (@dayzdevteam) we are currently working to address issues encountered during pre release testing for 0.50 to stable branch. Current goals are aimed at a release during next weeks regularly scheduled maintenance, however we will keep you all updated as to the progress. In the mean time, experimental branch is updated with the latest 0.50 build - for volume and stress testing prior to next weeks maintenance window. Make sure to check the DayZ dev hub weekly, and keep an eye out for the changes to DayZ.com - Brian Hicks / Lead Producer Peter / Lead Game Designer \"The end of the month is around the corner and that means only one thing: After the three experimental releases in a row it's a time to deliver the latest stable branch update to DayZ. The Last few days we were fixing the last few issues here and there and polishing current state of the internal dev branch version so it can be distributed to stable branch and shine there for another month. As well I can tell you that you will have plenty of stuff to try and do. Let me recap quickly the features and content added to the game this month for you. With proper tools you are able now to plow the soil in the greenhouses and plant the seeds which will grow into plants and produce crops which can be picked. For this initial iteration of horticulture we went with tomato plants and with the fixed placement, in the near future we will add more plants and planting spots will become arbitrary. After doors were re-implemented in the engine we were able to add opening/closing sound effects to them as well as locking/unlocking their locks with lock picks which is the very first basic iteration of barricading. Doors can be also unlocked with brute force so don't worry that someone will lock you up and leave you for dead. Taking care of your character was also extended with shoes degradation which is dependent on shoes durability, surface roughness they are used on, movement speed and distance walked. Character exposure to weather, temperature and wetness was tweaked and with addition of heat packs even snipers must not fear they will freeze out during their camping. Also other features were expanded as well, repairing items and clothes with duct tape and leather sewing kit. You can also use sewing kits to stitch your wounds. New animals were added as well, you can meet new the goat and hen now in Chernarus. As far as new items goes I just mention some of them. From weapons there is a set of long awaited ones containing MP-133, R92, AK-74, AKS-74U and as a bonus the handy Derringer. For melee usage there is sledgehammer, and brass knuckles. Clothes were enriched with now complete firefighter uniform and other pieces. Backpacks have also some newcomers like SPOSN and waterproof backpacks. We fixed some ongoing annoying issues like struggling from restrains, seeing thru burlap sack when logged in with it on head, unconsciousness compatibility with both states, character drowning, fireplace and tent placing, container inception and many more. I teased you in the last status report that I'll write something about the upcoming new inventory. Current inventory is good and is doing fine but there are some little flaws. What I especially like is the micromanagement of items in given space which provide nice immersion - it's not just some text list and I also like easy usage of it with drag and drop functionality. We would like to expand on good sides and rectify not sufficient ones like virtual hands slot or some inconsistencies in manipulation with inventory in general. With new inventory system we will be able to do things like creating container on any object, locking it, dynamically change it's capacity, dynamically change number of quick-bar slots according to given container and a lot more, maybe rotating items will be possible as well. Our senior designer Jan Tomasik is currently playing with GUI layout of inventory screen and here is what he has to say: \"Horizontally oriented inventory uses better screen space of nowadays 16:9 monitors. This layout reduce necessity to scroll through inventory to minimum and doesn't obscure view on players character and its surroundings. Player has better overview of items he posses and time for all management of loot is significantly reduced. Inventory is fully modular so it fits even on 4:3 and offers future possibility to be even organizable by players themselves. All slot sizes are same through whole UI so player is always sure whether item fits in slot or not. Player can choose whether he wants to have avatar panel on left or right side of the screen and can also organize order of containers.\". You can see Jan's concept of horizontal layout in attached screenshot on the official DayZ website (http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-week-of-27-oct-14), of course the visuals are just temporary mockup. Enjoy the new stable release and in the meantime... see you in Chernarus folks! \" Viktor / Lead Animator \"The animation team has been busy bringing new animations to the game like reloading for derringer, wringing clothes, using grenades, flares and chemlights and other. We have also slightly redesigned the sitting animations. The new pose greatly reduces amount of clippings when holding pistols, one handed and two handed items. There is also progress with the new zombies as they are internally running around using new systems. The animation graph and AI now has to be improved so it can start using new animations. Last weeks we had many discussions about some great stuff coming to the game. One I am most excited about is the injured player also known as limping animations already showed a while ago. It wasn't the right time to bring this to the game yet because it is very tied to many systems and most of the default animations have to be done and finalized first. We have agreed on how many injured stages there will be and also we would like to represent some illnesses with an animations like cough, sneeze, fever and more. To be clear this is something we won't get sooner then sometime next year. But I'm sure it's worth the wait.\" Standup Notes for the week of 27 Oct 14 Design: Bugfixing before stable release Configs and scripts for new items Polishing current state of things Loot tables maintenance Loot distribution Crafting Controls Inventory Vehicles Zombie AI Programming: Critical inventory fixes Vehicle control New gamecontrols Door states persistency Loot distribution improvements Zombie/Animal AI ",

        "contents": "Games with permadeath &#8212; wherein you start over completely when you die &#8212; provide certain stakes to a gaming session. Rather than reloading your last save after you die, you lose all your gear, you lose all your progress, and you essentially lose all the time you&#8217;ve spent playing up to that point. For a while now (a couple years, to be honest) I&#8217;ve been thinking about a way to up those stakes, to go a step beyond perma-death: <em>perma</em>-permadeath, where dying means you don&#8217;t just lose your stuff, you lose the game itself. Forever. <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/survival-week/\">Survival Week</a> on RPS seems like an apt time to finally give it a try.

        "contents": "The subject of the central economy has been one of varied opinions within the community. The idea of centralized control over both rare items, and quantity control over more common items of loot is very polarizing. As we look towards the remaining months left in 2014, the team has been discussing our intended goals and level of functionality desired from the loot spawning system, and the central hives' control over it. As the current behavior for the spawning and respawning of loot is a placeholder system and the limits of this form are very visible when observing the current behavior on experimental branch servers we have outlined the following goals for the final functionality with the programming, and design teams: Control over quantity per server instance for rare / high value items (Eg: M4A1, SVD, etc) Loot table control per region/area type rather than per building class name Even distribution of loot economy across the whole of Chernarus As work moves forward on deploying the intended functionality into loot spawning/respawning, server side stats analysis will allow fine adjustments to the system to be made, and experimental branch updates on a weekly basis will allow us to iterate, and volume/stress test against a large user base.

I'm hoping that we will find a way to add the milky way spiral arm visible in the night sky to our game. Work continues on several new character pieces (women's clothing, prison uniform, medical scrubs, craftable clothing and new zombie types) as well as various environment models which I have mentioned previously (new heli crash site, objects for the NEAF, building signs, other props). The Derringer, AK74M, AKS74U and MP133 with pistol grips have all been passed to the animators, designers and sound team for their part to be completed. We are still be on course to add 5.45mm ammo and the AK74 before the end of October.\" Peter / Lead Designer \"The art team has completed several new weapons and delivered the assets to the animation and design teams. One of these new items is one quite a special case, which we need to figure out how to do properly and it's a flare gun. So in the meantime you will get other dangerous toys to play with. By the way do you remember that little useful item from the mod which was used to heat yourself up?

Previously, I had mentioned the new controls system which is currently being worked on and we have working prototype of it already. You are probably curious what changes it will brings to game and way it's played. We are focused to make the controlling of your character as fluent as possible so there will be no immersion breaking due to clunky controls. That means we want to eliminate user action menu, or at least have this possibility just for very special cases. Usage of items will be driven contextually, let's say you have an apple in your hand and you invoke action by pressing and holding use button - if you are pointing on someone you will start to feed him while you are holding the use button, if not then you will start eating it by yourself - when you release you will stop the action. You will be able to use items even during movement. Still have that half-eaten apple in hand when zombie suddenly appear? Just hit him hard with that apple in your hand - yes all items (of course firearms too) can became melee weapons. New controls allow us also to expand melee system which we are considering to do with addition of two types of attacks - fast and charged, or to add push instead of fast attack. We will see how the prototype of these goes and how it will play with server performance and synchronization in general. Next time I will talk a little bit about the new inventory too. As usual apart from such exciting stuff we made some fixes such ammo-box container inception and other smaller ones.

        "contents": "This week we'll talk about infected AI, and our plans for the next few months regarding these systems. Looking forward towards our October stable branch update (0.50) and on-wards to the November update we plan on slowly implementing the next iteration of A.I. for the infected into our experimental and later stable branches. The intent with this iteration is focused on several key points for gameplay: Stealth as a viable method of tactics vs infected A.I. Vastly reduced range-of-vision Smaller corner to corner cone of vision Infected hearing ability refactored to compliment stealth as viable gameplay method The impact of the intended new behavior extends past the obvious gameplay areas and into server performance and navmesh compliance. As the gameplay programming team begins the process of implementing this new system into DayZ, so will begin the process of removing the legacy A.I. system used prior. Starting fresh with this new system should reduce the load on the DayZ server process and allow us to begin experimenting with new methods of distributing the infected, as well as increasing the amount of infected spawned per server instance.

        "contents": "This week we'll talk about infected AI, and our plans for the next few months regarding these systems. Looking forward towards our October stable branch update (0.50) and on-wards to the November update we plan on slowly implementing the next iteration of A.I. for the infected into our experimental and later stable branches. The intent with this iteration is focused on several key points for gameplay: Stealth as a viable method of tactics vs infected A.I. Vastly reduced range-of-vision Smaller corner to corner cone of vision Infected hearing ability refactored to compliment stealth as viable gameplay method The impact of the intended new behavior extends past the obvious gameplay areas and into server performance and navmesh compliance. As the gameplay programming team begins the process of implementing this new system into DayZ, so will begin the process of removing the legacy A.I. system used prior. Starting fresh with this new system should reduce the load on the DayZ server process and allow us to begin experimenting with new methods of distributing the infected, as well as increasing the amount of infected spawned per server instance. As well, the changes in A.I. navigation in complex scenarios should have a strong positive impact on the positioning of infected A.I. when players attempt to trap/ditch/elude them in and around structures and terrain features.

        "contents": "http://dayz.com/blog/status-report-week-of-06-oct-14 With the experimental branch updates on 0.50 rolling out this week, Raist and Eugen have worked together to deploy additional data tracking methods that should aid fine tracking and design adjustment related to player movement. Previously the team had focused most of our data tracking methods on loot distribution, spawning, and so forth - as we move closer towards the deployment of vehicles, expansion of existing persistent objects, and the central loot economy we will continue to use experimental branch and official stable branch servers to guide the design of gameplay mechanics via player movement, death, and camp analysis. http://i.imgur.com/8YuI2nc.jpg The above image shows the concentration of player deaths within a 12 hour period on one Experimental Branch 0.50 server. As you can see, the expected large amount of player deaths occur along the player spawn points. However, what is increasingly fascinating is the large spread of unique player deaths across the map. From as far out as Kamenka, to Tulga, Skalisty Island, and Devil's Castle. I like to imagine the lone player death at Green Mountain was an epic last stand gun fight, but we may never know. In addition to the obvious value to the data above, analyzing data like this will become increasingly valuable for the development of core gameplay systems, as well as Chernarus Plus over the coming days and months. In addition to the work done on player data tracking, the gameplay programming team has worked hard on increasing server side performance optimization as well as server side security updates related to player position tracking. 0.49 introduced a good deal of server side performance enhancements, and addressed quite a few critical issues with stability. However, with these fixes came several new issues that we hope to see resolved with the stable release at the end of the month. We hope to finish out October with 50 player servers, persistence enabled by standard, and faster server performance across all servers on stable branch. As we progress along our goals in October, the status reports will keep the player base updated on these goals and any potential blockers or delays. - Brian Hicks / Producer Chris / Lead Artist \"Tech: Work continues on fixing the graphical bug associated with our 3D camo and it has turned out to be more troublesome than originally thought. While the programmers were tinkering around with the shaders in search of a fix, we were able to have an additional channel added to the shader used for most of the loot items which will allow us to procedurally change the color of objects via config. The designers will evaluate how and when to implement such a feature but I am hopeful it will lead to a lot more color customization options on a lot more items than we currently allow. We also got support for a colorize in the grass shader so that we can vary the color of patches of grass in a large field, adding some visual flare to the environment. Character Art: The first women's clothing item is done: 3/4 length pants. It will be added in the no-so distant future, along with women's shorts and a sweater. The prison uniform, which was paused pending a few high priority tasks, is WIP again. We will have to pause the creation of new zombie types temporarily to work on some tweaks to the skeleton, which were asked for by the programming and animation team, related to new zombie AI/animation triggers. The team in Bratislava is working on various crafted items from leather which I hope will be interesting to people who like to play in more of a PvE style. Weapons: The Derringer art is ready and will soon be ready to be passed along the chain: animations, sound, cfg. The AKS74U and AK74M are being polished along with the art assets related to 5.45mm ammo. I have set this as a goal for myself - that by the end of October the AK74 family will debut on experimental. \" Viktor / Lead Animator \"After introducing one handed pistol animations many visual bugs had to be fixed to provide smooth and polished experience. Part of that is polishing and replacing some unarmed moves while standing. First of upcoming minor changes is a new unarmed sprint and unarmed run should follow. When we finalize those we can polish other animations like running with binoculars, pistols and other one handed items. We are still processing the last mocap animations as these should be ready for improved zombie ai. Many new attack for zombies are being created so we can prototype and test different zombie combat situations. We already have a first iteration of tools for new animation system and it looks great. If all goes as planned we would like to introduce zombies on the new system as soon as it will be possible. After all, we already have a deer running around using new system (just internally for now) and it's already visible improvement. But it is still a long way to go until we can use all of the great features of the new animation system.\" Peter / Lead Designer \"Last week was pretty hectic. We brought a bunch of different assets from our backlog to the game like the leather sewing kit so you can finally repair your leather clothes and shoes, RDG2 tube also known as smoke grenade, sardines - this time alive not canned, welding and firefighter helmet to cover your head, brass knuckles and sledgehammer to crunch some bones. All of these things should spawn in game along with long time awaited MP-133 and R92. As well, a good amount of bug fixing tasks were addressed. For example better placement of tents which takes surrounding collisions into account to allow for more intelligent pitching of tents in wild places. Proper placement of wrecks created by dynamic events. Allowing or forbidding of fireplaces to be ignited in some places. Temperature and wetness fixes and tweaks. Apart from that we also opened discussion which will help us to outline construction design and it's mechanics. We are analyzing what's possible and where the borders are so we can decide upon crucial things like how they will be placed - freely or grid based? What the granularity of objects will be - down to logs, whole walls or perhaps complete floors? How the crafting of these objects will be done - just a recipe or actually stacking. There are many important things which will define player experience of creating, using and ambushing bases.

We saw Donkey Kong Country recreated in the engine earlier this week, but now cast your eyes across this work-in-progress attempt to adapt DayZ's core gameplay into a 20-year old engine. DoomZ is the work of a modder disenchanted with the limitations of DayZ in its current, Enfusion-powered iteration. While Zdoom obviously has limitations of its own, it looks like the mod is making steady progress. The mod currently boasts a day and night cycle, a rather charming UI (see the image above), wildlife, fires and cooking, water, weapons, food, limb damage and much, much more. The goal is to make the game as close to the DayZ gameplay model as possible, though given the engine's limitations there won't be vehicles. Creator Robert Prest writes that the mod could move over to GZdoom, allowing for more flexibility in map design. As for the video below, Prest provides pretty good commentary on what the project is now and where it's headed. Alpha 11 can be downloaded right now. Cheers to Kotaku for the heads up. ",

In many respects it's the architect for modern survival gaming, and, in many other respects, we still have no idea what its final form will even be. Neither the Arma 2 mod nor the standalone early access release are in a finished state, and that's led to some concern within its community. Brian Hicks, producer for DayZ, recently addressed these concerns in a forum thread titled, \"has anyone else lost faith in DayZ?\" Here's what Hicks had to say: \"You are not playing DayZ, you are playing development builds. Early development builds. \"DayZ is 11 months into principle development, on what should be a 3 year standard development cycle. I can't force you to be a fan of DayZ, but I can call this out: \"Defining or judging what DayZ is by a build so early in its development is much a kin to judging a painting within the first few brush strokes. Hell, even Bob Ross's paintings didn't look great for the first few minutes (until you realized what it was he was making). \"I can promise you none of your favorite AAA games played, or even resembled the final product that early in their cycles. (Okay, maybe some of the larger titles that push small incremental updates out every 12 months - but we all know those are special snowflakes.) \"Take a break, and come back in beta or even the full release. The Early Access period of development will have many peaks and low, low valleys. This is the nature of software development. Yes, it is stressful as heck - for all of us, but you get to be part of shaping the DayZ experience.\" Later in the thread, Hicks clarified his three-year standard development cycle comment. \"I'm always careful with what I say - 3 year standard development cycle, meaning in standard terms this would be a 3 year, closed development cycle. Early Access changes a lot of that, I don't need to tell you. We are still aiming for end of 2014 to hit our beta phase entry. You can be certain the weekly status reports will keep everyone updated on that. \"We're trying to effectively do a 3 year standard cycle in 2 to 2.5 years. It might be a lofty goal, but as long as I have something to say about it - you will all be kept updated as to what is going on.\" I have to say, I broadly agree with Hicks's position. DayZ launched into Early Access with an all-caps warning that player's shouldn't purchase unless they were willing to deal with issues and interruptions along its development road-map. I have, I'd argue, already wrangled enough fun out of the game to justify that purchase, and, while I'm among the group now holding off for the beta release, I'm hopeful that it'll be worth the wait.",

This week you may encounter two villages that weren't there before, as well as a new World War II monument in Severograd, which is pleasant. There are also a series of new animations and crafting options. \"You can craft a leather sack,\" the patch notes proudly declare. You can also make a mosin wrap from a burlap sack. You can now put grass in burlap sacks. Sack enthusiasts have no doubt barracked for these changes for many, many months. New animations include igniting fireplaces, restrained runs, fishing and cow animation. But in the end, the significance of any change depends on how you play DayZ, so for your convenience the full patch notes: KNOWN ISSUES: Player is unable to attack with any weapon under certain circumstances Character freezes for a few seconds after throwing an item under certain angle Players experience desync when engaged in melee combat while their network bubbles overlap Random throwing of items Ladders can't be used after hit by a grenade explosion Player is stuck in building after reconnect Player cannot respawn properly after drowning When restrained while unconscious player stays restrained until he reconnects Character goes prone after using drink all action on canteen Random police car spawning doesn't work properly. Cars are not visible, loot is there though. NEW: Animations: Igniting fireplace Animations: Restrained sprint (run) Animations: Fishing (pull out, check, start) Animations: Searching for berries, digging Animations: Cow animation sets Crafting: You can craft leather sack Crafting: You can craft mosin wrap from burlap sack Crafting: You can add grass to burlap wrap Crafting: You can sharpen wooden sticks Crafting: You can combine sharpened sticks and feather to create a primitive arrow Crafting: Preparing chicken will now also give you some chicken feathers Crafting: You can saw mosin-nagant 9130 off Crafting: You can paint sawn-off mosin-nagant 9130 Crafting: You can tear bandana mask into rags Crafting: You can attach and detach Smersh Backpack to Smersh Vest Gear: Crafted leather sack Gear: Smersh Vest Gear: Smersh Backpack Gear: Sharpened Stick Gear: Chicken Feathers Gear: Primitive Arrow Gear: Added lifetime and persistence parameters Gear: Bow can now use primitive arrows Gear: Tank helmet Loot: Randomized police cars spawns (works but cars are not always visible - see known issues) Loot: Some guns spawn with ammo now Weapons: Sawed-off variant of mosin-nagant 9130 World: Sinistok village is added.

Dean Hall emerged on stage to announce a Playstation 4 version of DayZ. More than that, Hall took time to explain how the console port of the popular survival game would also enhance the existing PC version. \"When we were considering console versions, we were acutely aware of how important the PC version is to us,\" Hall said on-stage. \"We didn't want to just port DayZ, but to develop the game to each platform's strengths. Commitment to the Playstation 4 version has given us cause to expand the parameters of the overall project, providing benefit to the existing PC early access.\" Hall pointed to the provision of 64-bit servers as one such example of the increased scope of the project, and also announced a visual overhaul. \"We're now committed to developing an entirely new cross-platform renderer to bring amazing new visuals to the game,\" he said. \"Through an adaptable approach and development environment, this addition will allow not only Playstation 4 owners to get into DayZ, but it will improve all DayZ player experiences.\" For all the Gamescom news, click the link that takes you to all the Gamescom news.",

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/24/dayz-diary-the-fishing-trap/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to DayZ diary: the fishing trap\"> </a> As DayZ slowly winds its way through alpha, we're finally beginning to see more updates to the early access zombie survival game, with new items and features being regularly added. Mechanics for hunting, fishing, crafting, and cooking mean there are now new ways to thrive and survive in the post-apocalyptic landscape of Chernarus besides simply scrounging around in buildings for canned food or shooting and looting other players. I thought I'd try surviving by relying exclusively on these new tools. Instead of guns, I'd try to use a crossbow to take down some deer. Instead of peeling open canned tuna I'd try to pluck fish from ponds. No more cold beans: I'd cook my food over a roaring fire or gas-powered stove. A quiet little camping trip: that's all I wanted. Robbery, murder, betrayal, and bad luck: that's what DayZ gave me instead. Part one: the gear I could run straight out into the woods and survive simply by picking apples and berries (now available from certain trees and bushes) and by drinking water from ponds, but if I want to hunt, fish, and cook, I'm going to need gear, and quite a bit of it. That means my woodland adventure needs to begin by raiding a few small towns and buildings, and with that comes facing the mild threat of zombies and as well as DayZ's true danger: other players. I pick a high population server (I don't want this to be too easy) and fresh-spawn near the revised Northeast Airfield, which has been recently transformed from a military installation into a civilian airstrip with a few industrial buildings and a control tower. Luck is with me: it's both empty of players and appears to be un-looted. I make off with some great outdoor gear: a crossbow (though no arrows), a couple of water bottles (which I can refill from ponds and even from falling rain), a portable gas lamp (which needs a gas canister), and an bulky orange mountain backpack to hold it all. Might have more luck with the cap off. I don't dawdle: despite the changes to the NEAF, it's still a highly-trafficked area and if there aren't players here currently, they're definitely on their way. I head into the trees to the northwest, aiming for the northern road that will lead me all the way across the map. Along the way, I come across something I've never seen before: what appears to be a half-finished gas station in a clearing in the woods. It's weird, but I'm glad I found it, because in the trunk of an abandoned car I find one of the game's more elusive items: a fishing lure. Not so much gas pumps as helium pumps, apparently. I reach the north road and run west for a good twenty minutes, looting the series of scattered barns, sheds, and garages as I go. I find a farming hoe and use it to dig up earthworms for bait. In another garage I find a rope, and further on I find an axe. I use the axe to cut down an Ashwood tree, which gives me a pole. I tie the rope to the pole, and I've got an improvised fishing rod (you can also craft a longbow from the same materials), then combine a worm with my lure and attach it to the pole. Bingo! I'm ready to fish. Finally, something I can pwn: worms. One small wrinkle: I'm now in the northwest corner of the map, which has a distinct lack of ponds (and a distinct lack of everything else: even the tiny town that used to exist out here has been removed, leaving only a solitary water pump). The only pond I can think of is west of Vybor, south of here. Vybor has grown busier recently: with military weapons becoming more rare and player spawn-points spreading further inland, there's much more foot traffic in Vybor lately than there has been in ages. I'll have to proceed carefully. Fishing tip: look both ways before crossing a field. I skirt past the bus depot, then crouch nearby, peering down at it, wondering if I should loot it. If I catch a fish I'll need to cook it, and I still have neither matches for a fire nor a portable stove or cooking pot. While I'm watching the depot for activity, I hear a sharp crack from my left and my screen goes black. Someone's shot me, most likely from a cluster of trees north of Lopatino or perhaps even from the same stand of bushes I'm squatting in. Just like that, I'm dead. Everything I've spent the morning collecting is gone. Part two: the catch Okay, then! It appears I crouched in the wrong bush while looking in the wrong direction. After a long, deep sigh, I put my deceased character out of my head and respawn in Dubrovka, a small town that would be perfect to loot for starter gear except that it's already been picked clean by other players. I head north toward Krasnostav, thinking I'll raid a few buildings there before heading west to the town of Gvozdno, but due to the sun being hidden by the clouds, I accidentally wind up running east. I realize my mistake only when I come across a sign that informs me, dreadfully, that I'm on the outskirts of a place where fresh-spawns go to die: Berezino. How did they spot me? My red cap and purple backpack, perhaps? I carefully raid some of the buildings on Berezino's outskirts, making my way north toward Khelm. Berezino being Berezino, though, I run into other players almost immediately. They're semi-geared, but thankfully friendly, and after a brief conversation they wish me a safe trip and head into town to look for trouble. Less friendly is the zombie who assaults me while I'm picking berries, and my apple-picking is abruptly ended as well when I hear a long gout of gunfire a few blocks away. Uh, thanks for the help, but I've got it. Okay. I'm being stupid. I bolt from Berezino, and make it through Khelm safely, filling my pack with odds and ends. Then I get stupid again, pressing my luck by hitting the NEAF for the second time today. This time, I'm not the only one there. Fishing tip: people in masks are horrible. I don't really mind being held up in DayZ. A lot of times, the muggers just want to make sure you're not a threat, or just want to mess with you a bit. I'm not a fan of being handcuffed, however, and I'm also not a fan of the N-word, which one of the bandits uses repeatedly while preparing to cuff me. So, camping be damned: I take out my machete and start running around wildly while hacking at them. I'm eventually shot dead, but I know I got a couple cuts in: as I lie there in the darkness, I hear one player frantically ask the other for a bandage. Bleed, jerk. Bleed all of your stupid blood. Part three: the bait This is quite a fishing trip so far, huh? I spawn quite close to Krasno this time, and the impulse to find a gun any gun and return to the nearby airfield to put some holes in those two masked dickweeds is almost overpowering. I remind myself: you're here to fish. With great effort, I turn and head west through town, though I do stop at the police station just in case there's a firearm there. There isn't. I'm wearing a police jacket. But I'm clearly under arrest. I'm stopped a few minutes later by someone else with a gun, though he tells me not to worry, he's not going to hurt me, and we chat for a bit, just long enough for his friend, who I didn't see, to run up behind me and hit me in the back of the head with an axe. Clever girl. Not so clever me. Part four: the snag I'm starting to feel like a fish myself, a fish in a very small barrel. I've found myself a Mosin and a long range scope this time out. Though I have no ammo, and I'm not here to shoot anyone, I can at least use the scope as binoculars to scout for trouble ahead. I've been raiding Cernaya Polana, dodging the extremely high population of zombies the town always seems to feature, while listening to the distant booms of Svetlo's constantly exploding gas station. I've also found some nice Gorka camo clothing in the fire station, but no backpack. Just to prove this zombie game does have zombies occasionally. I reach the train tracks and begin following them west, keeping an eye on the recently added and heavily trafficked town of Novodmitrovsk as I run. I hear some distant shots, so I peer through my scope, eventually spotting one player running through Novo's streets. It suddenly occurs to me that aiming a rifle at someone is a good way to get shot (though, clearly, not aiming a rifle at someone is also a good way to get shot) so I put it away. Well, I try to put it away. A million motorcycle helmets. Zero motorcycles. There's occasionally an issue in DayZ, caused by lag, where player actions are delayed for a few seconds. My character won't put away his gun no matter how insistently I tap the key, so I decide to just run away. Once I've started moving, however, I finally see my guy shoulder his Mosin, though he immediately takes it back out again. Since I'm already running, this causes my character to skate forward as if on ice, and I'm unable to stop him. He slides forward about ten feet, off the edge of a rock, falls about six feet to the ground, and promptly dies. Ah yes, the third threat of DayZ: falling a few short feet. It's often fatal. Part five: the lure As if mocking my efforts to fish, the game spawns me north of Svetlojarsk near a small, recently-added fishing village called Dobroe. I loot it, looking longingly at its little pond that would be perfect for fishing, then skirt around Novo to the north, practically off the edge of the map. I'm doing okay: I again have a mountain backpack, a gas canister, and another Mosin (no ammo, though) which I drop when I find another crossbow (still no arrows). I chow down on some apples I find under a tree, I find another hoe to dig up some worms, I find an axe to hack up a new fishing pole with, and I even find a box of 83 matches. I accidentally come down from the hills into the western end of Novo I keep forgetting just how long this city is and cautiously raid few outlying buildings. Apple-Picking Simulator 2014. Outside a store, someone shouts at me to put my hands up. I can just see him inside for a moment before he crouches behind a counter. Then he abruptly pops up, firing three shots at me with a pistol. He misses, somehow, all three times, though my real chest almost explodes from the shock. He then yells at me to leave or he'll kill me (translation: he's out of ammo). When my heart restarts, I head west, spotting another pond near the road that would be perfect for fishing, if only I had the rest of what I needed: at this point, just a rope, and a lure. MinecraftZ. Along the north road I find a pickaxe and chisel some stones from a boulder. You can use eight of these stones to improve a campfire, though I only have enough room to carry two. I eventually come upon the long row of garages again, finding all of them closed. I open the first, find some rope, attach it to my pole, and pause to eat some collected apples and drink some water. When I come back out, I notice something alarming: the rest of the garage doors are now open. Someone else is here, looting the same row from the opposite direction. He's now standing in the garage next to the one I've been having lunch in. Of all the garages in all the world, he had to walk into mine. I peek my head in, wave, and say hello. He has no microphone, and as horrifying as players with mics can be, the silent ones are infinitely worse. Who the hell knows what's going on in their heads? This fellow is typing, though. \"Hello.\" I tell him I'm no threat, I don't have a gun, I'm just looking to do a little fishing, and all I'm missing is a lure. He stares at me a moment, then looks down to the ground at his feet. A moment later, a fishing lure appears on the floor in front of him. \"here take it,\" he types. I edge slowly into the garage where he stands, silent and staring, his Mosin still in his gloved hands. I pick up the lure, thank him profusely (he types \"np\"), ask if he needs anything (\"uhh nah\") wish him a safe adventure, and then I back carefully out of the garage. I hold up one hand and lean side-to-side to make it wave. Then I run like hell. There's no shot, there's no trick, there's no catch. He was just a good guy helping out a fellow lone wolf. Thanks, stranger. Part six: the bite I'm back where I was earlier, in the northwest, thinking again about that pond down near Vybor. This time, though, I give the bus depot and Lopatino a wide berth to the west, further than most players bother to tread. I spot a deer, though in all this time I haven't found a single arrow for my crossbow, and arrows can't yet be crafted. Chasing deer with an axe doesn't really feel like hunting but I do it for a bit anyway, mostly because I'm stalling. Deer-Bothering Simulator 2014. I need to push east toward that pond outside Vybor, but I'm desperately worried about being shot again. Eventually, I creep in, moving from treeline to treeline, scanning for players. I've still not found binoculars so I can't scout properly, and red chains are appearing on my screen every few minutes (an indication of desync, often caused by proximity to other players). Even the fish know better than to pop their heads up in this game. So, I'm thrilled to stumble across a tiny little pond I didn't know was there, north of Pustoshka, surrounded by trees. I'm still close to Vybor, but not as close as I was planning to get. I edge up to the pond, cast my line, and check the bait. I check the bait again. And again. I check the bait about forty times. Nothing. I reposition, cast my line again, and check my bait a couple dozen more times. Finally, a notification: \"There is some movement near the bait.\" Then, \"Something is cautiously examining the bait.\" Something besides me, that is. A notification in red: something has bitten the bait! I pull out the line and find I've caught my first fish, a carp. At this point, the little fish is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in DayZ. This is punishment for eating that innocent worm! As I do on the rare occasions when something good happens to me in DayZ, I run like hell, my heart in my throat. Away from Vybor and Pusto, west into the trees, where I finally stop, take a long look around, and use my axe to chop a tree down. I combine the resulting sticks with a bandage (you can also use paper or rags) to produce a campfire kit, attach a piece of firewood (from the downed tree), and ignite it with my matches. Lighting a fire can be difficult in high winds or rain, but the weather is perfect and it lights on the first try. Time to cook my catch! I add my stones to the fireplace, and use my machete (a hunting knife or kitchen knife also work) to filet my fish, then drop the filets into the fire. Nothing like a crackling fire to put a long day of being murdered behind you. I wait, a long while, but a nice while, a peaceful while, for my fish to go from raw to cooked. All that's missing is one of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s guitars, though that would make music, which would attract players, who would shoot me in the face or axe me in the head. My fish finally cooks, and I pull them from the fire before they go from cooked to burnt (it doesn't take long for that to happen, same as in real life). Chow time! My fish tastes like victory and fish. I have re-invented the fishstick. I'd planned to cover hunting today as well, but you see how even a simple fishing trip can go awry in DayZ. Luckily, there's another form of hunting, where you head to the airfield and look for people wearing clown masks. They don't cook up so well, but on the other hand, you don't need a lot of gear to bag one. ",

It s a documentary series about a guy called Les Stroud who spends a week in the world s most inhospitable places deserts, rainforests, tundras and survives with only the clothes on his back. Fakers like Bear Grylls have doctors on hand, camera crews, and cosy hotels to return to after filming, but Stroud does it all for real and films everything himself. It s really good TV, and I promise that after you watch the first episode you ll be hooked. Anyway, what Survivorman shows us is that nature is terrifying, and doesn t care whether you live or die. These great, lonely expanses, whether it s the dense jungles of the Amazon or the icy plains of Alaska, are cruel, merciless places. Stroud is a seasoned survival expert, and even he struggles to find food or keep warm sometimes. Imagine if you were out there. You wouldn t last a day. So why do survival games always have enemies in them? Zombies, cannibals, wild animals it s completely unnecessary. Nature has already done the hard work and designed the most formidable, intimidating, ruthless villain imaginable: itself. Survival sim developers seem to think they need to include some kind of threat to keep players interested, but that really isn t the case. Being stranded in the middle of nowhere with no food, no fire, and night closing in is scarier than any monster. A survival game doesn t need conflict. There are other ways to keep a player engaged. There could be exploration elements; discovering abandoned camps or ruined buildings, and using them as makeshift shelters. There might be stories to discover, or clues to escaping the wilderness like an old map left behind by a hiker with a route scribbled on it. Or imagine finding something like Christopher McCandless bus, and reading his diary by a flickering campfire. But for this hypothetical game to really work, a lot of love would have to be put into the atmosphere and design of the world. You d need realistic weather and lighting, and stunning natural beauty. That s another thing I love about Survivorman: Stroud is always in awe of the majesty of his surroundings, but also respectful, and occasionally fearful, of them. With a large, diverse, and beautiful environment to explore I d love somewhere like a rainy forest in the Pacific Northwest I d play the game just to wander the landscape and see what I could find before nightfall. But let s say you re an indie developer making your dream realistic survival game, but the guy holding the cheque that ll decide whether the project lives or dies insists on some kind of danger. Well, in that case, you do it subtle. You make animal attacks rare, but possible. As you walk through the forest at night, you might hear a growl, or something stalking you. But it s unlikely it ll ever show itself; until that one, unexpected time when it does, and you have to run for your life. That would be infinitely more compelling than a million shambling zombies. One survival game that almost gets it right is Miasmata. I love the realistic character movement, cartography system, and being able to forage for plants to craft medicines. But then that stupid monster turns up and I lose all interest. The Forest recently added a hidden enemy-free mode (type veganmode on the main menu), but it s clear the game was designed with the cannibal natives in mind, and it feels a bit empty and aimless without them. No developer I know of has been brave enough to design a survival game without any threat. Who ll be the first?",

Let's see how it's doing, and hope it's not one of those awkward meetings where we stand around and make small talk because nothing's really happened. Huh, well, it turns out the game does have some news. Its makers are in the process of moving it to a new engine, and, through that, fix some of the quirks and oddities of the current alpha build. \"I guess the big news that we ve been telling here at E3 is that we re actually moving to a new engine,\" Dean Hall explained during a Reddit AMA. \"It is called . So that is going to allow us to do DirectX 10 and 11. It is going to allow us to do dynamic lighting, which means no more flashlights going through walls, proper dynamic shadows, stuff like that.\" Hold onto your hats, though this isn't as dramatic a shift as it initially sounds. DayZ producer Brian Hicks explains: \"When DayZ started - we took the source from the existing RV Engine - Over the last many months, extensive clean up, new functionality, and so forth has been created for that engine - while at the same time, vast amounts of it were removed, or rewritten entirely. The changes Dean spoke of entail major leaps forward in that work, with those changes and the many more that will come through out development - we have begun to approach the point in which DayZ's engine is so no longer recognizable as RV, and because of that - and the massive work to come, it is now known by its own name, Enfusion.\" \"It is a complete rip out of everything, but we re definitely leveraging existing tech,\" Hall continued. \"So if you look at Bohemia as a studio they actually acquired a great number of other studios, so really were kind of looking around and taking up tech that is available there and mixing it into the engine, rewriting new stuff from scratch that we want to do as well.\" Hall also used the AMA to talk about the upcoming implementation of 64-bit servers, which he says have been successfully tested internally. \"It opens the doors for once we deal with the performance issues we can then triple the number of loot spawns, triple the number of zombies and animals.\" In addition, he confirms the addition of various planned systems, including drugs, alcohol and physics-based barricade creation.

Jimmy Whisenhunt, senior designer on H1Z1, came by the live Twitch stream show at E3 to talk more about the game s goals and SOE s devotion to involving the community in the development process. The big question surrounding H1Z1 is how it will be different from the massively successful mod-turned-standalone project DayZ. It s a survival MMO, Whisenhunt says immediately. It s an MMO in a way that s persistent. It s huge, it s massive. We re starting with 64 square kilometers and we ll be growing from that. We re starting in an area that is kind of middle America, looks kind of Northwesternish with trees and rolling hills. SOE has earned a lot of praise for their open development style, and Whisenhunt reiterated that it is a conscious, deliberate choice. The team checks the H1Z1 subreddit daily, and many feature requests and design decisions are influenced directly from the community. A free-look system, for example, was a widely requested feature, and Whisenhunt just got word that free-look was implemented after he started traveling to Los Angeles for the show. We re on the forgelight engine, and we re leveraging a lot of what we learned on Planetside 2, he says. We have a lot of ability to do whatever we want with vehicles, but right now we re starting with a four-door, four-wheel drive offroader. H1Z1 will also distinguish itself by the behavior and quantity of its titular undead. We re leveraging our world in a new way, he says. We ve shown a little bit of the hoards, and we can support more zombies than a player could kill in his entire life Zombies are attracted to not just sight, but they can smell you. As you move around the world and change what you re doing, you re going to change where the zombies are. We also have livestock, as you can see, and the animals aren t just for food though they are for that. We had an instance down at the booth where you saw a deer come busting out of the wood, and when they re running like that they re spooked. Behind the deer come twenty zombies, and they re chasing the deer. Like Planetside 2 before it, H1Z1 will be a free-to-play game with microtransactions, but Whisenhunt insists that nothing you can buy with real money will have an affect on gameplay. Evan got a chance to spend some time with the game a couple of weeks ago, and you can read his impressions here. As always, catch up on all of our E3 coverage by visiting this page.",

But with the recent expansion of its development team, the DayZ designers at Bohemia Interactive are now laying out a plan for a better-behaved zombie antagonist, according to a new post on the game's official dev blog. Zombies in the current early-access version of the Standalone look sufficiently decayed and are aggressively persistent in their bloodlust. But they also occasionally walk through walls and ignore solid objects. It's the kind of problem the developer is looking to solve now that the design team has nearly doubled in size in recent months. \"Our major focus has been on establishing the architecture, both in the team and in the game, in order to deliver best in the future,\" the developer reports. \"This involved us drastically increasing the size of the team working on the game. This had a severe short-term impact on our progress as our existing team had to devote time and resources to training and planning. The new zombie pathfinding is a good example of this approach beginning to produce results.\" One promising solution to zombie pathfinding uses an approach called \"navigation mesh,\" a technique that the developer believes will give it the results it wants but also balances the performance requirements of DayZ's massive game world. The new method abandons an older approach which had two different systems governing zombie behavior one for building interiors and one for outside. You can check out some screenshots illustrating the new navmesh approach here. \"Because the system is now unified it means that more efficient (and more natural) pathfinding solutions are available to the AI, at a fraction of the performance cost as before,\" according to the developer. The changes to zombie AI are still upcoming, but be sure to check out the complete post for more info on other features and changes planned for the DayZ Standalone, including animal design, fishing, and fireplace building.",

Unfortunately for Bohemia Interactive, they don't live in that after-world, only simulate it. And while DayZ is a game that's hosted more than it's fair share of jerks, normally it's at least in the spirit of anything-goes survival. Not this time, though: Bohemia have confirmed that their servers were attacked by hackers. The good news is that players, and the game's development, are apparently unaffected. Bohemia confirmed the attack in a statement made to RPS: \"We have recently detected an attack on some of our servers, the precise nature and scope of this attack is currently being extensively investigated. There were no user data on any of the servers. Current development goals and schedules for our games will not be affected by this attack. \"More information will follow as our investigation continues.\" What Bohemia haven't confirmed is whether the source code was stolen. That's the suggestion made in this Reddit thread, which captures forum posters sharing pictures that they claim are of the game's code. If that's the case, it opens the door for a potential flood of cheats and hacks to be introduced to the game. That could also explain the reason for the attack. As our recent feature uncovered, cheats are a multi-million dollar business.",

With millions of players buying into the early-access, standalone alpha of the zombie survival sim, it's safe to say a DayZ flash mob group was bound to surface. Founded back in February, the Steam group has been releasing videos of its meetups in recent days. You can check out one example below. A lighthearted subversion of the game's more typical kill-or-be-killed experience of wandering and looting, the video is one of several uploaded by the flash mob group. While I'd more likely be the guy sitting in the corner desperately trying to open a cold can of beans, there's a certain joyful goofiness to the flash mob that makes me smile. Other events captured by the group include a rap battle and a not-so-serious attempt to test the limits of DayZ's simulated gravity. For a comment thread collecting the flash mob group's ideas, go here. Also be sure to check out our excellent recent series on life in the DayZ alpha, DayZ Diaries. Thanks, Kotaku UK.",

That may explain why more than 2 million people have chosen to take the game's warning in their stride since the survival FPS launched into Early Access last December, as revealed by developer Dean 'Rocket' Hall last night. Just over 2 years ago the DayZ mod released. Today, the Standalone game just broke 2 million units in under 6 months https://t.co/o4WjnTs8Bi&mdash; Dean Hall (@rocket2guns) May 1, 2014 Technically, it's been four and a half months. Or 137 days. In fact, if you really want to wallow in some minutia, the game has sold the equivalent of approximately 10.1 copies every minute since launch. Thanks, maths! It's not hard to see why it's proved so popular. You just need to look at the stories it can generate.

More importantly, it removes some significant features. So, as we welcome a new village, a recipe for bow crafting and the ability to melee attack with a frying pan, we also bid good riddance to mouse acceleration (or, to go by its scientific name, \"weird floaty mouse times\"). \"Two very important changes were improvements to multiplayer netcode and an entirely new mouse control system that removed the previous one based on mouse acceleration,\" writes Rocket in the latest DayZ update. The new 1:1 mouse movement should hopefully make DayZ a smoother, and more responsive first-person shooter. That post also details the DayZ team's upcoming focus, much of which is in pursuit of greater optimisation in the future. 64-bit servers are being tested, solving memory-limit issues; the renderer is being disconnected from simulation, leading towards client-side FPS improvements; and loot respawn experiments are going ahead, in the hope of a globally managed loot solution. As for other upcoming changes, Rocket is teasing a new city that the team are working on. \"This city, called Novodmitrovsk, will have an industrial zone and is very close in size to Cherno or Electro but located in the north of our terrain.\" You can see the full patch notes for 0.44.123800 below: Known Issues: Binoculars not functioning properly in crouch and prone states.

It looks like the DayZ Standalone will be getting a few new helping hands. Creator Dean \"Rocket\" Hall has announced the purchase of Slovakian game developer Cauldron by Bohemia Interactive, with 25 of that studio's staff set to work on the zombie survival sim, according to a report at Eurogamer. Hall announced the purchase during an appearance at EGX Rezzed 2014, where he also revealed the DayZ SA alpha had sold more than 1.7 million copies since its December launch. Cauldron is to be re-named Bohemia Interactive Slovakia, according to the Eurogamer story. The Bratislava-based studio has worked on a range of different titles over the years, including several in the Cabela's hunting series. The studio purchase is likely what Hall was referring to when he wrote in a blog update a month ago that the development team was \"effectively doubling.\" Other details revealed in Hall's presentation include some new in-game items and mechanics planned for the next update to the alpha. These include upgradable fireplaces and a crossbow which should be introduced when the update goes live sometime in April. The loot spawning system will also see some changes after the update, with doors resetting and gear reappearing in different areas of the game map at different times. Even in its alpha state, DayZ still offers one of the most unique gaming experiences around. To get more people on the project, plus designers who have some experience recreating the great outdoors in gaming, sounds like a welcome development for the game's future. For a refresher on what DayZ is all about, be sure to check out the excellent DayZ Diaries. &nbsp;",

One example, the fireplace seen above, is mostly there to accommodate the cooking system, which will allow you to cook certain items, or create new ones, like soup. Sounds delicious, or at least a lot better than being forced fed a rotten banana. Good thing DayZ already balanced players stomach capacity. The update may be a while, however. We are committed to not releasing builds onto stable to introduce new game breaking bugs. Hall says. Now that we ve fixed those bugs, we re internally verifying and fixing any new bugs that have been introduced. We will do an unscheduled update the moment we are confident we have a suitable build to release. The update, whenever it decides to sneak up on us, is also adding new towns, which are teased in these images: New weapons, including a lovingly crafted AKM, are also in the works. As for the bow and arrow and throwing items, Hall says that progress on the physics engine means they re now functional at a basic level. Earlier this month, we learned that the DayZ development team doubled in size. Hall s post reveals that at least some of these new members are working at different locations in Bratislava, and that they are working on animals, collisions, and zombie pathfinding. If you re a DayZ fanatic, there are more details to mull over at the game s developer blog.",

His latest Weekly Report brings the news that DayZ's development team has been pretty much doubled, along with details of a new cooking system \"heavily inspired by the outstanding \" in Project Zomboid. Hey, zombie survival games need to stick together - it's a grim world out there. Details after the break. Cooking in DayZ, unlike in the real world, will be a relatively simple process. Step one: switch your cooking implement, ie stove or fireplace, on. Step two: place food item in said cooking implement and wait a bit. Your food will either achieve 'cooked' status or be transformed into a new, related item (for example soup). Leave things heating up for too long and they can become overcooked, or eventually go cold. I haven't played Zomboid beyond the demo, but Hall's description reminds me of the cooking system in Monster Hunter, albeit (probably) without the catchy jingle and jaunty haunch-rotation animation. You'll be able to discern the temperature of cooking implements and food by their redosity, which is a word that's totally in the dictionary and you don't even need to look. The image above helpfully explains that \"more red = hotter\", which in general is a good rule for real-world cooking too. Food preperation will arrive as \"part of a wider push in March to focus on Survival aspects of the game in general\", although no date was given in the post. Food aside, Hall provides an update on the Standalone's animation system: two-handed melee animations and \"stab attack with hay fork\" are on their way soon, together with a new reload animation for the Ruger MKII. Also: bug fixes, which are always appreciated. (Cheers, Gamespot.)",

As the early access survival game progresses over the next few months, post-apocalyptic survivors will find themselves helped (and hindered) by adjusted lighting, lootable fridges, increased zombies, and - most terrifyingly of all - a physics system. Through the implementation of a middle-ware physics engine, players will be able to throw items and ragdoll about. I look forward to seeing how the game's community will warp these systems in the name of trolling and torment. For lighting, torches will emit a proper light source, so that the beam will also exist during the day. The plan is that, by doing so, night-time play will also be more viable. As for containers, they're becoming full inventories, offering players the possibility of more loot in places where, contextually, it would make sense. Also planned are bows and arrows, new buildings, hunting and cooking, and improved zombies. The team want to not just add more zombies, but also fix the existing issues, like their current ability to phase through walls. In addition, fixing server desync and improving stability remain primary targets, with the latter key to allowing persistent objects that aren't wiped during a server respawn. For a full list of planned improvements, head over to the DayZ development blog. Alternatively, you can absorb its information through the audio-visual update below. ",

Talking to Eurogamer, Hall explained his desire to leave Bohemia Interactive by the end of the year, to set up a new studio in New Zealand. \"I have a specific use, Hall said. \"I'm really good at risk-taking and making other people take risks, I've always been good at that in my life. Like you say, maybe I've got the gift of the gab, so I can talk, I can explain something, I can talk people up to the ledge and get them to jump off it. \"Eventually, that's the bad person to have. Eventually, you don't want the guy telling you to go over the top and get through. So at some point I'll be a disaster for the project, at least in a leadership role.\" Hall explained that he wasn't originally intending to be around for 2014, but claimed \"it would be stupid not to, and it would be unfair to the community.\" On that note, he said that he would remain with the project as long as he was needed, either as leader or in a more creative role. \"I'll always be involved,\" he stated. Later in the interview, Hall reveals that he has a number of other multiplayer games he'd like to work on, saying that sees DayZ as a \"fundamentally flawed\" concept. \"It's not the perfect game,\" he said, \"it's not the multiplayer experience, and it never can be, the absolute spark that I want in it.\" Of course, DayZ itself will continue to be developed, and, for all his recognition of its faults, it sounds like Hall is committed to leaving the project in good hands. This isn't an out of the blue decision. Last month, Hall told Edge that, \"for me there ll be a time when my full-on involvement is finished, and I think a lot of the fans will agree with that. \"It s dangerous, because I like to push for a lot of things that could become bad for the project. Development will need to transition through to someone who can maintain that, and can open it up to the community.\" It seems that stepping back from the frontline of DayZ is something that Hall's been contemplating for a while, and sounds like he sees the eventual move as a decision that's not just beneficial to himself, but also to DayZ.",

This week, Andy looks to the future of DayZ. I ve logged 98 hours in the DayZ alpha since it was released in December, and I think I ve finally bled it dry. When I start a new life I have a routine. I hit the nearest town to my spawn point, scavenge as much food and drink as I can, then head inland. Here I pick the towns that everyone ignores clean until I have a backpack, a fire axe, and maybe a weapon if I m lucky. Then I ll hit an airfield or military base and, providing I survive, pick up a tactical vest, ammo, weapon attachments, and other military gear. I m so familiar with the map now that I can do this in as little as an hour. Then I reach the point that every geared player in DayZ has experienced at least once: what do I do now? This is a common question on Reddit and the DayZ forums, and the responses are always the same. Use your imagination. Get into adventures. Meet people. I agree, because this is a true sandbox game in which you have to set your own objectives, but the hurdle here is other people. Whenever I head to the coast after gearing up to help bambis or interact with other players, I m usually attacked or killed on sight before anything interesting happens. It s difficult to use your imagination when trigger happy bandits have none of their own. Stories seem increasingly hard to come by in Chernarus these days. But it s an alpha, and far from content complete. It s incredible that I ve managed to squeeze almost a hundred hours out of something that s barely finished and incredibly broken. Bohemia have big ideas about the future of the game, including hunting, player-made structures, underground bases, and even laboratories for researching a cure for the virus. Yes, really. You can read about all of this, and more, in our latest issue. Some of this probably won t make it into the game, but whatever does is all leading to one important goal: giving DayZ a legitimate endgame. Then players will have something to strive for other than finding an M4 as quickly as possible and shooting new spawns with it. When I think about DayZ s future, I imagine groups of players working together and establishing Mad Max-style shanty towns in the wilderness. Bandits will attack in vehicles they ve salvaged, and the inhabitants will have to take up arms and defend their homes. Hunters will leave the safety of the town on horseback with bows and rifles to hunt deer, but could be ambushed by hungry bandits and never return. Communities could form alliances with their neighbours, or even go to war with them over limited resources. What we see in DayZ now is only a fragment of its potential. I d also like to see more story elements in the world. The Green Mountain radio transmissions in the mod were an enticing glimpse at the events behind the fall of Chernarus. Narrative should never be at the forefront of DayZ, but I d like to see subtle details in the environment, and maybe things like audio logs and notes, that add a little more colour and detail to the setting. The crashed plane in Chernogorsk and moored cargo ship on the eastern coast are a step in the right direction, because you feel yourself making up your own tales about what could have happened to them. Chernarus is already a rich, atmospheric setting, but I want to know more about its past, and what caused the outbreak. Of course, for now, this is all just a distant dream. Similar ideas are no doubt scribbled on notepads and whiteboards all over Bohemia s offices. I m confident they ll take the game in the right direction, even when Dean Rocket Hall eventually departs. He said in a recent Edge interview that there ll be a time when he moves on to do other things, but that development of DayZ will continue without him. The Early Access release has been an incredible success, with 1.5 million survivors to date, so it ll be around for a long time, mutating and evolving with each update. For now, though, I feel like I m close to reaching the limits of what DayZ has to offer, at least in its current form.

Since the most recent update, a dark cloud of gloom has descended upon Chernarus. Most servers I join are now lashed with rain, and it s completely transformed the atmosphere of the game. The ominous grey skies, pounding rain, and booming thunder are much more post-apocalyptic than those cloudless, sunny days. Everything is just so damn cinematic now, whether I m in a standoff at an airfield or looting a deserted town. Are you French? I m a few miles north of Kamyshovo, and two players in military gear and clown masks have approached me. I m wearing basic civilian clothes, but the hunting backpack and modded M4 rifle on my back betray the fact that I m geared up. No. I respond, putting my hands up. By now I ve accepted the fact that I m going to die, because only two types of people wear the Payday masks these days: new players who don t know any better, and jerks. These guys, as it turns out, are the latter. Where are you from? they ask. UK. I respond, wondering briefly whether I should have lied and put on a French accent. But before I can channel Allo Allo!, they shoot me in the head. It s the worst kind of DayZ death: cruel, pointless, and at the hands of dickish bandits with no imaginations. At least handcuff me and force-feed me disinfectant or something. Jesus. As thunder rumbles in the distance, I hear them picking through my meticulously organised inventory. The next time I play, it s a much more pleasant experience. A friend and I, wearing matching cowboy hats, go on a loot run through the midsection of the map, hitting Green Mountain, Stary Sobor, a few small towns, and a military base on the way. I have an SKS with a decent amount of ammo, and Tobias has a pistol with a single round chambered in it, so we decide we might as well head to the north-west airfield: a famously dangerous PVP hotspot where quality military-grade loot spawns if the server hoppers haven t gotten to it first. We skirt around the edge of the airfield s huge concrete runways, sticking to the trees, scouting for other players who might have had the same idea as us. Then I spot what looks like a player on the opposite side of the runway, lying prone on a grassy verge. It s a sniper! I call out to Tobias. We move carefully through the treeline, keeping our eyes on the player, until we manage to flank him and discover that it s a tree stump. The tension and paranoia I experience while playing DayZ regularly plays tricks on my mind like this. One time I thought a bush in the distance was a player aiming a rifle at me and put my hands up. We make our way up to the hangars. The airfield looks clear, so we head towards the fire station, when suddenly I see another player. A real one this time. We watch him for a while, but he seems to disappear. So, foolishly, we push on, looting the station, barracks, and AT tower. I m at the top of the tower, when I hear the telltale crack of a Mosin round. Someone s shooting at me! says Tobias, who I see running along the runway with an armed player behind him. I panic and empty all six rounds from my Magnum in his general direction, but none of them hit. I fumble for my SKS, aim through the iron sights, only to see him aiming his rifle at me. I manage to get off the first shot and he falls to the ground. My heart is racing. Tobias and I express our relief over voice chat, amazed we survived. When you go somewhere like the north-west airfield you accept the fact that someone is going to shoot at you, and you re probably going to die, so it s always a pleasant surprise when it doesn t happen. As we loot the body hey, he fired at us first, so it s allowed we see another player lying prone, rolling towards us. We pull our guns and aim them at him. Woah, what are you doing, buddy? Tobias asks. The man responds in Russian, but knows enough English to tell us he s broken his legs and that he wants us to kill him. I oblige and unload an SKS round into his head. A dark moment, but one made even darker by the rain and thunder echoing around us.

        "contents": "Earlier this week we identified the source of a \"respawn\" bug that would cause players to become stuck in the \"you are dead\" screen. Because of the extent of the problem, and the difficulty it causes players, we have decided to push the 0.34 update to stable very early. What was the bug? This was caused when two small bugs with existing systems combined together when another bug was fixed. When a player clicked \"respawn\" for an unconscious character, the game server immediately sends an urgent message to the database asking it to kill the players current character. The the server sets the players game character's damage to full, and proceeds to save the characters current inventory/position one last time to the database. Normally, by the time it has finished that the damage has been set for the character and, again, a message was sent to the server demanding the player was killed. There was an old failsafe in the \"save character\" system on the central server, that when asked to save a character where no alive one existed, it would make a new one. What this meant was, the respawned character would be killed, then saved new, then killed again. The problem occurs that when a server comes under heavy load... both kill messages occur first. This means that a cloned, already dead, character then exists - trapping the player in a cycle of death. This complex logic state issue was identified and fixed yesterday. What does this mean? This means three things: The 0.34 will not be as extensive as we wanted it to be (just hotfixing) There is increased risk of new bugs creeping in to stable as 0.34 has not been tested long Today the whole stable network will be dropped to deploy the update Why not wait until the scheduled update? We feel that the impact of the bug is too high, and affecting too many players, to wait until we have tested the update more extensively and deploy it during our scheduled maintenance periods (wednesdays). Leading into the weekend, there is the potential for the problem to become worse as the server performance drops as more and more character have the issue and connect/disconnect trying to fix it. When will this happen? 7 February 12PM GMT, the stable branch network will be taken down to deploy the update. Please note: it can take game server providers up to 30 minutes to drop their servers. Players who are connected to a game server while the central server drops, are at risk of losing their progress. How long will the downtime last? We expect it stable to be down for three hours. Will Experimental Branch go down too? No, Experimental Branch will not be affected, although only a small number of servers run this branch.",

The update brings some minor features and bug fixes, but the most important change is the continued improvement of server performance. Thanks to \"a significant change to the server variable processing,\" the game's servers should have received a major performance boost. According to the patch notes, this should result in a smoother game experience and, more significantly, is another step towards the goal of increased player and zombie numbers, as well as the enabling of loot and zombie respawning. In terms of features, crafting has received some extra usability tweaks, with combat knives and machetes able to open canned food. Also, the game has machetes now. That's not a terrifying thought in the slightest. Elsewhere, military zombies have been made tougher, weapons have been rebalanced, animations have been tweaked, and new gestures have been added. Players are now able to both clap and point. I dread to think of how those two simple interactions will be twisted into something sinister. You'll find the full patch notes below. For a rundown of DayZ's confirmed upcoming features, head to Dean Hall's community post from last year, where he lists some of the work still to be done.

Last week I decided that, if I'm ever playing DayZ alone and I run into another player, I'll kill them on sight. Harsh, yes, but the only way to make sure I don't get punched in the head by a fresh spawn with nothing to lose. So there I am, running down the coast towards Kamyshovo, when I spot a survivor up ahead. Not taking any chances, I drop to my knees and shoot him with my Mosin. The way I see it, a bambi is just a bandit who hasn't found a gun yet. Then I hear a thud. I turn around and there's an unarmed player in a t-shirt swinging his fists at me. Either he just spawned or he snuck up on me while I was busy with the other guy. I pull out my Magnum and fire at him, but he's moving too fast. One bullet grazes him and he starts to bleed, but the other five miss completely. Never fire from the hip. \"Nice shot, homie.\" my assailant mocks, running in circles around me. \"Ooh, so close!\" I try to equip my axe, but the animation freezes my character in place and a fist connects with my head while I'm vulnerable. I'm knocked unconscious and I hear my gear being looted. Maybe I deserved that. Not just karmically, but because I was sprinting around in the open like an idiot, rather than sticking sensibly to the treeline. The biggest mistake you can make in DayZ when you have a gun is feeling invincible and letting your guard down. So I spawn back at the beach once again - this time near Berezino - and start looting. After a careful hour of sneaking from house to house I have a backpack, an axe, and a nice haul of food and drink. I decide to head north to the wrecked cargo ship, then to the town of Svetlojarsk. I'm on the outskirts of Berezino, near the lumber mill, when I hear the ping of a ricocheting bullet. Someone's shooting at me, but I don't know where from. I take a hit and start bleeding, but I manage to escape into a row of backyards before they can finish me off. Through an alley I see the gunman and his buddy on the main road. They're decked out in military gear and fully armed. \"I think I got him.\" one of them says over voice chat. \"Yeah, you did,\" I respond, knowing I'm safely hidden behind a wall. \"But you're a terrible shot. Asshole.\" Realising that I'm foolishly mocking a man who's carrying a big gun, I make a run for it. After a few minutes of nervously checking behind me I'm certain they haven't given chase. I can see the cargo ship in the distance perched on the edge of the eastern shore, so I keep pushing on. Then I spot another player on the road directly in front of me carrying a shotgun. I consider running away, but decide that it's probably smarter to let them know I'm not a threat. I approach, expecting a face full of buckshot. Instead, I get a cheery hello. \"Do you need any assistance?\" the stranger asks. It's finally happened: I've met the only friendly armed player in DayZ. \"No, I'm fine,\" I say, giving a wave. \"Thanks!\" We silently part ways and he continues towards Berezino. \"Wait!\" I call to him. \"There are two guys up ahead with guns. They shot at me, but I survived. Be careful.\" \"Oh, thanks. You too.\" Did I just save his life? It's entirely possible, and now I'm having a crisis of conscience. If I had a Mosin I would have shot him the instant I saw him in the distance. I would have murdered the nicest man in Chernarus in cold blood. I feel like the bad guy in the movie who has a moral awakening and turns good. I swear, from this day forth, I will never shoot on sight again. Andy is documenting his every death in DayZ on dayzdeathdiary.tumblr.com, and recently devoted the latest entry in his Other Places video series to Chernarus. Here it is, rendered in the slightly plushier Arma 3 engine. ",

The team are patching on two fronts, adding long-planned features and coming up with adaptive fixes to alter the way alpha players are currently exploiting the game. It means that as well as machetes and better sawed-off shotguns, there will soon be time penalties for swapping servers too quickly. That ought to deter players who hop onto an empty server to raid the loot-heavy airfield, and then hop back to a populated server to use their gear on hapless bambis. That sort of thing makes our resident DayZ fan, Andy, very angry indeed. He may take solace from the fact we'll soon be able to paint our crash helmets different colours, point, and clap, though the full hokey-cokey emote is sadly yet to materialise. Full notes below. For more on DayZ check out Andy's weekly adventures. As mentioned in the notes below, the final version of the patch is planned for release as early as Wednesday next week. DAYZ PENDING UPDATE CHANGELOG Branch: Experimental ETA to Stable: 5-7 February 2014 Version: 0.33.114782 Known Issues: - Spawns: Loot is not spawning in military tents - Spawns: Some structures in Svetlo currently do not spawn loot - Server: Servers under load can delay actions from the client - Only 4 dynamic light sources will be rendered at one time currently What are experimental/stable branches? In your steam application settings, you can choose a \"beta branch\". This allows you to opt in to our experimental branch to try it out. Does my saved character get affected in experimental branch? No. It runs on a different database, so any changes will not affect your character on stable branch. I can't find a slot while on experimental branch! Only a small number of servers run this branch. You will need to change your game back to the stable branch and play on a normal server Can I join a stable branch server wil experimental branch client? No, you would need to change your client back to stable. When will this be in stable? We expect stable to be updated before the end of that week (by 7 February 2014). Why has &lt;insert any bug&gt; not been fixed yet when there is new content coming in? While priorities are very important when assigning work, there is a limit to how many people can work on a complex task without making it even more complex. Also, many of the team are focused purely on content/design so while the important stuff is being fixed, they continue to provide content and design updates. Is mouse acceleration being fixed? It is not fixed in this update, but we plan to make control changes. It is not as simple as turning it \"off\" as the speed your character turns is not dictated by the mouse itself, but your movements combined with the type of weapon you have, how tired you are, etc. New: - Actions: chambering SKS round from pile, loading 10 rounds from pile - Actions: You can uncuff other players with the hacksaw - Actions: Cannot use an item (e.g. drink/eat) if it is \"Ruined\" - Actions: Interactions with items reworked.

Hi there! one of us announces. The pair turn to look at us. Are you guys thirsty? Hungry? we ask. They say nothing, merely looking at us, a group of about four.

In last week's diary I spoke with some relish about my first foray into the thrilling world of cold-hearted banditry. But then the update happened and my character was reset. So here I am, back on the beach in a t-shirt, thirsty, unarmed, and helpless. But I don't mind, because some of the best stories in DayZ emerge when you're at the bottom of the food chain. I'm in Berezino. The town has already been emptied and all I manage to scavenge is an axe, a backpack, and a few cans of beans. As I'm looting the supermarket, I run into another player. He's a fresh spawn too and sounds friendly enough over voice chat. \"Do you want to go to the north-east airfield and get some better loot?\" he asks. I agree, and we head inland. We make small talk on the way, exchanging names. I don't have a compass, but it feels like we're going in the right direction. We poke our heads in a few buildings along the way, but they've been picked clean too. The server is full, so I'm not surprised. We hike for about five minutes until we hit a dirt road, when a figure suddenly emerges from a bush. \"Put your hands up.\" I comply. I don't have much choice with an M4 pointed at my head. The bandit handcuffs me and orders me to drop to my knees. I'm wondering why he isn't bothering with my new friend, who's been lying prone this whole time. Then I realise what's happening. They're working together. \"That'll teach you to trust people!\" the betrayer laughs, stealing my axe and backpack. I'm angry, but also impressed. I'm angpressed. They uncuff me, but rather than suffer the indignity of trekking back to Berezino in my underpants, I ask them to kill me. My former friend refuses, saying they're 'nice bandits', but his friend approaches, silently loads his pistol, and pulls the trigger. Now I understand why so many people kill on sight in DayZ, even when confronted by a seemingly harmless bambi. There are more back-stabbing bastards in Chernarus than Westeros and Deadwood combined. My pride is hurt, and I'm more paranoid than ever, but I'm still not willing to kill on sight. Interacting with other survivors is half the fun of DayZ for me. I start a new character, and after a successful raid on the north-west airfield with a friend, I'm geared up again. I have a Mosin, a long range scope, a case of ammo, and one of those neat-looking military berets added in the update. My friend logs off, so I go for a wander along the south coast. As I'm running along the highway connecting Solnichny and Kamyshovo, I end up with three fresh spawns tailing me. They ask to tag along and I agree, not for a second considering them a threat. I have a gun after all. We run into a zombie and I take it down with my axe, but it gets a hit in before it falls. \"Dude, you've been hit!\" says one of the bambis. \"You better bandage up!\" Foolishly, I do, and as I'm locked in the animation, he starts punching me in the head. I pull out my axe. \"Sorry! I just wanted your loot!\" I swing at him, but he's running in circles, still punching. Then another bambi joins in. In the confusion I kill all three of them, including the one who wasn't attacking me. \"Nice try, idiot.\" I curse over voice chat. I'm still bleeding, and the colour is draining from my screen. I bandage up and continue heading west, this time with my rifle loaded and primed. As Roger Daltrey once sang, I won't get fooled again. This is the turning point for me. After 75 hours of Dayz - of near-constant treachery, deception, and duplicitous dickery - I've decided that enough is enough. From now on, when I'm playing solo, I'm killing anyone I see. Even if you're a bambi in a t-shirt, you're going down without hesitation. Chernarus has ruined me. I'm Christopher Walken at the end of The Deer Hunter: a dazed, dead-eyed shadow of my former self, numbed by the horrors I've seen. Andy is keeping track of his every bitter demise in DayZ, you can follow those at DayZdeathdiary.tumblr.com.",

Those bandits maybe <em>won&#8217;t</em> fix them, and this post-Soviet state will suddenly start to look very pre-Soviet indeed. Though this natural outcome seems unlikely for a mere computer game, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s so exciting about DayZ being Early Access. We get to watch its apocalypse unfold. This must be a rather strange prospect for Ivan Buchta, the Bohemia Interactive designer who grew up in the northern area of the Czech Republic the map so closely resembles. To the current DayZ Standalone team he&#8217;s the &#8220;Ambassador Of The Republic Of Chernarus&#8221;, which makes plotting the death of his birthplace an unlikely part of his job description. But then that&#8217;s the other thing about DayZ going Early Access: it&#8217;s a job he seems to share with just about everyone, from his workmates to the players who think they should ratify the game&#8217;s every move. <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/22/an-unexpected-journey-the-life-and-dead-of-dayzs-chernarus/#more-185835\" class=\"more-link\">(more&hellip;)</a> ",

Most important is that Hall thinks that DayZ will be playable, meaning more stable and with more features like cars, base building, and more weapons, in about six months. As it is, he thinks DayZ is about 20 percent finished. Here are the most interesting things he had to say. About greater goals in the game, fortifying structures, clearing mines, running a power station: \"Yes, this kind of endgame stuff is quite key to what we want to do. However, in order to do this we have to perfect the architecture which is what we are doing now. Certainly I think underground bases and advanced vehicles will allow some of this really exciting and 'Eve' style play.\" About improvements to voice functionality: \"Well kind of everything. The quality. Allowing more types (whisper etc...). How zombies react to it. And also particularly the animation and how it plays when your character opens his mouth to speak.\" About improving the engine (which relies heavily on the CPU) to use more of the GPU: \"Yes. It is easier for us to optimize DayZ in some ways, because DayZ's focus is very narrow. ArmA is an incredible game and ArmA 3 is no exception. It has massive scope and a huge demand on AI and many other things. Many of these things can cause problems for MP gaming, and that's what I'm all about really. We have reports from Intel, AMD/ATI, and Nvidia. These give us ideas for how to optimize the client. Let's just say there is huge room for improvement.\" About adding different kinds of shelters: \"We have a plan for camping. Playing that mod for Skyrim (survival mod, forget its name) is GREAT inspiration and I hope we can do everything it has.\" (Frostfall is the mod in question.) About whether the game will have aircrafts: \"Yes. I think helicopters and small aircraft will be important. But they should be very complex to maintain.\" About additional content after release: \"Yes. There will be content updates and such for DayZ for a long time, I believe. However that would be up to Bohemia for the most part. I'm not sure I would (not want to) be super involved with that.\" About when we ll see vehicles and bases: \"Vehicles will be done based on the architecture we are doing for items/weapons now (i.e. attachments). So it's in progress really. We are replacing the physics system for items (throwing, etc...) and this new middleware will be used for vehicles also. Bases will take longer. Barricades will happen first.\" About Rust: \"I have tried rust. I think it's great. I think Garry is fing talented, deserves all the success he has/is getting. Overall I'm just really proud that something I did inspired a great designer like Garry to do something else.\" About when Bohemia decided to make DayZ standalone: \"I was already working ArmA 3 as a multiplayer designer. I got invited to meet Marek Spanel (CEO) at his house to discuss DayZ when we had about 20,000 players.\" A polite but cryptic answer to how much money he makes from DayZ: \"Saying specifics can be tough, I think (but I'm not really sure why, it just seems like it's rude to say how much you earn or bragging or something). But I get a royalty, and I get paid. I also sold (assigned) the rights for DayZ to Bohemia so I was remunerated there too. Compared to royalty rates for other 'artists' and such I am probably doing very well. Compared to game designers (who mostly don't get royalties) I'm doing extremely well. My royalty rate is not insignificant (it is fairly significant).\" About features he would like to implement but can t with the current technology: Procedural terrain, limitless environment. I don't think its impossible with current technology but I don't think it's possible within the scope of the project.\" About Early Access: \"I think it's great but there are massive icebergs sitting around it waiting to be hit. I think some projects are going to hit those and those issues will need to be addressed. It helps because it gets rid of the publishers dictating what the people find popular. You guys say what concepts are good, not some fat guys driving bugattis.\" On games he wants to develop in the future: \"I really have a focus on multiplayer games, that allow the player to choose the groups they form organically with the freedom to do most things. I like games that have a persistent ongoing nature. These are the games I mostly want to focus on. Can't really offer to many more hints because I don't want someone else to make it before I can start!\" And about JayZ: \"Jay-Z's lawyers tried to get us to stop using DayZ and change it to ZDay, actually. We declined. But it did make me laugh.\" All of the obvious questions have been answered, but Hall is still replying to users at the moment. You can find the full thread and get your questions in here.",

There you are, minding your own business, merrily looting a building, when some invisible bastard kills you with a Mosin. I ve always cursed those players, but last night I became one. I m scouting the Balota airstrip with a friend, Tobias. We ve just cautiously looted the military tents to the south, and the area seems clear of players. I have an M4 with a pristine ACOG, he has a Mosin with a pristine long range scope. Next stop, the hangars. We creep through the treeline, taking it slow. Then, directly across from us, we spot two players in full military gear sprinting past the AT tower. They look armed, so we go prone in the grass and watch them for a while. They loot the hangars, kill a couple of zombies, then head towards the barracks. This is when we decide to make our move. We sneak up the airstrip until we re parallel with the barracks. Tobias aims his scope at the door from the treeline and I push forward, hoping our oblivious targets are still busy looting. Crossing the runway leaves me exposed, but halfway across there s a patch of grass. I m wearing green, so I go prone and train my ACOG on the entrance. My heart is racing. Suddenly, one of the players appears at the door. I fire a burst from my M4 and he falls to the ground. He s dead, but his partner understandably panics and runs back into the barracks. With Tobias still providing cover with his Mosin, I stand up and sprint towards the building. I circle it slowly, looking through the windows, but there s no sign of him. I have to go in. I enter the barracks and inch forward. As I turn the corner towards the stairs, I see the player at the top of them. He has his M4 pointed at me and fires a few rounds. Miraculously, none of them hit me. I leave the building and sprint around the back. If he follows me Tobias will get him, but he doesn t. About five minutes pass without any signs of movement. Maybe he logged out? Then, just as we re beginning to let our guard down, he makes a run for it. He s moving too fast for Tobias to take the shot, but I appear from behind the barracks, fire my M4 from the hip, and take him down. I ve played the game for 60 hours now, and this is the first time I ve not only survived a firefight, but come out on top. I am the invisible bastard. Looting the bodies, we realise that our victims had modded M4s and enough ammo to supply a small guerrilla army. We help ourselves to their supplies and scurry back into the trees. The adrenaline rush and preceding tension of our attack is one of the most exhilarating experiences I ve had in DayZ so far, even though I probably just ruined someone s evening. I ll never become the asshole bandit who hunts fresh spawns on the coast for sport, but this encounter has given me a taste for PVP that I ve never had before. Usually I avoid trouble and stick to the trees, but now I have a thirst for blood and beans. I do feel a little bad about killing those guys, but they would have done the same to us if they had the chance right?",

Betrayal! Vomit! Our DayZ stream had it all. For over three hours yesterday afternoon, the PC Gamer UK team journeyed across Chernarus. Along the way, we met friends, fought foes, and even encountered a couple of the game's developers. We were also hunted mercilessly, as viewers of the stream triangulated our position and set out on their own adventure to take us down. If you couldn't join us live, you can catch up with the full broadcast thanks to the VODs embedded below. Part 1, Andy's PoV: Hiking Simulator 2014 Part 2, Tom's PoV: The Hungry Games Part 3, Phil's PoV: #KillBen2014 Part 4, Chris's PoV: The Final Ascent If you were there, thanks for joining us. As you can probably tell from the stream, we were genuinely surprised by how well it went, and came out of the experience with a great story to tell. Stream sniping can be a major problem - but here it was a welcome threat. In a game based on anonymity and the unknown, having a clear and present danger provided an amazing context for our journey to Green Mountain. It was a pleasure to be murdered by you all.",

Today, the PC Gamer team is taking a break from fighting words, to instead fight some zombies, bandits, and those oh-so-deadly ladders. We're playing DayZ today from 2pm until... well, until we die. It could be a short stream. Hopefully it won't be. You can track our progress, as we weave between towns, cities and military bases, by heading over to our Twitch channel, or just watching below.

We ve been running down the coast for what feels like hours, and we re all dying of thirst and/or hunger. Then, up ahead on the main road, we see another player. We all point our guns at the stranger, even though we don t have any ammo, but he waves and says he s friendly. Amazingly, it s Chris. By sheer chance, I ve bumped into someone I know in the vast expanse of Chernarus. He s in dire need of food and water too, so we decide to hike west towards the city of Elektrozavodsk to try and find life-saving beans. We reach the city and search the houses and apartment blocks for supplies. There are a few zombies, but Chris makes short work of them with his fire axe. Encouragingly, there don t seem to be any other players around. I spot a pump behind the church and we gather around it, filling our bellies with delicious, probably infected, water. Our health restored, we go scavenging in a nearby fire station. Chris finds a Magnum, and I look in vain for M4 ammo. Then, suddenly, I catch a glimpse of someone in full military gear with a rifle. There s a player here with a gun! I announce over public voice chat, because I m an idiot. I lose sight of them almost immediately, but now everyone s in a panic. We circle the station and we can t see anyone, so I think maybe I imagined it. Another friend of ours is trapped at the top of a smokestack somewhere in the city. He can t get down because there are zombies at the foot of the ladder, so we decide to go and help him. We re sprinting along the main road which is a really, really bad idea in DayZ, especially in somewhere as heavily populated as Elektro. Then I hear a crack of gunfire, and my friend Emily is shot. She falls to the ground, then I do. Blackness. I load up Chris s stream on Twitch and, thanks to the delay, see Emily die again, but Chris bolts into a nearby apartment before he knows what s happened to me. Our attackers sprint down the street towards our bodies. They ve been stalking us this whole time. Then, just when he thinks he s safe, they shoot Chris through the window. We re all dead. Chris leaves, but Ben joins me when I start a new character, along with two other friends. This time we decide to head inland, away from the coast, and well away from Elektro. We work our way through the countryside, from Solnichniy to Dolina, gathering supplies. We have a pretty nice haul. Enough to keep us fed and watered all the way to the north-west airfield, where our plan is to pick up some decent weapons if we don t get sniped the instant we approach, that is. Along a dirt road, I spot a lake. We take advantage of it and fill up on water. While we re waiting for the others, Ben approaches me, and I see a message flash up on the screen saying that I ve just been force-fed a rotten banana. I have a funny taste in my mouth. my character says. I have food poisoning. Ben laughs over voice chat, not realising that he s just signed my death warrant. I scour Dolina for charcoal tablets, but in my 20 hours of playing the standalone I ve never once come across any. My character moans as the sickness gets worse. Thanks, Ben. Thanks a lot. Incredibly, while we re looting a house, he tries to do it AGAIN, this time with a kiwi fruit. But his plan backfires and he accidentally eats it himself. I m furious, so I take out my fire axe and kill him, cursing him over Skype. I could have watched him die slowly of the same ailment he gave me, but I was feeling vengeful. I loot his body and leave him for the zombies. The rest of the group are fine, but I m done for. The sickness is eating away at me. I get on my knees and ask them to kill me and end my suffering. They pummel me with their axe and baseball bat, and I see blackness once again. Chris recorded his stream of the adventure, so you can see it from his perspective here. These aren't the first times Andy's died in DayZ, and they won't be the last. He's documenting every bitter demise on his DayZ Death Diary - a chronicle of DayZ at its most melancholy.",

That post also outlines some of the priority features that should see their way into the zombie sadistic jerk survival game over the following weeks and months. \"We didn t want to compromise on the brutal and unforgiving nature of the early days of the DayZ mod so we re very surprised to see such interest as this clearly is not a game for everyone,\" writes Bohemia's Marek Spanel, \"especially considering that there are some radical changes under the hood in comparison to the mod.\" \"We re already seeing unbelievable player stories happening every day in the game even in its very limited Alpha and we re focused to make huge progress in 2014 on many areas of the game,\" he continues. \"In the short term, we re going to focus on the most critical problems you re experiencing, and at the same time we re going to work on the road to the DayZ Beta.\" That beta isn't due until much later in the year. In the shorter term, then, the team will be revisiting their roadmap towards the end of the month, but their top priorities are the following fixes and features: Server performance, stability and security Animals &amp; hunting Cooking &amp; gathering resources Playable user customizable vehicles Player created constructions in the environment More complex interactions with the environment and crafting options Streamlined user actions and interface Control and animations expanded and improved for fluidity Upgraded graphics and physics engine (including ragdoll, etc.) Support of user mods and more flexibility for user hosted servers and game types Spanel wasn't wrong about the player stories that alpha DayZ is already producing.

That's enough players to generate plenty of horrifying and hilarious survival stories. Luckily for us, a few have been caught on camera. We've picked out a few of our favourites and gathered them below to offer a glimpse of the weirder side of Bohemia's survival horror sandbox. Read on to see one man's grand quest for a DayZ high five, and an encounter with a nightmarish musical killer. The quest for a high-five in DayZ Some have entered DayZ determined to survive at any cost, others just want to spread happiness up high, down low and on the rebound. 1TimeGames posted his attempt to high five a guy coming out of Grishino. The response was non-violent, but predictable, and perfectly timed. Fortunately Koto and Sen picked up where his predecessor left off, and traveled the island recording the varying reactions to his quest for a high five. A noble cause in a post-apocalyptic world. The Gentleman Bandit Banditry is a way of life in DayZ. The best way to stay in supply is to take what you need from other players, but there's no need to be a dick about it, as Joab Gilroy demonstrates. His methodical robbery of a poorly armed player is so reasonably executed that his victim asks to team up. An Agonising Execution You've encountered a man with a broken leg dragging himself across the road in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. Do you A) laugh at him and run off or B) put the poor guy out of his misery so he can respawn and play again. Lir Ik makes the humane decision in the end, but his well intentioned attempts to axe murder a wounded and immobile man is more horrifying than it ever needed to be. Dean \"Rocket\" Hall ambushed by a bandit Not even DayZ's creators are safe from other players. In the middle of a livestream DayZ designer Dean Hall and his pals are ambushed by an unseen bandit in the dark. They hole up in a building, panicking, enjoying the same fear that all DayZ players have felt at some point in their careers. An encounter with a psychopath There are lots of murderers in DayZ, of course, but they're ordinary murderers who kill others for understandable reasons with conventional weaponry, like axes and assault rifles. It's rare to find a killer with a theatrical knack for menace, but this player did on one dark, quiet night. Survivor Sonic Also some players have started doing this. Nobody knows quite why. The Wiggle Cultists Is the collective raving of the Wiggle cultists some form of defence mechanism, like the squid spraying ink on predators? Or do they believe in the dark power of wiggling? It's impossible to tell, and nearly impossible not to giggle at the ranting and raving that greets this group of bandits. More will surely surface in the months to come as DayZ grows and grows.

How's that going, then? I dipped into DayZ for an hour to see if the festive spirit has softened the relentlessly brutal survivalist nightmare of DayZ. Will I have a super happy rainbow fun time with a mob of new friends, or get horribly axe murdered by a stranger? I think we all probably already know the answer to that one. I seem to have spawned into a Windows desktop background, but I have a spade. A spade that I refuse to raise against my fellow man on this, the day of DayZ Christmas ceasefire. There's a whole lot of grass and zombies inland, so I plan to stick to the coastline and investigate some settlements. If I'm lucky, I'll find an airport or a military base that's populated by players not shooting each other. There's no military base, but a petrol station will do nicely. It'll have an attached convenience store that might have a few bandages, or some food. There's also blatantly a zombie standing right outside - a great opportunity to find out what the undead population thinks about the Christmas ceasefire. Things deteriorate rapidly when the zombie starts clawing at my torso instead of answering my questions. Don't they know it's Christmas? I resort to interviewing my subject repeatedly with my spade instead. He keels over and stops moving, but I'm set upon by two more walkers attracted by the commotion. I give them both the gift of Christmas spade and limp towards the petrol station, badly wounded. I move into the back room of the petrol station and freeze. A human! We both do the DayZ stand-off, when strangers stand completely still for a moment, examining the others' equipment to see what level of threat they pose. He has an axe; I have a spade. We'd be evenly matched were it not for the gouts of blood spewing continuously from my chest. We both know I'm at his mercy. Will the Christmas spirit prevail? The stranger kneels down in front of me. This is awkward and a little weird until I realise that he's bandaging me up. Yes! The Christmas spirit is strong with this one. I'm so grateful I mash the keys looking for a chat button and go prone instead. Embarrassed, I stand up again slowly and back out of the building. He watches quietly, and doesn't follow. Wounded but inspired, I set off towards the next settlement, hoping to find supplies and more friendly humans. The town seems empty, so I duck into the nearest building, only to hear the tell-tale squawk of the undead nearby. Are they outside? Have they heard me? Damn. My second life starts near a build-up zone. I miss my spade, but find a wrench in a shed and continue toward town. I never make it. I'm shocked out of the exploration of a residence on the outskirts by the sound of a voice calling me. \"Hey. Come out!\" says the voice. \"You! At the window! I won't hurt you. I have no weapon. Come down.\" It's a human player talking using DayZ's local voice chat. There's something chilling about the slow delivery of his requests that makes me instantly distrust him. My instincts tell me to find a back door and run, but what cause do I have to run on this, the day of DayZ Christmas Ceasefire? I leave the house and walk out to meet him. I notice that his chest holster is empty before I see the hideous clown mask. I mentally dub him Clownface, and only then notice the axe on his back. Not so unarmed after all. \"I'm sick. I need charcoal,\" Clownface says. \"Do you have any charcoal?\" I don't. I shake my avatar's head with a waggle of the mouse. \"I need to go and find some. Will you help me on my mission?\" Still worried, I nod my head with the mouse and he sets off down the road. As I follow I start to wonder why we're running away from the town, where we're more likely to find supplies. After a few moments, Clownface stops. \"One thing I will say. Don't take my stuff. That would be a bad idea, to take my stuff.\" I freeze for a moment, and then nod, wishing my mic was plugged in. I want to explain. I want to tell him about the man in the petrol station, and how he helped me, and how I was going to write an article about DayZ and the Christmas spirit and how people can form truces in the most fragile situations, even when there's no rule of law to enforce the peace. We stand completely still, staring at each other across the road. Suddenly, he draws his axe and charges. I take a moment to react, startled by the attack. I draw the wrench under repeated blows from his weapon. Blood starts flying out of me, but I get in a few good shots. He goes down, unconscious. He mentioned that he was ill. He must have been weak. Why did he start the fight? Panicked, I keep hitting his corpse, over and over again. 'What did I do?' I wonder. Perhaps he thought I planned to murder him. Perhaps it was always his plan to kill me. He may get his wish. I'm bleeding profusely, my vision is blurred. I try to loot his corpse for bandages, but his body is slowly sliding away. Eerily, it won't stop moving, which means I can't snatch any bandages he might possess. Clownface's corpse glides into the sea, and I feel a pang of despair. DayZ is still very much in alpha. This particular bug has doomed me. I wander down the beach, knowing I'll never have time to find supplies and staunch my wounds. I'm done for. All I can do is walk and admire the waves for a few moments before my character keels over and the screen goes dark. ",

Since the game often acts as a sort of laboratory for human behavior, any proposed ceasefire in the DayZ Mod or Standalone alpha will take place as a simple but maybe revealing experiment. With its release Monday, the DayZ alpha has seen a massive influx of players and it's a time of year when people might have an hour or two to sit down with a hot beverage and explore DayZ s gorgeous, nightmarish landscape. Since so many of the survival sim s most terrifying moments usually involve encounters with other human beings rather than the game s zombie antagonists, a Christmas truce seems like the perfect way to see what the mood is like among DayZ s alpha community. Are you like the person in the motorcycle helmet who challenged me to a pointless fistfight on a lonely hilltop the other day, or are you more apt to give a hungry survivor a cold soda and a can of beans after a long trek through the woods? I guess we ll find out. And that s sort of the strange and interesting point of DayZ for me anyway the not knowing. What would you do?",
