Your medal includes detailed Season Statistics that you can view by clicking on the medal in your inventory. Review your Season One highs and lows with graphs of your CSR and playtime, or view your map-specific stats to find areas of improvement for Season Two. As we transition to Season Two, there'll be one day of Premier downtime during which your CS Rating will be recalibrated for the new season based on your Season One performance. At the start of the new Season you will need to re-establish your CS Rating by winning 10 matches. Season Two comes with some changes. Train is in and Vertigo is out, the M4A4 is a bit less expensive, and the FAMAS has some improvements to its standing and crouching accuracy (along with a price cut). And when Season Two comes to a close after the Austin Major, players who meet the requirements will be awarded a Premier Season Two Medal.

During warmup, weapons will no longer drop on the ground when changing teams. During warmup, changing teams now has a two second cooldown. Added server settings controlling which items drop on the ground during warmup period: mp_warmup_items_drop_policy, mp_warmup_items_nocost, mp_warmup_items_nocount_policy. Community servers that run with free non-droppable weapons during warmup can set these settings as follows: mp_warmup_items_drop_policy 0, mp_warmup_items_nocost 1, mp_warmup_items_nocount_policy 251. Give command will now always drop the held weapon if the given weapon needs an empty primary/secondary weapon slot to be used. For legacy behaviour, which would drop the new weapon on the ground, developers can use \"-keep_gear\" flag, e.g. give weapon_awp -keep_gear Train Improved collision fidelity on various props Updated and fixed surface types on several props Adjusted wetness levels on some surfaces Fixed various gaps in map Map Guides are now supported in the Steam Workshop for submission and subscription. Added a selector to pick which map guide gets loaded in practice mode. Annotations nodes are now visible in the radar.

Added a setting for CPU Cores Usage Preference to control how high performance and power efficiency cores are used by the game on CPUs with variable cores.

Team Spirit and FaZe Clan needed all three maps to determine a champion in front of an excited, sold-out crowd at the SPD Bank Oriental Sports Center. Down 12:5 on map 3, FaZe Clan battled back with 6 consecutive round wins—and some incredible clutches along the way—to force round 24.

Damage prediction allows clients to immediately play the audio/visual effects of inflicting damage without waiting for confirmation from the server. Damage prediction can make shooting feel significantly more responsive, but comes with the risk of occasionally being wrong (e.g. due to aim punch, tagging, or a death that your client isn't yet aware of). Predicted body shot effects (disabled by default), head shot effects (disabled by default), and kill ragdolls (enabled by default) can each be toggled separately. Damage prediction is not active when you have high ping. Updated the third-person animation that plays when a player is blinded by a flashbang. The animation now accurately represents the player's visibility level, and the pose will only show the player's arm covering their eyes when they are completely blinded.

Performance optimizations for molotov and incendiary effects. Added axis labels to the grenade line-up reticle tick marks.

To load a map guide, go to Play→Practice and toggle \"Load Map Guides\" on.

        "contents": "Fixed a case mid-spray where lag compensation wasn't aware of the user's \"Buffering to smooth over packet loss / jitter\" setting. Improved clock synchronization to better handle downstream jitter bursts. Changed the method for measuring network quality to measure how much network is negatively impacting gameplay. It now measures how often a tick is missed due to network loss or jitter. Added detailed network quality display option, which can be used to display the raw packet loss and jitter numbers. For more details see this article. Prior to the Armory Update, the network quality readout in the telemetry HUD considered packets to be \"bad\" under two circumstances. 1.) If the packet was dropped. 2.) If the packet was delivered out-of-order and was not corrected at a relatively low layer in the network stack. This was not a useful metric for two reasons. First, it counted some misdelivery events as \"bad\" even though they did not negatively impact gameplay. This was especially a problem for packet reordering. Second, it was not counting as \"bad\" packets that arrived late due to network jitter and did negatively impact gameplay. After debugging many instances of gameplay hitches with players, we determined that jitter was causing problems for many players, who believed (quite reasonably) that their network was working perfectly, since there was no packet loss. In an attempt to let these players know that jitter might be the cause of the hitches, we changed the measurement method in the Armory Update on October 2, 2024. Now, we counted a message as \"bad\" if it was lost, if packets arrived out of order in a way that could not be corrected, or if the packets experienced jitter above a threshold. For players on a network connection with significant jitter, suddenly the network quality indicator became significantly worse. Many players assumed that this meant that something had changed to introduce packet loss. Unfortunately, this method of measuring quality was also flawed. The Source 2 Engine automatically adds buffering to smooth over jitter. For many players, these automatic adjustments are enough, and the indicator was counting jittered packets as \"bad\" even when there was not negative impact on gameplay. Today's update changes the network quality readout to only measure network events that are negatively impacting gameplay. See the FAQ for more details.",

Previously, in both CS:GO and CS2, jump height could vary by up to 0.03125 of a unit depending on the distance from the map origin. Improved consistency of successfully landing on surfaces very close to the maximum height of a jump. Jump height is still affected by stamina; when using cl_showpos 2, stamina at takeoff is reported and output is color coded based on possible jump height. Fixed a bug with cl_showpos display sometimes showing incorrect jump height when jumping from sloped surfaces. Fixed some cases where the client would be pulled back down during a jump because the server disagreed that the jump had taken place. Adjusted weapon pickup logic while near the C4, prioritizing defusing over accidental weapon pick-up. Enemies will now consistently play a flinch animation on the closest hit when the bullet goes through two hitboxes of equal priority (e.g. when both right and left legs get hit). HE grenade explosions within smoke now clear the accumulated smoke screen effect on players inside that smoke within range of the HE grenade explosion. Stability improvements.

        "contents": "Counter-Strike is constantly evolving. From art, to maps, to inventive plays, and even player input, the CS community shapes the game. Scripting and automating player commands has always been contentious, but over the years some forms of scripting (e.g., jump-throws) have gained acceptance, as they enable plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible. In fact, jump-throws became such an important part of the game that we've done the work to make them reliable without any special scripting or binds (i.e., by jumping and quickly throwing a grenade). Developing one's coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike. Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we've decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn't acceptable in Counter-Strike. We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match. To prevent accidental infractions, in-game binds that include more than one movement and/or attack actions will no longer work (e.g., null-binds and jump-throw binds). If you have a keyboard that includes an input-automation feature (e.g., \"Snap Tap Mode\"), be sure to disable the feature before you join a match in order to avoid any interruption to your matches.

You can set your preferred handedness in the settings menu and then switch hands temporarily mid-round with a key press (H on US Keyboards by default). https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/897b47892c65929ccd471ccff7d5aa65696eeb6f.png The buy menu has a few new tricks. To help you decide whether to buy or save, the top right of the buy menu now features the minimum amount of money you're guaranteed to have next round (thanks Kadomos). And at the bottom you'll find the new 'Dropped Weapons' panel, where you can see (and directly pick up) any weapons that you or teammates have dropped in the buy zone. There are several more HUD/UI changes in today's update. For those of you who have memorized a library of grenade line-ups, a line-up reticle will appear shortly after you pull the pin (you can even customize the delay for each grenade type). And if you've had trouble navigating through smoke, set a Radar Map Alternate Zoom and add a Toggle Radar Zoom key binding, which will let you switch between zoom levels during a round. https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/ac9e7e5f1f6386cfec4de86e771a6fdc7206471c.png We've updated the Active Duty map pool (for both Premier and competitions), removing Overpass and bringing back Dust II.

Your CS Rating is a visible measurement of your Counter-Strike performance, and it will determine where you stand on global and regional leaderboards. To get your CS Rating, play matches in the updated Premier mode (our Active Duty Pick-Ban competitive mode) either on your own or with your friends. Additionally, today we’re starting the process of inviting as many eligible players as possible to the Limited Test. To be eligible for a CS2 Limited Test invite players must have CS:GO Prime status, an active official competitive matchmaking Skill Group, and play majority of their official matchmaking games in one of the regions where the Limited Test is available. Saving Time Over the past decade, we’ve shipped updates to the economy and weapon balance to trim the fat and reduce the number of uncontested rounds in a match of CS. Because of these changes, exciting competitive matches can be resolved with fewer rounds. And shorter matches mean players can play more, and more often. So with CS2, we’re moving to a maximum of 24 rounds in regulation time (with a 6 round overtime in case of a tie) for Premier, Competitive, and the Majors. We expect the structure and flow of matches to evolve over time as the community adapts. And we’re excited to see where they go next. ",

Over the past few years, we’ve seen professional Counter-Strike drift away from that ideal. The ecosystem has become gradually less open, with access to the highest levels of competition increasingly gated by business relationships. We think that Counter-Strike should be an open sport. So we’re going to add new requirements to running large-scale competitive events. The finer details are still in progress, but here are the broad strokes: Tournament organizers will no longer have unique business relationships or other conflicts of interest with teams that participate in their events. Invitations to all tournaments will use our ranking system (detailed here), or otherwise be determined by open qualifiers. Any compensation for participating teams—prize pool or otherwise—will be made public and will be driven by objective criteria that can be inspected by the community. Since tournament organizers have existing long term commitments, these requirements will take effect as of 2025. There will be some rough edges to the transition, but we’re committed to the long-term health of Counter-Strike as a sport and are looking forward to its bright and open future. ",

Now, all but one of the traders listed in the document have been banned, meaning that about £1.5 million of in-game skins will no longer be available for purchase, potentially meaning they're removed from the game's economy for good. The owner of CSGORoll denied all the accusations in a lengthy Twitter post, writing, \"I own a gamified skins trading platform, by law, this is not classified as a casino in our largest markets because we do not offer cash withdrawals. Contracted skins suppliers are not allowed to play games on the platform, thus we can legally pay them crypto for their skins to always ensure that we have a liquid marketplace.

You can check out the release notes to see what's new, but here are some of the big changes in today's update: New Loadout and Buy Menu Head to the loadout to customize the weapons you take into battle! Make your choices for the T and CT sides with four pistols, five mid-range weapons (SMGs and Heavy), and five rifles (yes, you can bring both M4's). Just drag and drop to adjust your buy menu however you see fit. The buy menu has gotten a few extra upgrades, including a refund option for any weapons you purchased in the round and haven't used yet, and indicators to help you track what your teammates are carrying. Workshop Tools The Limited Test now also includes all-new Counter-Strike 2 Workshop Tools, which can be enabled and downloaded from the in-game settings menu. These tools will allow community contributors to create weapon finishes, stickers, and maps. There's much more in today's update, from smoke grenade adjustments to input and animation. Jump into the Limited Test and send your feedback to cs2team valvesoftware com (make sure to include CS2LT in your title).",

        "contents": "Mirage has replaced Dust II on official Counter-Strike 2 Limited Test matchmaking servers. Introducing Counter-Strike 2 Workshop Tools which can be enabled and downloaded from in-game settings menu--these tools will allow community contributors to create weapon finishes, stickers, and maps. Note: the Steam Community Workshop does not yet support uploading CS2 maps. The level editor (Hammer) now leverages GPU accelerated raytracing to both preview and bake lighting for CS2 maps. This significantly speeds up compile times, but as a result a GPU capable of raytracing is required for Hammer to be fully functional. Hammer GPU Minimum Specs: Nvidia 2060Ti 6gb (2080Ti+ recommended) AMD 6600XT (6800XT+ recommended) The player loadout has been revised: Players have 1 Starting Pistol slot, 4 Pistol slots, 5 Mid-tier slots (previously \"SMGs\" and \"Heavy\"), and 5 Rifle slots, per team. Assign any (side-appropriate) weapon to any slot within its category. Supports drag-and-drop and has been redesigned to fit in on a single screen. The in-game buy menu interface has been revised: The wheel has been replaced with a grid showing all purchase options at the same time. Teammate purchases are displayed on the buy menu. Weapon \"stats\" display has been replaced with simple straightforward descriptions. Players can now refund any purchase that was purchased in the same round and has not been used. Existing CS:GO items on the Steam Community Market can be inspected in Counter-Strike 2. Sub-tick movement is now more precise and less \"floaty\" (per player-feedback). Releasing movement keys now correctly convey their sub-tick timing. The top player of a triple-stack can now shoot. Fine-tuned weapon aim punch recovery to be latency-independent during sub-tick recovery on the client. Fine-tuned view punch camera shake effect during shooting to be both latency-independent and synchronized with all other sub-tick shooting effects on the client. Improved lighting/rendering when smoke overlaps multiple distinctly lit regions. HE grenade effect times on smoke has been reduced. Shotguns now create larger holes in smoke volumes. Adjustments to the viewmodel 'inspect' to remove animation popping. Several viewmodel and blending animation fixes. Improved traversal animation. Jumping into the air and running off a ledge is now differentiated to allow for separate character motion. Player's own footstep sounds are now predicted on the client for a latency-independent experience. Improved performance and responsiveness in windowed and full-screen windowed modes. Fixed several bugs and rendering artifacts. Fixed bug that would cause input to become permanently broken when multiple commands were bound to one key. Multi-binds are back, except for jump-throw binds (which are now a skillful part of CS). Commands bound to mouse wheels will now be reliably executed. Fixed bug that would cause input to execute incorrectly after taking over a bot in practice mode. Inspecting weapons is now predicted on the client for a more responsive experience. VAC will now live ban and gracefully terminate the match at the end of the round (unless it was the last round and the cheater lost). The match will not affect any participants' Skill Group. Players that were not lobbied with the VAC-banned player will earn XP for match. ",

First up, the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters\">FPS game's</a> Mirage map has seen the most substantial adjustments. The devs have added an \"AWP wallbang spot\" by the Palace scaffolding, meaning players who stop there are now vulnerable to attacks from within the building. In addition, the T entrance to mid is now wider than before which should give a better view of connector, and the B site balcony's trim is now lower than it was pre-update, revealing jump peeks more obviously to the T-side.

That's 1.5 million players concurrently, to be clear, as in that many people all playing the shooter at one time, certainly impressive for such an old title. This new record also makes it the game with the second-biggest concurrent player count ever, behind PUBG Battlegruonds' own record of 3.2 million - a bit of a difference. This record is just the newest one this year, as it actually achieved a record of 1.4 million players just <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/14m-of-us-were-simultaneously-playing-csgo-this-weekend-and-yes-thats-a-new-record\">a couple of weeks ago</a>.

Anubis is being added to Active Duty and and Dust2 is being removed. But both maps are still available in Casual, Deathmatch, and Competitive modes. We're also making some adjustments to weapons. The AWP has had its magazine size reduced to five bullets (so make them count!), and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long ranges. Try the changes out and let us know what you think!

IEM Katowice will be the first flagship tournament of the ESL Pro Tour will take place from February 10-12, 2023.

In the last 24 hours, as the CS:GO birthday celebrations kick off, the game has recorded its highest concurrent player count in over a year - which is only a fraction off the game's all-time peak player count, too. It's clear that the decision from CS:GO to <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/tuscan-tenth-anniversary\">revive a 1.6 map to celebrate</a> was a good one. Looking at the aforementioned database, it can be seen that (at the time of writing) CS:GO has a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of around 1,040,000 - this is just shy of the all-time concurrent player count peak of 1,309,000 recorded in April 2020. If you're wondering where that peak came from, it appears to be a result of the IEM Katowice 2020 esports tournament. As for the current spike in players? It's hard to say, but you have to imagine that the start of the game's tenth anniversary has had a part to play. Interestingly, SteamDB also reveals that, following a spike in Twitch viewership for CS:GO on July 7, it's seen a steady decline while the player count rises. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/tenth-birthday-player-count\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/get-10-year-coin\">CS:GO 10 year coin - how to get the birthday coin</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/tuscan-tenth-anniversary\">CS:GO revives a 1.6 map to celebrate its tenth birthday</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/stewie2k-valorant-announcement\">Stewie2k latest CS:GO pro to set sights on Valorant</a> ",

Over the past 12 months alone, we've seen more players than ever before (averaging over 20 million monthly unique players), record viewership for Majors (2.7m concurrent viewers), and massive community support with over $70 million raised for professional organizations, teams, and players. The future could not look brighter. Happy Birthday, CS:GO.",

While that might lead you to believe that the 24-year old was finished with competitive gaming altogether, you'd be wrong. During a Twitch stream on August 11, just over two weeks after his retirement, Stewie2k revealed his ambitious plans to compete professionally at the top level of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/valorant\">Valorant</a> esports, even adding that he wouldn't be put off if there wasn't any initial interest from teams. \"Every day I'll be on stream.

Even if I miss franchising, I'm down to keep streaming - watch and be the student of the game - and then get picked up.\" Following on from this, Stewie2k added a hopeful \"we'll see how it pans out\" in regards to his upcoming attempts to get into a Valorant esports team in time for the start of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/valorant/regional-leagues-2023-report\">2023's partnered, region-based league</a> - a system akin to Riot Games' League of Legends LEC and LCS competitions. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/stewie2k-valorant-announcement\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/s1mple-complains-devs\">The solution to CS:GO's problems is s1mple, he says</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/recalibrate-ranks\">CS:GO update will strip players of their rank, at least temporarily</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> ",

Valve doesn't update CSGO all too often and when it does the community always finds out there's more than one major issue unresolved. Of course, it's hard to fix a game with so many moving parts, but it looks like pro player Oleksandr 's1mple' Kostyliev has had enough of waiting around to see his beloved shooter fixed. S1mple has put the developers on blast with claims that he could fix CSGO with a \"few millions\". Following a CSGO update that temporarily stripped players of their ranks in-game, S1mple took to Twitter to share his thoughts on the current state of the game - and it's safe to say that he is less than happy with how things are going. To summarise, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/s1mpleO/status/1557035141520052225\">s1mple</a> has stated that with a \"few millions\", he would be able to improve Valve's shooter, \"not only professionally, but also for players who rarely log in and want to enjoy the game\". In his social media post on the matter, he reiterated that he was \"not kidding\" - adding that he would be able to improve player numbers at the very least. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/s1mple-complains-devs\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/stewie2k-valorant-announcement\">Stewie2k latest CS:GO pro to set sights on Valorant</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/recalibrate-ranks\">CS:GO update will strip players of their rank, at least temporarily</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> ",

Last week, the development team did just that, reducing the gun's mag size<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/update-june-15\"> from 25 rounds to 20</a>. However, some fans think the nerf hasn't gone far enough. And that's because, despite reducing the gun's mag capacity, it's not really changed the meta all too much. The assault rifle is still devastating in the right hands. Sure, you've got less bullets to play around with, but for top level players in the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/ranks\">CS:GO ranks </a>and on the world stage, this nerf has done very little to shake things up. To counter that fact, many are now calling for the gun to be reduced in price. \"Change the price of the M4A1-S and the M4A4,\" Jacob 'pimp' Winneche tweets. \"The better weapon is still the cheapest option, hence why the vast majority won't switch.

FPS fans will know that <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>'s 10-year anniversary is right around the corner on August 21, but so far all players have had to commemorate the event is the CSGO10 sticker event in-game. However, it appears that Valve might have a little surprise in store for the anniversary that will make the game look a whole lot prettier if rumours and a leak prove true. CS:GO has infamously run on the original Source's code since its 2012 release, but rumours and speculation have only increased as the 10th anniversary draws closer. Now, CS:GO YouTuber and streamer '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWarOwl\">TheWarOwl</a>' seems to have slipped up mid-stream and leaked that the competitive shooter is being ported to Source 2. \"I'm honestly waiting for the Source update in August,\" TheWarOwl says in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/vgz1tb/warowl_accidently_leaks_source_2_release_date/\">video clip</a>. \"Oh, I shouldn't have said that.\" He could be dead-pan joking of course, but it should be noted that TheWarOwl was a software developer long before his YouTube career talking about CS:GO kicked off, so it would make sense if he knew what was going on behind the scenes. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/source-2-update-thewarowl\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/counter-strike-2-leaks-csgo-2-release-date-rumours\">Counter-Strike 2 leaks claim CSGO Source 2 beta is weeks away</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/crosshair-settings\">The best CS:GO crosshairs</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">The best competitive FPS games in 2023</a> ",

The June 15 CS:GO update released by Valve is far from the biggest we've ever seen, but for some players it'll have a significant impact. Heading up the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes</a> for this update is a nerf to the M4A1-S. The assault rifle will see its magazine size shrink from 25 to 20 bullets, reverting an ammo capacity buff the weapon received a few years ago. This nerf is necessary because the M4A1-S has been rather strong over the last few months, thanks to a damage buff it received last year at the start of Operation Riptide. While the weapon's desirable damage output remains, there is now the drawback of having fewer bullets at your disposal, which might put some players off. Those who are accurate and economical with their shooting, however, will probably still find the gun viable. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/update-june-15\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">The best competitive FPS games in 2022</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/major-antwerp-karrigan-oldest-winner\">Karrigan becomes the oldest CS:GO Major winner with PGL Antwerp win</a> ",

But, after a whirlwind 18 months, the Dane has finally cemented his - and FaZe's name - into the history books with a win at the PGL Antwerp Major 2022. This now officially makes him the oldest player in CS:GO to ever win a Major. That title was previously held by Daniil 'Zeus' Teslenko, who, at the age of 29, took the PGL Major Krakow 2017 by storm with his team Gambit. karrigan, however, now holds that title at the grand old age of 32 - and it's been a long time coming. Karrigan was, of course, part of the ill-fated FaZe Clan team which blew a 15-9 lead on Inferno at the ELEAGUE Boston Major finals in 2018 against Cloud9. Many at the time believed karrigan's chance to ever win a Major was over. However, the IGL never gave up and Antwerp proved to be the final stage - something he's been working towards for years. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/major-antwerp-karrigan-oldest-winner\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/monesy-smoke-bug-pgl-antwerp-2022\">Valve fixes m0NESY smoke bug during PGL Antwerp 2022</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/knife-commands\">CS:GO knife commands: how to try any knife for free</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/most-expensive-skins\">The most expensive CS:GO skins</a> ",

Only the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/best-skins\">best CS:GO skins</a> - or perhaps the rarest - deserve to be at the top of the list of most expensive CS:GO skins however, so if you're looking for the ultimate flex and have the cash ready to prove it, then look no further than our guide on the most expensive CS:GO skins below. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/most-expensive-skins\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/how-to-show-fps\">How to show FPS in CS:GO</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/moan-bind\">CS:GO moan bind: how to set up a player radio moan keybind</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cheats\">CS:GO cheats: how to spot a cheater</a> ",

In a statement providing context ahead of the release of the punishments, ESIC also says that provisional suspensions have been handed out to three coaches that were meant to be involved with the CS:GO Antwerp Major, which kicks off in a few days time. ESIC's first wave of punishments <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/37-coaches-banned-spectator-bug\">happened in September 2020</a>, where 37 CS:GO coaches were handed bans ranging from four months to three years. At the time, ESIC said that only 20% of the 15.2 terabytes of evidence it had collected had been examined. It now seems the investigation is about to finally conclude. In its May 5 <a href=\"https://esic.gg/press-release/esic-to-issue-charges-resulting-from-historical-spectator-bug-investigation/\">statement,</a> ESIC says that it has identified a total of three different spectator bug variants - a \"static\" bug, a \"third-person\" view bug, and a \"free roam\" bug which allows full movement around the map when triggered. The latter is being deemed as the most serious, and due to its efficacy, ESIC deems this as a form of cheating and will punish guilty parties with tougher measures. It says that only three coaches have been found to have experienced and used this bug. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/antwerp-major-esic-bans\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cheapest-knife\">The cheapest CS:GO knives</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/stickers-antwerp-2022\">The CS:GO stickers for the PGL Antwerp Major have dropped</a> ",

Years ago, however, there was a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/7q7uf9/it_has_been_almost_a_year_but_the_instant_bomb/\">glitch that allowed Terrorists to instantly plant</a> and detonate the bomb - and now it's back.

Pinhorox titled the post 'Never experienced this before. Is this new?' which goes to show just how old the returning exploit is.

A Reddit post by user '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/u0l6vs/neymar_scored_3_goals_for_psg_yesterday_and_then/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8F%20ENCE%20down%20FaZe%20up&utm_campaign=TLDR%20on%20CSGO%20%23262\">AbsoluteDealer</a>' brought our attention to Neymar's journey from football field to first-person shooter, as an image taken from the star's social media suggests Neymar went home after the recent football match between PSG and Clermont Foot and decided to play the FPS game as a way to unwind. The image shows his gaming desk setup with <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo\">CS:GO</a> running, accompanied by the number \"3\" and a football emoji, a win emoji, then the letters \"CS.\" The only full word reads \"bebado,\" which according to Google Translate means \"drunk\" in Brazilian Portuguese.

Previous workshop submissions are eligible for the capsule, just make sure to tag them so we can find them more easily. All submissions for this event must be completed and submitted to the workshop by July 21st, 2022, and the capsule will release on or around CS:GO's 10th birthday (August 21, 2022). All items submitted for this event will still be eligible for future sticker capsules. Good luck and have fun; we are excited to see what the community comes up with!",

You'll have eight attempts to guess the skin - and after making your first guess - you'll have to work out whether you're on the right track by looking at the condition, rarity, price, paint, weapon, and category. For example, if the skin of the day is a Factory New M4A4 Asiimov and you guess a Factory New M4A4 Bullet Rain, the crates for condition, rarity, and weapon would be green. The category crate indicates whether a gun is T-sided, CT-sided, or both - so you'll want to scrub up on your buy menu options before you give this a shot. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/wordle-csgordle\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/blast-russia-ban\">BLAST bans Russian CS:GO teams from events following Ukraine conflict</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/best-skins\">The best CS:GO skins</a> ",

However, simply lobbing utility around is one thing, but learning how to use a CS:GO jump bind to win you a round is another. Knowing all the best grenade line-ups can be the thing that separates a successful bombsite execution from a CT-side spray down, and many of those set-plays utilise what is known as the jump throw. Jump throws give extra power and height to your standard line-up throw, meaning that you can reach further distances and perform your throws from safer, more reliable angles. Employing the jump throw can mean that you block off entry to a site before the T-side can get there, or deny a critical sightline for the CT-side AWP all from the safety of T-spawn. Furthermore, the <strong>CS:GO jump throw bind</strong> specifically gives reliability and consistency to your throws, meaning that the jump and the throw actions are perfectly synchronized every time - you'll never disappoint your teammates with an out-of-bounds smoke again. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/jump-throw-bind\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/how-to-show-fps\">How to show FPS in CS:GO</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/moan-bind\">CS:GO moan bind: how to set up a player radio moan keybind</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cheats\">CS:GO cheats: how to spot a cheater</a> ",

For years now, Surf has been one of the most popular custom modes in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and that's because players have the opportunity to ride the waves of triangular ramps in a 'floor is lava'-style scenario. The trouble with <strong>CS:GO surf</strong> gameplay is that it can look like the easiest thing in the world when done right, but in reality it is far from that. Professional surfers float through the mode's most complicated and convoluted maps with ease, knowing every turn to make and calculating the exact speed they need to make each gap. On the flip side, inexperienced players can often find themselves over-compensating a sharp turn or pressing the wrong keys, resulting in a loss of speed and a fast route back to the beginning. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/surf\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">The 10 best competitive FPS games September 2023</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/rival-fps-game-mountaintop-studios\">Mountaintop Studios reveals playtest for CSGO and Valorant rival FPS</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/s1mple-settings\">s1mple settings, crosshair, and config for CS:GO</a> ",

From the images on the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2648825425\">mod's page</a>, the CS:GO map looks like a pretty spacious, well, space for battling it out one-against-one. There are futuristic, sleek-looking hallways lit by beams of floor-level light to tear up and down, and use to sneak up on your foe. Then there are workspaces full of obstacles to navigate and use for cover, as well as what look like grander rooms with multiple levels to tackle, and multiple entryways to dash in and out of. The story behind the map hinges on the CTs having expanded into space, which is throwing a challenge to the terrorists. They've decided to try and take down the space station's central nuclear generator, switching off security and clearing out the place as they go, as the modder explains. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/map-space-station-1v1\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-extraction-insertion-changes\">New Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update brings a batch of Riptide map changes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-county-basalt-changes\">New CS:GO update brings a bunch of County, Basalt, Dust 2 map changes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/orion-map-wingman\">This impressive CS:GO fan map brings a Half-Life-like spin to classic Wingman</a> ",

The latter gets the biggest batch of updates, kicking off with various upgrades to its middle zone, both \"visually and to gameplay\".

The windows found at the site are now broken into pieces \"due to a classic smoke grenade issue\" - before the change, players were visible inside smoke when standing near the breakable windows, so that's been addressed.

Join us for the next two weeks as 24 teams battle for their share of a $2,000,000 prize pool and the chance to be crowned CS:GO’s next Major Champion! There’s still time to support your favorite teams at the Major by picking up a Viewer Pass or some team stickers and patches. And don’t forget to make your picks in the Pick’Em challenge before the first matches begin! It’s been a while, so here’s a quick recap on how the Majors work: First, teams are sorted through Regional Major Ranking events, and the number of teams invited from each region depends on how well that region performed in the last Major. The top 8 ranked teams are invited as Legends, the next 8 as Challengers, and the last 8 as Contenders. Then, the Major begins with the ‘Challengers’ stage where Challengers and Contenders compete in a Swiss format (three wins and you move on, three losses and you’re eliminated). Next is the ‘Legends’ stage, where Legends face off against the top 8 from the prior stage, again in a Swiss format. Finally, the top 8 teams reach the Playoffs, a single-elimination bracket where the winner takes all!",

Valve has shared patch notes for CS:GO's October 7 update, which folds in tweaks and fixes to County, Basalt, Ravine, and more. County - the almost <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/map-danger-zone-county\">Far Cry 5-like map</a> that joined CS:GO with Op. Riptide - is in for the biggest round of changes. Valve has rolled out fixes which address things like collision on aspen tree models (to stop players getting stuck on them), various other \"stuck spots\" that were occurring when players jumped, and global sound on bunker doors. The studio's also improved the collision on cliff models in the map, shallowed out the waterfall floor so players can pick up items, and fixed some floating objects. There are some more significant, gameplay-impacting changes in the mix, too. Valve has disabled physics in the creek house's window and renovated the haunted mansion, which includes closing some of its rooms - so it sounds like the flow of that space will be a little different next time you hop in. The bridge's left-side killzone has been removed, too, and some tweaks now stop players escaping the map through the beach area using bump mines. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-county-basalt-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/orion-map-wingman\">This impressive CS:GO fan map brings a Half-Life-like spin to classic Wingman</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/riptide-hotfix-patch-notes\">CS:GO Riptide patch increases maximum griefing cooldown penalty to 14 days</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/operation-riptide\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Operation Riptide has just dropped</a> ",

Set in a research base called Orion, the map looks pretty darn great, and like it would perhaps appeal to fans of another genre giant: Half-Life. Creators KlixX (environment art), Slimek (level design and material creation), and Squidski (3D art and level design help) have posted a new CS:GO map set in the Orion base - the same location as their popular <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238607969\">Hostage Wingman map</a>, shared last year - which this time lets you play the classic Wingman mode in the facility. While the maps appear to differ slightly from each other in layout, the description for the latest says it's \"set in a remote top secret research facility\", and sees the Phoenix faction \"trying to sabotage the scientists' work on space exploration\", with counter-terrorist agents being sent in to stop them. From the screenshots shared, the map - like its predecessor - looks really impressive. We can see various futuristic-looking hangars, corridors, and other hubs across the space base that look like they'd play host to some intense, close-quarters combat, with each zone seemingly colour-coded to let you know which part of the facility you're in. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/orion-map-wingman\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/riptide-hotfix-patch-notes\">CS:GO Riptide patch increases maximum griefing cooldown penalty to 14 days</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/operation-riptide\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Operation Riptide has just dropped</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/stockholm-major-2021-tickets\">The CS:GO Stockholm Major is going ahead, and tickets go on sale next week</a> ",

There's a handful of noteworthy changes with the patch, but the most notable are that the studio has stopped the game's Terrorist side from being able to pick up the Riot Shield, and that the maximum cooldown penalty for griefing has been increased by a whole lot. First up, that cooldown change. The maximum cooldown penalty for griefing in the game has been dialled up by a pretty huge amount, with Valve explaining in the patch notes that it's been \"increased from one day to 14 days\". That's good news for players keen to see bad behaviour addressed, with this surely being a significant motivator to cut out the griefing and play nice. As for the Riot Shield, this is a new weapon type added to the multiplayer shooter with Operation Riptide, which was - as you'd probably expect - only supposed to be available to the Counter-Terrorist side through the game's buy menu in Casual Hostage map groups. However, the notes suggest the T-side could get their hands on the new bit of defensive kit through CS:GO's \"buy-via-donate\" option - so, the ability to do that has now been removed. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/riptide-hotfix-patch-notes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/operation-riptide\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Operation Riptide has just dropped</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/stockholm-major-2021-tickets\">The CS:GO Stockholm Major is going ahead, and tickets go on sale next week</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-exile\">This popular CSGO map brings hostage rescue to the spooky, snowy wilds</a> ",

For starters, there have been some updates to playlists. Players can now finally host private Premier matches on Valve's own servers, and can invite friends to compete in these matches with queue codes. Seemingly as a result of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/long-games-mr15\">recent debates around the length of matches in CS:GO</a>, Valve has also added the option to play in shorter competitive matches. As well as the usual 30-round matches you can now also play 16-round, first-to-nine matches that Valves estimates will take around 25 minutes to complete. In the gameplay department, there are a number of small but controversial changes on the way. Grenades can now be dropped for teammates like you can with weapons, which could see the development of a specific grenade-focused player role.

Available by grabbing the new operation pass on Steam, CS:GO Operation Riptide introduces some pretty big updates to how you can dive into the shooter. One of these is through a new private matchmaking queues feature. This lets you generate a queue code for sharing with pals - or with people all in the same Steam group - to set up a private Premier match on Valve's servers. \"Pair up, form your teams, or solo queue and let the matchmaker sort it out,\" the new operation overview explains. Elsewhere, Riptide ushers in the option to pick from one of two match lengths on official (competitive matchmaking) CS:GO servers: short (MR16) and long (MR30) - or you can opt for 'no preference' if you're happy to dip into whichever. Team Deathmatch has also got some new options, with an added choice between \"Classic Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch (first team to 100 kills wins), and Free-for-all Deathmatch (all players are enemies)\". <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/operation-riptide\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/stockholm-major-2021-tickets\">The CS:GO Stockholm Major is going ahead, and tickets go on sale next week</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-exile\">This popular CSGO map brings hostage rescue to the spooky, snowy wilds</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-stockholm-major\">CS:GO Stockholm Major looking more likely with coming restrictions lift</a> ",

One of the latest, which is picking up a whole lot of five-star ratings, is Exile - a hostage rescue wingman map that takes you somewhere a little different than most of CS:GO's main maps. Created by CS:GO fans Hi and Kubader, Exile is set in the remote wilds of northwest Canada, in a snowy - and pretty spooky - night-time village with a ton of atmosphere. The story revolves around the rescue of two blokes from the game's Anarchist faction headed into witness protection who have been nabbed by some enemies, who - naturally - need recovering by the map's players. As pointed out by a bunch of players so far in comments on Exile's Steam Workshop page and YouTube preview clip (below), it's an impressive (and pretty professional) looking creation and something a bit different for fans to try out. The map's covered in frost and snow, and is pretty sparsely populated with buildings, so you're going to have to be careful how you tackle it lest you leave yourself out in the open - though the atmospheric fog should help you to fly a little under the radar of enemies' sights. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-exile\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-stockholm-major\">CS:GO Stockholm Major looking more likely with coming restrictions lift</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-music-kits-polka-metal\">CS:GO gets new music kits, with polka-metal and Star Wars game composer's tunes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-mirage-story-mode-mod\">CS:GO fan creates \"Mirage story mode\" with mission, secrets, and extended map</a> ",

The Swedish government has announced that it's going to be lifting more COVID-19-related restrictions in late September, including some around hosting public events, which means it's increasingly possible the Major will be happening there in October. Back in July PGL, the Major's organising body, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/major-2021-location\">said it was hopeful</a> that the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters\">FPS game's</a> upcoming tournament would still take place in Sweden's capital city, but with restrictions still in place due to the uncertain nature of the continuing pandemic, there were still some questions hanging over whether it could go ahead as planned. At the time, the body explained that it had a backup plan in place in the event that the Major couldn't go ahead in Stockholm, having been in touch with two other European countries that could act as alternative hosts if needed. Now, as The Local.se <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20210907/will-sweden-lift-its-next-round-of-covid-restrictions-in-september/\">reports</a>, the limit on how many people can attend both public and private events is due to be removed in Sweden as of September 29, along with other changes, such as the recommendation to work from home in the country. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-stockholm-major\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-music-kits-polka-metal\">CS:GO gets new music kits, with polka-metal and Star Wars game composer's tunes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-mirage-story-mode-mod\">CS:GO fan creates \"Mirage story mode\" with mission, secrets, and extended map</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-sniper-games\">The best sniper games on PC</a> ",

Changing that would be like making football games shorter - so why does the debate surrounding the game's supposedly overindulgent length resurface every year? Solving this issue could be as simple as switching back to a max rounds 12 (MR12) system used in early CS 1.5-6 and repopularised by Riot Games' Valorant - but with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive it might not be that simple. Unlike other esports game where balance adjustments are commonplace, CS:GO is sensitive to change: it is, after all, a formula that has largely stayed the same for 20 years now. However, the competitive scene is at a crossroads, with the most recent return to LAN at IEM Cologne 2021 reigniting conversations surrounding the length of games. Valorant has offered the first real challenge in a long time to CS:GO's title as the top tier FPS esport, and it will be up to Valve (and even the tournament organisers) to decide whether the length of the games are a necessary sacrifice to stay at the top. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/long-games-mr15\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/stockholm-major-host-update\">PGL \"still hopes\" to host CS:GO Major in Sweden, confirms two backup hosts</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/iem-katowice-heroic-covid-test\">Heroic CS:GO player tests positive for COVID-19 at IEM Cologne 2021</a> ",

CS:GO fan Pyro has created a \"Mirage story mode\" mod that essentially extends the map with a bunch of new places and secrets, and gives you a main mission to complete in the city at sunset - and it's already proving a bit of a hit with players. Pyro explains that their mod is a \"co-op / single-player game\" which takes place in the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters\">FPS game's</a> Moroccan-style bomb defusal Mirage map at dusk. The mission it sets you is all about tracking down and snatching up some hidden documents, \"but it won't be easy\", as the creator says. You'll need to defeat opponents along the way and find passages and other items that'll help you gain entry to the map's tower, taking care as you go. The setting won't be Mirage quite as you know it, as Pyro's extended it with \"more interiors, places, and secrets\". As shown in the mod's image previews, there are environmental riddles you'll need to solve as you go, secret interiors to discover, and pins to track down and collect. It looks like these'll be recorded in a bespoke room so you can keep track of which ones you've nabbed and which are left to find. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-mirage-story-mode-mod\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-music-kits-polka-metal\">CS:GO gets new music kits, with polka-metal and Star Wars game composer's tunes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-sniper-games\">The best sniper games on PC</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-griefing-report-changes\">CS:GO update adds griefing report changes and Mocha, Pitstop tweaks</a> ",

The event's called 'Dreams and Nightmares' and has a prize pool of a whopping $1 million. The contest is all about designing new CS:GO weapon skins around the theme of - yep, you guessed it - dreams and nightmares. The developer says it's on the lookout for ten \"original and shippable, dream-themed weapon finishes\" in a press release, and that each of those winning entries will earn their creator $100,000, as well as get added into the live game. To get an idea of what the studio's looking for, you can head to a <a href=\"http://counter-strike.net/dreams\">new site</a> Valve's launched for the contest at that link, which is full of examples of the kind of flavours and themes the studio's keen to see. There are also some handy links to guides that can help you make your own weapon finish on the site if you're keen to enter but are new to creating workshop content. The studio also stresses that \"all elements of the submission must be original\", and encourages entrants to include \"concept art, mood boards, and images from which you have pulled inspiration\" to show your process. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-dreams-and-nightmares-art-contest\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-griefing-report-changes\">CS:GO update adds griefing report changes and Mocha, Pitstop tweaks</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/major-2021-location\">CS:GO Major organiser \"still hopes\" the event can go ahead in Stockholm</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/player-count-fall\">CSGO's player count has fallen by nearly 17% since Valve started charging for Prime</a> ",

We are looking for 10 original dream or nightmare-themed weapon finishes for CS:GO. Each of the 10 winning entries will earn $100,000. Beyond submitting your original weapon finish to the CS:GO Workshop, all you need to enter is a non-limited Steam account. And yes, teams of more than one person can also enter. To help content creators get a better feel for what we’re looking for we’ve launched a dedicated web site for the contest. Here you will find more info on the types of finishes we’re looking for, examples of the Dreams & Nightmares theme, info on how to enter, details of the contest, and more. We've also created a sub forum in CS:GO's Discussions for artists, technical artists, and others to collaborate on contest-themed submissions and ideas. We launched the Workshop on Steam almost 10 years ago in the hopes of creating a centralized hub for community created content. Since then, over five million content creators have submitted and published over 20 million new items for a variety of games on Steam, making them available to millions of gamers around the world. And, as everyone who plays these games knows – including CS players – many of the most iconic in-game items, maps, and more have been authored by members of the community. The Dreams & Nightmares Content Contest is designed to help further support this community. If you have any questions or comments about the contest, please email us at csgoteamfeedback (at) valvesoftware (dot) com using the subject “Dreams & Nightmares.” Get started today; submissions are due October 21, 2021!",

The PGL CS:GO Major in Stockholm is due to take place on October 23, with the big finale on November 7, and is set to be the first LAN Major since summer 2019. However, with the global pandemic still ongoing, rules around what can be hosted in Sweden have meant there are some questions hanging over the tournament. For example, the biggest event in the Dota 2 calendar - The International 10 - recently <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dota-2/ti10-date-romania\">had to be moved to Bucharest, Romania</a> from its original planned host city, Stockholm, due to Swedish officials deciding that esports could not be classified as 'elite sporting events'. The organisation explains that it's currently \"in direct discussions with the Swedish authorities and working together to find a solution to still host the PGL Major in Stockholm\", and details some of the restrictions that the event might face, though it notes that these could potentially lift on September 15, depending on the state of things around the pandemic at that time. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/major-2021-location\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-griefing-report-changes\">CS:GO update adds griefing report changes and Mocha, Pitstop tweaks</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-dreams-and-nightmares-art-contest\">CS:GO devs launch 'Dreams and Nightmares' $1 million art contest</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/player-count-fall\">CSGO's player count has fallen by nearly 17% since Valve started charging for Prime</a> ",

Recently though, a rather strange discovery using CS:GO's player radio function has seen players looking for a rather different keybind. It's not one to aid in gameplay, but one that will instead bewilder your teammates and opposition instead. It has come to be known as the CS:GO moan keybind. Why is it called that? Well, because with the press of a key, you can trigger the 'moan' you hear from a CS:GO character's death cry. Recently, players have managed to create commands for the player radio that can not only result in your character making some questionable noises, but also produce messages that trick people into thinking you've been VAC banned.

But now, as players continue to experiment with radio commands, more and more techniques are being unearthed. Unsurprisingly, the online community have found a new way to use their new-found powers for evil with fake in-game messages to confuse others in their lobby. Now that most are familiar with the alt-f4 pranks, CS:GO players can instead troll each other with messages that are almost indistinguishable from official messages sent in the chat by the game.

However, every game mode is still available, as are community servers and workshop maps. Valve has simply put ranked mode behind a paywall in order to discourage cheaters.

We see new players entering CS:GO all the time, and it’s as important as ever that anyone in the world can pick up and play the game for free. Along with all the gameplay that we made available for free, new players had access to drops, Ranks, Skill Groups, and a free path to Prime matchmaking. Unfortunately, over time, those benefits have become an incentive for bad actors to hurt the experience of both new and existing players. So today we’re revising the offering for new players. New players can still play every game mode, play on community servers, and play workshop maps. However, they will no longer receive XP, Ranks, drops, or Skill Groups; those features are now exclusively available to Prime Status players. New players can still upgrade to Prime by purchasing the Prime Status Upgrade from the Steam store, however there is no longer a free path to Prime. And if you purchase the upgrade in the next two weeks, your current Skill Group and XP progress will carry over. Introducing ‘Unranked’ When new players play Competitive, Wingman, and Danger Zone, their matches will still use skill-based matchmaking, but players will not earn a Skill Group. Prime players can also play Unranked matches, where their Skill Group will not be affected and where there are no lobby Skill Group restrictions. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a new arrival, GL and HF! Today's release notes can be found below. Release Notes for 6/3/2021 Non-Prime status accounts will no longer earn XP, Ranks, Skill Groups, item drops, or Prime status through play time. Non-Prime accounts will not be able to participate in Ranked matches. Non-Prime accounts will not be able to activate Bonus Rank XP items and can no longer claim Service Medals. Introducing Unranked matches for Competitive, Wingman, and Danger Zone game modes. While still formed using skill-based matchmaking, Unranked matches do not affect Skill Group and have no Skill Group party restrictions. Non-Prime accounts are restricted to Unranked, whereas Prime accounts may choose between Ranked and Unranked. Ranked matches will always be with other Prime players, exclusively, whereas Unranked matches will be created from the mixed pool of Non-Prime players and Prime players that have chosen to play Unranked. Added \"DebugDrawBoxAngles\" to draw oriented bounding boxes. Usage: DebugDrawBoxAngles( ent.GetOrigin(), ent.GetBoundingMins(), ent.GetBoundingMaxs(), ent.GetAngles(), r, g, b, a, time); Added \"GetBoundingMinsOriented\" and \"GetBoundingMaxsOriented\" functions that return the axis-aligned bounding box of an entity taking its current orientation into account. Scrimmage has been removed from Competitive matchmaking, and has been replaced by Unranked matchmaking. Added Import button to Workshop Workbench that takes a .tga file and generates a .vtf file. If the .tga file name contains \"_normal\" the generated .vtf file will be compiled with the 'normal' flag. ",

It's all about bomb defusal map changes this update, with Ancient, Grind, Cache, and Mocha getting a bunch of tweaks, plus there are a few general gameplay adjustments in the mix, too. Starting with Operation Broken Fang's Ancient map, it sounds like Valve has given its visuals a pretty good going-over. The studio's done an \"art revision\" on bombsite B and the area around it, and also increased base textures' contrast at the site for \"better player needs\". Plywood throughout the entire map has been recoloured to create a better contrast, and the spawn point placement for both teams has been \"tweaked\", Valve says, among other changes. Meanwhile, Grind has seen more gameplay-focussed adjustments, with its lurk positions in mid getting reduced for \"more fluid rotations\", and the cover on A short has been lowered to enable boosting over smokes (though some other \"unintended\" boost spots have been got rid of). Cache has got some performance optimisations and other visual and sound changes (the sky is brighter and the birds quieter now), while Mocha has got some extra bombsite markers, bug fixes, and clipping and navigation mesh improvements. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-patch-ancient-cache-map-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/cobblestone-map-retro\">A CS:GO modder has taken Cobblestone back to its roots</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-communication\">Valve explains why it never tells CS:GO players anything</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-chickens\">CS:GO patch gives chickens \"a visual upgrade\"</a> ",

While aim and skill mean everything in a <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">competitive first-person shooter</a> like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, having the flashiest skin on your weapon comes at a close second. As a game that has been around for nearly a decade, CS:GO totes hundreds of skins for the nearly 60 weapons available in the game. CS:GO skins are received organically, and randomly, from weapon cases or mission rewards. These cases can only be opened with keys purchased at $2.50 (£1.79). The more popular way of guaranteeing the purchase of skins though is through the Steam Marketplace. Players that have received CS:GO skins from <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cases\">CS:GO cases</a> can sell them on the marketplace and users can buy them outright without risking drop probability. The combination of popularity and supply and demand have made skins an actual form of currency in the CS:GO ecosystem. The <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/most-expensive-skins\">most expensive CS:GO skin</a> available right now, for example, is the Souvenir Dragon Lore AWP in Factory New condition which will set you back $26,000 (£18,280). <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/best-skins\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/how-to-show-fps\">How to show FPS in CS:GO</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/moan-bind\">CS:GO moan bind: how to set up a player radio moan keybind</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cheats\">CS:GO cheats: how to spot a cheater</a> ",

Since then, the bomb defusal map has seen some pretty significant changes across various updates, which means the version you'll play now is a pretty different experience to earlier iterations.

That's by design, as devs behind these games have now explained that their policy is to \"let updates do the talking\". \"We think CS:GO is better when we get clear, unfiltered customer feedback,\" CS:GO developer Gautam Babbar explains in a dev-focused talk. \"We read and analyze this feedback our customers post on various online communities. But as they know, we rarely participate in those conversations. When we participate, they stop talking to each other and they start talking to us, and the feedback becomes less clear. Occasionally we weigh in if they seem blocked, or we need some more information, but otherwise we just stay out of it.\" When CS:GO players have something to say, it's because they're unhappy with the state of the game - thus, Babbar argues, the best way to respond to that feedback is by fixing whatever bug or problem players are upset about. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-communication\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-chickens\">CS:GO patch gives chickens \"a visual upgrade\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-360-stats\">CS:GO gets paid stat tracking</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/broken-fang-end-date\">Now's your last chance to play CS:GO Operation Broken Fang</a> ",

While CSGO is the prettier, more polished version of the same set of ideas, so many of the maps, so much of the <em>feel</em> that I loved, isn't present in the latest iteration. The original Counter-Strike is still available to play, but its final update, 1.6, isn't the version I want either. I want beta 5.2, or thereabouts, from back before Valve bought the game and its rougher edges got sanded away. That's me. But I'm here to ask you: what live service game would you like to see relaunch and preserve an older version of itself, as World Of Warcraft: Classic has?

But that's just the actual stuff. The important stuff. I'm here for the fun stuff, which is improved chickens. Yes, the chickens have gotten an upgrade. The <a href=\"https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2021/05/34020/\">patch notes</a> simply say that \"chicken models have received a visual upgrade\". There are five colours of chicken - black, white, black with a white head, brown, and white with a brown head - but, distressingly, the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/n4k89g/when_you_kill_the_new_chickens_the_feathers_will/\">community has discovered</a> that they all leave behind the same colour of feather when killed. No word yet from Valve on when this game-breaking issue will be rectified. Chickens have been the subject of a number of easter eggs from the CS:GO devs over the years, including special costume changes to coincide with various holiday updates. Here's hoping there continue to be some updates that might give the new chickens new reasons to celebrate. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-chickens\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-communication\">Valve explains why it never tells CS:GO players anything</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-360-stats\">CS:GO gets paid stat tracking</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/broken-fang-end-date\">Now's your last chance to play CS:GO Operation Broken Fang</a> ",

Although the exploit - one of several vulnerabilities reported to Valve by Secret Club members - had the potential to affect any game utilising Source Engine, The Secret Club stressed only CS:GO was still verifiably at risk. \"We cannot say for sure if and when things have been patched in other games throughout the time without us being notified about it,\" it wrote. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-19-valve-finally-fixes-cs-go-exploit-that-could-give-hackers-control-of-pcs\">Read more</a> ",

Crafted by its original creator Colin 'Brute' Volrath and popular community map <a href=\"https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby\">Ruby</a>'s creator Catfood, the all-new Tuscan is still very much a work-in-progress, and so far we've only got a peep at it via a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nors3/status/1309535039621926912\">few tweets</a> and a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4j0g1VLlDl4\">guided walkthrough clip</a>. Now, however, it's come to the CS:GO Steam Workshop. Posted by Catfood on Steam Workshop, the new CS:GO version of Tuscan is tagged as 'WIP', and from the images included it's clear there's still a ways to go before it'll be a fully polished and complete map. Many of the floor, wall, and object textures aren't finished just yet - but, enough of the map is in place that we can get a really good idea of what the real deal will be when it arrives. Compared to the original version - and an older creation from 2015 still available on <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312199550\">Steam Workshop</a> - the latest remake is a much brighter map, with pastel-coloured buildings and plenty of sunshine beaming down onto it from a blue sky. It's aesthetically really appealing, with more intricate stonework walls and buildings this time around. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-tuscan-map\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-bureau-office\">This fan-made CS:GO mod reworks classic map Office with a modern spin</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/match-fixing-fbi\">CS:GO pros in North America being investigated by FBI for match fixing</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-guitar-mod\">A CS:GO fan has created a STALKER-style playable guitar</a> ",

As part of the celebrations, Virtus.pro recalls that following the MLG Major Championship: Columbus in 2016, Valve began releasing money to teams that was generated by the sale of team-branded weapon stickers within the game. While team owners across CS:GO esports would be awaiting the money with open arms, Valve's wording on its payment to Virtus.pro almost landed the organisation in hot water. According to Anton Chereppenikov, the CEO and owner of ESforce, the group that owns Virtus.pro, \"the employees of the Lithuanian bank with which we cooperated with at the time were shocked and frightened\" after Valve's bank transfer was worded simply as \"weapon sticker sales\". <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/virtus-pro-2016-terrorist-group-mistake\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/astralis-future-dev1ce\">Kasper Hvidt on dev1ce's Astralis departure: \"No team depends on just one person\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/nip-astralis-dev1ce\">Ninjas in Pyjamas sign dev1ce on a three-year CS:GO contract</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> ",

These guidelines had not seen an update since the game was new and all CS:GO VAC bans were relatively recent. But VAC bans can now be more than 8 years old. So we’ve decided to update them. Moving forward, a VAC ban will only disqualify a player from an event if it was either received less than 5 years prior, or if it was received at any time after their first participation in a Valve-sponsored event (e.g., after participating in a qualifier for an RMR event). Note that VAC bans stay in place with all of their other effects; the only change is how they influence your eligibility to play in Valve-sponsored events. There are other reasons a player may not be eligible to participate in Valve-sponsored events. These remain unchanged. We hope you’re as excited as we are for the upcoming 2021 RMR events.

It is not the only factor in one-tapping your way to glory, as things like your sensitivity, DPI settings, and even the refresh rate on your monitor can all be major contributors to your aim as a whole. However, investing the time into finding the best CS:GO crosshair that suits your personal playstyle is worth the effort. When you first start playing CS:GO, the default CS:GO crosshair is a dynamic hulking neon yellow beast which may suit casual players or those just getting to grips with the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">competitive FPS game</a> just fine. However, as you look to improve your own performance and work your way through the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/ranks\">CS:GO ranks</a>, a custom CS:GO crosshair becomes a must-have. Are you someone who likes to frag across the map? You're more likely to have a wider crosshair with a central dot, whereas an entry fragger playing up close is better suited to a tighter crosshair with thicker outlines. To get you started, here's everything you need to know about CS:GO crosshairs, including how to set one up, what settings you'll need to pay attention to, and what some of the top professionals use. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/crosshair-settings\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/best-competitive-fps-games\">The 10 best competitive FPS games July 2023</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/s1mple-settings\">s1mple settings, crosshair, and config for CS:GO</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/ranks\">CS:GO ranks - the ranking system and MMR explained</a> ",

In a statement, Fnatic's head coach Andreas Samuelsson describes flusha as \"one of the smartest and most iconic players in CS:GO history.\" Following Fnatic's announcement, flusha <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flusha/status/1381637423004803079?s=20\">revealed his next steps.</a> The veteran will be forming a new roster, featuring some well-known names that are all currently looking for a new home. They are Miikka 'suNny' Kemppi, Jere '⁠sergej⁠' Salo (both previously ENCE), Rokas 'EspiranTo⁠' Milasauskas (previously c0ntact) and Buğra '⁠Calyx' Arkin (previously Envy). <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/flusha-leaves-fnatic\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/astralis-future-dev1ce\">Kasper Hvidt on dev1ce's Astralis departure: \"No team depends on just one person\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/nip-astralis-dev1ce\">Ninjas in Pyjamas sign dev1ce on a three-year CS:GO contract</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a> ",

The 31-year-old Frenchman, who has been playing competitive Counter-Strike since the late 2000s, will be leaving the active roster after the tournament, which gets underway tomorrow and concludes on April 18. The experienced rifler has been with Vitality since it first entered the CS:GO scene in 2018, and has also represented big names such as G2 and Team Envy. In a tweet following Vitality's announcement, RpK says he will \"give it his best for the boys\" in his final competition for the team, which has recently been on a run of poor results.

If you hover over the guitarist and hit your action button, the camera will shift and you'll get to take control of the tunes yourself. The way it works is via a pop-up command wheel, which has six different chords. Using mouse and keyboard controls, you can then put a a little diity together.

A new creation that stands out is a weapon skin line that takes inspiration from one of CS:GO's maps and the lore behind it, telling stories through the skins themselves. CS:GO fan and creator Cimota has posted a preview reel (below) of their \"Tales of Cedar Creek collection\" on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/mdampv/de_nuke_self_created_lore_inspired_series_tales/\">Reddit</a>, which is a set of weapon skins for a handful of rifles inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> Nuke bomb defusal map. The first, called 'Project Cedar, is an icy grey-blue skin \"based around a board meeting; notes found within the map, how the nuclear reactor is made, possible cost reductions,\" and, er, \"too many chickens\". You can see notes discovered as part of the story scrawled onto the weapon skin, including one of those pesky chickens in purple. The story progresses into the next skin - Cedar's Decay - which, suitably, shows the weapon descending into a decayed state, with a rust-like coating creeping up its barrel. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-nuke-skins\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-fall-guys\">CS:GO fans turn the classic FPS game into Fall Guys with skins and \"30 minigames\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-hades-music-kit\">CS:GO devs are giving away a Hades music kit to the RPG's Steam players</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-broken-fang-missions-week-16\">Here are this week's CS:GO Broken Fang missions</a> ",

And yet, one creative CS:GO fan has created a stupendous mash-up of the two, with a fan map that essentially turns the shooter into a beany bonanza. Made by creators Teteu and Enrico_srp4, the 'MG_Fallling_Guy' CS:GO fan map is, even at first glance, everything that Fall Guys is. Snapshots of the map in action on its Steam Workshop page showcase the same vividly coloured platforms peppered with zany obstacles that fill the battle royale, with blue skies and fluffy clouds beyond. And, of course, there are those distinctive bean costumes included, which are lined up ready for players to hop into. The creators say that the map includes 30 minigames to pick from, or you can opt for a random selection via its 'quick play' feature. There aren't details giving us a rundown of what these are, exactly, but from the attached images it looks like there obstacle courses with features like levitating platforms, Fall Guys' infamous spinning level contraption, mazes, and other similar things. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-fall-guys\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-hades-music-kit\">CS:GO devs are giving away a Hades music kit to the RPG's Steam players</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-broken-fang-missions-week-16\">Here are this week's CS:GO Broken Fang missions</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-inferno-rainbow-six-siege\">This CS:GO fan map adds Rainbow Six Siege-like destruction to Inferno</a> ",

As reported by <a href=\"https://www.ginx.tv/en/cs-go/cs-go-broken-fang-week-16-missions-complete-lasting-impression\">Ginx.tv</a>, the CS:GO Operation Broken Fang week 16 set of missions is called 'Ancient Danger', with the headline one called 'A Lasting Impression' - the op's next co-op story mission. Its description is pretty cryptic in the in-game menu - \"<em>...the retina quickly adapts to the bright stimulus, creating temporary blindness</em>\" - and it's a two-star mission that doesn't appear to be too long, but features a few nifty elements to complete if you're keen to scoop up all there is on offer. YouTuber JustBogdy has posted a clip showing with pointers on this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l1al4LA34rI\">here</a>. As for the other four missions, the first on the list is called 'Just Scratching the Surface', which asks you to \"win rounds in Competitive: Ancient\" (with one star per seven, 15, and 20 each on offer). The second - which has the Indiana Jones-inspired title, 'That belongs in a museum!' - asks you to \"get 25 UMP-45 kills in Guardian: Ancient\".

The French organisation has been championing a six-man roster since, freely rotating players in and out of the starting lineup. However, early in 2021, Valve ruled that teams who substituted players during official Regional Major Ranking competitions would face punishment. While third-parties like BLAST have continued to let Vitality rotate its team, it has now decided to drop its resident sixth man, Nabil 'Nivera' Benrlitom, as it gears up for a number of competitions offering RMR points. In a statement, Vitality thanks Nivera for being part of its \"ambitious\" six-man team and for helping it secure two big titles at the tail end of 2020. It also states that it is \"firmly convinced\" six-man rosters are the best way to help grow the competitive CS:GO scene, but has been forced to drop Nivera because of Valve's decision. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/vitality-drops-nivera\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/ranks\">CS:GO ranks explained: How to get your first rank, rank distribution, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/g2-drops-kennys\">G2 Esports drops kennyS from its active CS:GO roster</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/update-ping-hidden-enemies-fix\">CS:GO pings will no longer reveal hidden enemies</a> ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> is usually the most popular game on Steam. For a few bizarre hours last night, it was no longer available on Steam. CS:GO, and a seemingly random assortment of other Steam titles briefly disappeared from the store, and nobody seems to know why. Valve has acknowledged that it happened, but hasn't provided any details on why. At around midnight in the US on March 9, CS:GO was removed from the Steam store. A couple of games like, er, Paws and Claws: Pet Vet and Section 8: Prejudice were removed at the same time, as were DLC packs for everything from Fallout: New Vegas to Black Desert Online. A handful of movies and shows were removed as well, including Mad Max, Clerks, and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Truly a dark time for our culture. As you can see on <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/?long_history\">SteamDB</a>, every title disappeared at once, and then they were all restored a little over two hours later. There was <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/730/graphs/\">no apparent drop-off</a> in CS:GO players during that period, so it looks like this just affected the store page - not the game itself. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-steam-removed\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/mod-prodigy-de-port\">Prepare for heavy Counter-Strike nostalgia with this Prodigy map port</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dnd-open-world-game\">D&D gets a \"triple-A, third-person, open-world\" RPG from CS:GO co-devs</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/map-danger-zone-county\">This fan-made CS:GO map looks like it was plucked out of Far Cry 5</a> ",

It's practically already done. We expect to be releasing the CS:GO VR mode in about eight or nine years.\" Valve has already identified potential pitfalls with the new format, Walker explains. \"One of the challenges we faced when developing CS:GO VR was the movement.

Some form of Prodigy has appeared in every version of Counter-Strike since Beta 4.0, until it was dropped in <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>. Now it's back, thanks to some fastidious map modders. Prodigy was originally created by Alexander 'Hobbit' Manilov, and he started work on the level that would become de_prodigy the same night he was first introduced to Counter-Strike at a LAN party. The map features two bomb locations and is set in a mountain military base of some kind. Terrorists must bomb either the computer lab or a fuel pipeline control room, and the level is a sometimes confusing jumble of corridors and rooms. The port you can now find on the Steam Workshop is based on the improved version of Prodigy introduced in Counter-Strike 1.6, after Manilov joined Gearbox Software to help work on Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Modder just sid says this port is almost identical to the 1.6 version, with some minor changes and lighting adjustments. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/mod-prodigy-de-port\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dnd-open-world-game\">D&D gets a \"triple-A, third-person, open-world\" RPG from CS:GO co-devs</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/map-danger-zone-county\">This fan-made CS:GO map looks like it was plucked out of Far Cry 5</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-real-madrid-casemiro\">CS:GO makes a Real Madrid player a lot more nervous than football</a> ",

Among many new fan-made maps posted this week is one impressive option that drops you into a portion of rural America called 'Grizzly County', with all the landmarks and scenery that idea conjures up - kind of like Far Cry 5's Hope County. Created by CS:GO modders Lizard and Jakuza, the 'County - Danger Zone' custom map is - as its name implies - crafted for the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-battle-royale-game\">battle royale game</a> mode, Danger Zone. Set in a fictional slice of rural USA, the map features locations like a farm, sawmill, various homes, a carpenter gothic-style church, quarry, trailer park, motel, police station, and - from the images on the mod's page - what looks like a big, creepy, dilapidated house with suitably spooky interiors. A bird's-eye view of the map gives some sense of its pretty huge scale, and everything looks not only the part, but incredibly detailed. There are big outdoor spaces surrounded by trees and mountains in the distance, and the variety of its layout looks like it would make an awesome spot for a good few rounds of Danger Zone. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/map-danger-zone-county\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-real-madrid-casemiro\">CS:GO makes a Real Madrid player a lot more nervous than football</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-ping-changes\">CS:GO update fixes ping bug, so you now can't \"reveal a hidden enemy\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/aztec-map-rework\">CS:GO fan gives the FPS game's Aztec map an impressive \"Ancient-style\" rework</a> ",

Creator and CS:GO fan Henge has posted a new mod that reworks the Aztec bomb defusal map to give it an \"Ancient-style\" design. \"Here is de_aztec in Ancient style,\" the modder says, explaining: \"I wanted to give the Aztec veterans a chance to play their loved map in a new beauty design.\" As you can see in the before-and-after-style clip below, the transformation is pretty incredible. The blueprint of Aztec is still very much there, and it doesn't look like fans of the map will find it especially different to navigate - but, its whole aesthetic is given a new flavour, styled after the map introduced in last year's <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-operation-broken-fang\">CS:GO Operation Broken Fang</a>. The map's brickwork is chunkier, more ornate, and given a more realistic, ramshackle look (well, they are ruins of an ancient site, after all).

The Dane, who played for FaZe for more than two years between 2016 and 2018, is now back with the team following the retirement of Olof 'olofmeister' Kajbjer. During his first stint with FaZe, karrigan helped guide the organisation to a number of big tournament wins, such as an ELEAGUE Premier title in 2017 and EPICENTER 2018. Despite now being 30 years old, the rifler has still managed to stick to his winning ways during his time at mousesports, which included winning Season 10 of the ESL Pro League. During his decorated career, which has seen him represent other big name organisations such as TSM, Astralis, and Fnatic, karrigan has won over $1 million in tournament prize money. While many older CS:GO pros have looked for a fresh start in esports by switching over to Valorant, karrigan still looks in prime shape to keep competing at the highest level and is clearly keen to bring even more titles to FaZe. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/csgo-veteran-karrigan-returns-to-faze-clan\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/update-ping-hidden-enemies-fix\">CS:GO pings will no longer reveal hidden enemies</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/guardian-free-agent\">CS:GO veteran GuardiaN confirms free agency</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/vitality-apex-break\">Vitality's IGL apEX to take a break from CS:GO due to \"personal problems\"</a> ",

Now, another community treat has caught our eye, in the form of a neat new hide-and-seek map. Simply called 'Hide-and-Seek House', modder S224's new community creation sees you and some CS:GO-loving buddies head into a house - a little reminiscent in places of a GTA V Vinewood-style pad - for a good few rounds of, well, hiding and seeking. \"There are lots of cool hideouts and passages on the map,\" the creator says, adding that they \"tried to make every element on the map perfectly finished the way I wanted\". Oh, and they tease that there's \"one interesting place worth seeing\" in it. Hmm. As you can see in the preview clip below, from the outside the place looks like a regular - if relatively swish - residential pad, with gardens, a garage, (empty) pool, and even a jungle gym. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-hide-and-seek\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-skins-bloodsport\">Five years on, CS:GO fan completes the popular 'Bloodsport' weapon skin line</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-custom-training-map\">New fan-made CS:GO training map helps you nail your aim and movement</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/cheats-shroud\">Shroud prefers Valorant to CSGO because of a lack of cheaters</a> ",

Between his first and second stints with Na'Vi, GuardiaN represented FaZe Clan, winning a number of big events such as ELEAGUE Premier and ESL One New York in 2017 and EPICENTER in 2018. However, he could only land just a four-month stint on Na'Vi's roster before sitting on the sidelines for what has now been over a year.

As you can see in the preview clip below, creator Dreazc0v's new DC Aim and Movement training map for CS:GO is based in an indoor, warehouse-like location. It has several different areas and features designed to help players hone some of the skills needed to gain an edge in the live game, such an open-plan arena in which it appears you can spawn bots that'll hunt you down from all directions. Minimal barriers between you and them (just a few crates) mean you'll have to keep your aim sharp to nab them before they nab you. There are also target firing ranges, which it seems you can move up and down their tracks, giving you practice at various ranges, and with adjustable speeds. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-custom-training-map\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/cheats-shroud\">Shroud prefers Valorant to CSGO because of a lack of cheaters</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-shorthanded-loser-income\">CSGO will now compensate you for shorthanded losing streaks in Competitive and Wingman</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/bans-betting\">35 CSGO players banned by ESIC for betting related violations</a> ",

That means that now and again someone will hop into his chat and ask the hugely popular streamer if he fancies giving Valve's shooter another go. It happened again recently, and Shroud took the opportunity to reflect on the state of the game. He was playing Valorant at the time, which is essentially Riot's take on CSGO, so uses that as a point of comparison. \"I'd love to play CSGO if it was good,\" he says. \"The beauty of Valorant is its accessibility. You jump in, you play, you're confident, and you play your one or two games, have a good time or have a bad time, but at least you know you're not going to get cheated.\" Shroud then explains that most casual games of CSGO he plays reportedly involve someone using aimbot, sprintbot, wall hacks, or generally just teleporting about the place. Even before Valorant came on the scene, Riot was highlighting the competitive game's <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/valorant/anti-cheat-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanguard anti-cheat</a> system.

        "contents": "Like with any competitive multiplayer game, there's a big market for cheats in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Valve's timeless first-person shooter has an incredibly high skill ceiling, and some players will resort to using CS:GO cheats or hacks to make their way to the elusive rank of Global Elite. It can be tempting to cheat when you're constantly dying to better players, but doing so can lead to some pretty bad repercussions. If you value your Steam account and the ability of playing online multiplayer games with friends, you might want to reconsider. With permanent <a href=\"/csgo\">CS:GO</a> bans and VAC bans on the line, the risks seriously outweigh the benefits of downloading a dodgy script you found online. Nevertheless the world of cheating in games, and more specifically in CS:GO is fascinating, and we don't blame you if it's piqued your interest. So, without further ado, here's everything you need to know about <strong>CS:GO cheats</strong>, how to catch a cheater, and what punishments they may face. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cheats\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cheapest-knife\">The cheapest CS:GO knives in 2023</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/ranks\">CS:GO ranks - the ranking system and MMR explained</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/surf\">How to surf in CS:GO</a> ",

So, if you're a team member down against your opponents for several rounds on the trot and then score a loss, you'll receive some in-game cash. \"In Competitive and Wingman, if your team has fewer players than the opposing team for three or more consecutive rounds in the half, each of your team members will receive a $1000 'Shorthanded Loser Income' following a round loss,\" Valve explains in the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> January 27 patch notes. It's worth noting, though, that this won't apply in situations where a teammate was kicked from a match. So, while tackling opponents while a teammate down can be a frustrating task, this gameplay change should take the sting out of a losing streak in the two modes. Additionally, the game's update adds a new \"technical timeout\" feature to the two modes - which is different to its existing tactical timeouts option. As Valve explains, this means each team gets a two minute technical timeout, which gets initiated automatically when a teammate disconnects for the first time in a match. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-shorthanded-loser-income\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/bans-betting\">35 CSGO players banned by ESIC for betting related violations</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-patch-apollo-map-changes\">CSGO update makes a bunch of Apollo map changes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-aim-map-procedurally-generated\">CSGO fan creates procedurally generated aim map with \"tens of millions\" of variations</a> ",

In an update posted to the official <a href=\"https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2021/01/32375/\">CS:GO blog</a>, Valve has ruled that those found exploiting the bug will be banned from attending Majors in the future. Valve uses a scaling table to show how this will be put into effect, but in short, coaches found to have two ESIC demerit points will be banned from one Major, coaches with three demerits will be banned from two Majors, and so on and so forth to six demerit points. It's currently unknown which coaches are set to miss out just yet though, but those with six points will be barred from <em>all </em>future Majors. In addition to the sanctions, Valve has also made some pretty big changes to the way coaches can communicate with their players during online Regional Major Ranking matches. Now, coaching staff will no longer be able to work with players during qualifying matches. This means coaches won't be allowed in the same room as players or on the same server. They also won't be allowed to communicate with their players at all during the course of the match. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/rmr-reset-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/teams/north/shuts-down\">North esports organisation to be shut down</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/esport-denmark-elderly-people-stay-connected\">Esport Denmark is using esports to help elderly people stay connected</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/blast-premier/coaching-rule-spring-groups\">BLAST will not implement CS:GO coaching changes despite Valve ruling</a> ",

Ultimately there would be no Major in 2020, but it is important that fans have an opportunity to celebrate and recognize the hard work of the best teams of 2020. So we’re excited to announce 2020 CS:GO RMR Capsules. These capsules represent the teams that would have received invitations to the 2020 Fall Major, broken down by their invitation status (Legend, Challenger, Contender). You can find the final RMR scores and standings here. For these stickers, 50% of the proceeds directly support the teams. 2021 RMR Events We will continue to hold regional RMR events to identify the 24 teams to invite to the 2021 PGL Stockholm Major. In the link below you can find all the details and updates to the 2021 RMR event system, but here are some highlights: RMR points are reset for 2021, however the 2020 RMR Legends will start with 600, Challengers with 300, and contenders with 100 points. Teams can now specify a substitute player (any player who is not registered to participate or substitute for another team) that is separate from their coach. A team incurs a penalty when they substitute out a player in an event, but there is no penalty when that player is brought back in. During online matches only players are allowed in the room and on the server. Neither coaches nor any other team staff will be allowed in the room, on the server, or to otherwise communicate with the team during an online match. The full details of the 2021 RMR system can be found here. Coaching Integrity In September of 2020 we were alerted to the fact that many professional coaches were exploiting a coaching-feature bug to gain an unfair advantage during matches. You can read about our initial response here. Since then, ESIC has published the findings of their investigation and the resulting sanctions. You can read about them here. As our follow up, we have decided that coaches that exploited the camera bug will be ineligible to participate in some number of future Valve-sponsored events–that number to be determined by the extent of the abuse. The following table translates ESIC demerits into Major ineligibility: ESIC Demerits — Number of Majors to Miss 2 Demerits — 1 Event 3 Demerits — 2 Events 4 Demerits — 3 Events 5 Demerits — 5 Events 6+ Demerits — All Events In addition to consequences for individuals, we have also thought about how commonly coaches exploited the bug, for how long it went unreported, as well as how common coach stream-sniping accusations have been. To avoid the diminished integrity of coaching from casting a shadow on the integrity of Valve-sponsored events, we’ll be changing the restrictions on support staff in the following way: During online matches only players are allowed in the room and on the server. Neither coaches nor any other team staff will be allowed in the room, on the server, or to otherwise communicate with the team during an online match. Finally, today's Release Notes can be found here.",

The BLAST Premier is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/biggest-esports-tournaments\">biggest esports tournaments</a>, but ESIC's assessment of the footage \"does not suggest that the players were given information derived from the stream or that they gained any advantage in their matches\".

Vitality's management has accepted responsibility for the error, with CEO Nicolas Maurer saying that \"Even though this is not coming from a malicious intention, we agree that this placement is controversial. This is a big mistake on our side and we accept the fine.\" Both the team and BLAST Premier commissioner Andrew Haworth acknowledge that as soon as the team was made aware of the stream playing behind its players, someone immediately turned off the screen.

For several it's their second offence in the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game</a>, and the punishments include bans of up to five years. The Esports Integrity Commission <a href=\"https://esic.gg/the-esports-integrity-commission-issues-sanctions-against-35-individuals-for-betting-offences-in-violation-of-the-esic-anti-corruption-code/\">issued a report on the sanctions Friday</a>, breaking down the investigation, infractions, and subsequent actions taken. Coming from the Australian, North American, and European regions, 35 players have been deemed to have committed some infraction of the Anti-Corruption Code, meaning they bet on matches featuring ESIC members, bet on a specific individuals matches within the ESIC, or bet against someone's matches within the ESIC. Five levels of punishment are given, severity ranging from betting within the ESIC, landing a one year ban, to betting against a single team for 10 or more matches, earning the offender a hefty five years instead. Two previous offenders had their bans increased after evidence of further infringement came to light; Akram 'ADK' Smida, formerly of Rooster, who now has a two year ban instead of one, and Darly 'Mayker' May, formerly of Ground Zero, had his one year upped to three. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/bans-betting\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-patch-apollo-map-changes\">CSGO update makes a bunch of Apollo map changes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-aim-map-procedurally-generated\">CSGO fan creates procedurally generated aim map with \"tens of millions\" of variations</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update\">CS:GO update - the latest changes to the world's best FPS</a> ",

According to the investigation, there were numerous forms of betting behaviour present which violate the Anti-Corruption Code, such as players betting on their own team to either win or lose matches, and more generally \"betting on matches in ESIC member events\". These players now face bans from ESIC member events - the organisers of which include ESL, DreamHack, and a host of others - for up to five years.

The latest patch, though, notably adds a bunch of tweaks to CS:GO's Apollo map, including a fix for some hiccups caused by the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> most recent update. It's not detailed in the new CS:GO update notes what these issues were, exactly, but it's always good to see troubles introduced get picked up and ironed out quickly (the latest patch having gone live a fortnight back). Other changes to the fan-made hostage rescue map, which features in CS:GO's recent expansion <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-operation-broken-fang\">Operation Broken Fang</a>, include making glass breaking \"more consistent\", replacing and realigning some textures that weren't quite right, and deleting an \"upsetting bench\". Additionally, the update's Apollo fixes include fixing \"some gun stuck spots\" and boost spots, removing cans that some players mistook for smoke grenades, reducing assets in giftspot, and - finally - \"other general optimisations for lower end computers\". <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-patch-apollo-map-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/bans-betting\">35 CSGO players banned by ESIC for betting related violations</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-aim-map-procedurally-generated\">CSGO fan creates procedurally generated aim map with \"tens of millions\" of variations</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update\">CS:GO update - the latest changes to the world's best FPS</a> ",

Occasionally, however, something really impressive hits the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters\">FPS game's</a> workshop, such as a new custom Inferno aim map that works in procedural generation - meaning, there are \"tens of millions\" of map variations, according to its maker. Orel's 'Aim Rogue Inferno' procedurally generated map offers a new layout each round, made up of elements in the style of CS:GO's Inferno map. According to a clip showcasing the map (below), it includes three types of map generation - symmetrical, half-symmetrical, and non-symmetrical - as well as support for custom seeds, full customisability, and map variations into the tens of millions. To give it a go, the creator explains on the map's Steam workshop page, all you have to do is walk into a 'start' area and wait for the map generation to do its thing. As you can see in the clip, it looks like the map isn't huge in scale - but it's pretty huge in scope. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-aim-map-procedurally-generated\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-patch-apollo-map-changes\">CSGO update makes a bunch of Apollo map changes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update\">CS:GO update - the latest changes to the world's best FPS</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-mirage-map-remake\">A CSGO fan has remade part of its Mirage map and it looks gorgeous</a> ",

With the pandemic cancelling 2020's planned majors and casting doubt on whether we'd get one this year at all, PGL has now announced that it will be hosting a CS:GO major in Stockholm, Sweden, between October 23 and November 7, 2021. This will be the first CS:GO major since the StarLadder Berlin tournament which concluded in September 2019. By the time PGL Stockholm comes around, fans will have waited over two years to see a top-tier CS:GO tournament. The good news doesn't end, as PGL also reveals the Stockholm major will boast the largest prize pool ever seen for a CS:GO event at $2 million.

CS:GO fan Dooodaaad has reimagined the 'B short' portion the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> Mirage map, and it looks pretty incredible. \"While we wait for Valve to remake Mirage, I figured I'd give it a try,\" the creator says. \"Here's what I did with catwalk!\" As you can see in some before-and-after comparison shots they've <a href=\"https://imgsli.com/MzczNzM\">posted on Imgur here</a>, the difference is pretty astonishing. The previously minimalist street scene has been partially remodelled, with the building corner in the section's centre turned into a rustic brick shelter with decorative awning, hanging plant, and café table with chairs. There's also a scooter tucked away in the shadows. As for the building ahead, its previously bare façade has been given a bit of an overhaul, with decorative new windows that look like those seen in Dust 2 and a gate entrance. While it looks very different from live Mirage, the creator says they \"remade the basic geometry from the original level exactly,\" but \"just decorated it differently\". <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-mirage-map-remake\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update\">CS:GO update - the latest changes to the world's best FPS</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update-bots-competitive\">CSGO update removes bots from competitive and wingman modes</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-operation-broken-fang\">CS:GO Operation Broken Fang is now live</a> ",

Prior to the 7th January update, when a CS:GO player disconnected or was kicked they were replaced by a bot to keep teams even. Following the update, players who disconnect or are kicked in classic competitive and wingman modes will no longer be replaced by a bot. This means there is no more 5v5 if a player leaves - teams will always be a player down. If the the entire other team leaves, one bot will be left on the other team, idling in spawn. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-09-counter-strike-global-offensive-players-wave-goodbye-to-bots-by-remembering-them-at-their-best\">Read more</a> ",

Traditionally if a player left or was kicked from a game, they would be replaced with a bot. These bots, if you could stop them from rushing B with their freshly purchased Negev, could be controlled by a player upon their death. This led to some four-man stacks kicking their solo queue teammates to take full control of the game. This will no longer be the case anymore, though.

The Frenchman, who turned 20 years old last month, has been an integral part of Vitality's climb to the top of the HLTV World Rankings and largely successful second half of 2020. Vitality has been the dominant force in the BLAST Premier Fall Series and won the Intel Extreme Masters XV Beijing event. While it couldn't end the season in winning fashion at the IEM XV Global Challenge, the news that ZywOo is now tied down for the next four years will be reason to celebrate for Vitality fans. To celebrate the star AWPer's new long-term contract, Vitality plastered his face across its home city of Paris by projecting holograms onto landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Pantheon <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/zywoo-new-vitality-contract-2020\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/kassad-leaves-cloud9\">CS:GO coach kassad parts ways with Cloud9</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/teams/astralis/jakob-lund-kristensen-interview\">Jakob Lund Kristensen on Astralis' growth: \"we thought we were better than everyone else\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/neymar-zywoo-clutch\">Neymar clutches up in CS:GO against Vitality pros ZywOo and shox</a> ",

He broke the news while being interviewed after the culmination of the Intel Extreme Masters Season XV Global Challenge, which Team Liquid came runner-up in. Twistzz, 21, joined Team Liquid in 2017 and has enjoyed much success in his three and a half years playing Counter-Strike with the team. He helped the organisation win eight major CS:GO tournaments, including the one million dollar Intel Grand Slam Season 2 prize for being the first team to win four out of ten S-Tier tournaments in a season. Team Liquid lost 3-0 to Astralis in the final this time around, but it's Twistzz's announcement that has stolen the headlines. \"I've enjoyed all the support over the years,\" he says in the post-match interview. \"The org's been nothing but family to me, and I hope that I'm back next year in a new home.\" <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/twistzz-leaving-team-liquid\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/kassad-leaves-cloud9\">CS:GO coach kassad parts ways with Cloud9</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/teams/astralis/jakob-lund-kristensen-interview\">Jakob Lund Kristensen on Astralis' growth: \"we thought we were better than everyone else\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/neymar-zywoo-clutch\">Neymar clutches up in CS:GO against Vitality pros ZywOo and shox</a> ",

Having been involved with the scene for well over a decade, he started out working lower-level jobs in the industry before founding the Copenhagen Wolves in 2012. Once the Wolves disbanded in 2016, Kristensen founded Astralis, BLAST, and most recently, Astralis Group, which brought together Astralis' various brands and titles. He's witnessed the esports ecosystem grow from infancy to its current state. Most famous for their catalogue of Counter-Strike:Global Offensive successes, Astralis is a household name in the world of competitive gaming. However, the organisation has also set benchmarks in the often overlooked commercial side of esports, becoming one of the first publicly listed esports teams in late 2019, as well as expanding into League of Legends and FIFA in recent years before bringing their teams together under the Astralis banner in 2020. It's perhaps characteristic of its success that these milestones occurred close to a year of economic and logistical turbulence. So how does Astralis go about navigating the esports landscape? And what does the future hold for an industry that continues to strive towards profitability?

The European organisation has decided to keep Frenchman François 'AmaNEk' Delaunay after the 27-year-old impressed during stages of the BLAST Premier Fall Series and at the DreamHack Masters Winter. The decision now means countryman and fellow Counter-Strike veteran Audric 'JaCkz' Jug is benched. G2 confirms in a statement that JaCkz is still contracted to G2 but is allowed to explore other options. JaCkz was given his opportunity to fight for a spot on the roster during the IEM Beijing-Haidan tournament, at which G2 finished in the top four. Despite the decent finish, team manager Jérôme 'NiaK' Sudries says in <a href=\"https://g2esports.com/2020/12/07/csgo_update_12_2020/\">a statement</a> that G2 \"quickly realised that our system benefited more from qualities.\" JaCkz has represented G2 for two years after joining from 3DMAX in November 2018. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/g2-drops-jackz\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/teams/astralis/talent-team-roster-2021\">Astralis confirms its 2021 CS:GO and League of Legends Talent team rosters</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/blast-premier-teams-csppa-clash\">CS:GO teams clash with CSPPA over BLAST Premier player protests</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/spring-2021-major-cancelled\">CS:GO major in spring 2021 reportedly cancelled by Valve</a> ",

The latest to double down on this is Ninjas in Pyjamas, with the historic organisation launching a new talent program to help preserve Sweden's status as a top breeding ground for Counter-Strike pros. Path to Ninja sees NiP partner up with Area Academy, which has hosted regional Svenska Elitserien CS:GO events since 2018. The talent program will see a judging panel pick \"two or three\" of the top performers from Elitserien events and \"provide them with all the tools they need, both inside and outside the game, to lower the gap between grassroots and professional CS:GO.\" The panel is composed of four former Counter-Strike 1.6 professionals, including Ninjas in Pyjamas' current head CS:GO coach Björn 'THREAT' Pers. It appears that this is initiative is more about identifying and training the next top fragger in Swedish Counter-Strike, rather than as a way to sign new players for NiP. While players will work closely with the organisation they will still remain with the roster they competed with in the Elitserien. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/nip-path-to-ninja-talent-program\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/blast-premier-teams-csppa-clash\">CS:GO teams clash with CSPPA over BLAST Premier player protests</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/spring-2021-major-cancelled\">CS:GO major in spring 2021 reportedly cancelled by Valve</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/g2-drops-jackz\">G2 drops CS:GO veteran JaCkz</a> ",

Let's start with the stats tracker, as it is a pretty cool addition. Finally, you'll be able to properly quantify your CS:GO experience and stat-shame your fellow fraggers. The new interface will not only show you bread and bitter stats like K/D ratio, matches played, and average kills per game, but also stats for individual maps and weapons. There's also a heatmap that will show you where you get shot the most, which will be handy for over-eager peekers. A new game mode has also dropped called Retake, a 3v4 experience that sees three Ts defending a planted bomb against four CTs. Well, it's not <em>actually</em> new - it's been around on community servers for a while now, but it's making its Valve-official debut in Broken Fang. An additional twist is that players are presented with a choice of loadout cards at the beginning of a match and can pick the one that suits them best. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/operation-broken-fang\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/blast-premier-teams-csppa-clash\">CS:GO teams clash with CSPPA over BLAST Premier player protests</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/spring-2021-major-cancelled\">CS:GO major in spring 2021 reportedly cancelled by Valve</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/g2-drops-jackz\">G2 drops CS:GO veteran JaCkz</a> ",

Although it hasn't been confirmed, many believe Krimz's ban was linked to Esportal, a third-party matchmaking service which the pro regularly uses. A number of accounts linked to the platform were hit with bans, causing the service to <a href=\"https://esportal.com/news/891/esportals-statement-regarding-the-ongoing-situation-with-vac-bans\">release a statement</a> that it was caused by \"compatibility issues between our anti-cheat client and VAC.\" It didn't take long for Valve to act on the false-positive bans though. After Esportal produced the right documentation, Valve reversed the bans for the players affected - including Krimz. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/krimz-vac-ban-removed\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/blast-premier-teams-csppa-clash\">CS:GO teams clash with CSPPA over BLAST Premier player protests</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/spring-2021-major-cancelled\">CS:GO major in spring 2021 reportedly cancelled by Valve</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/g2-drops-jackz\">G2 drops CS:GO veteran JaCkz</a> ",

He and the rest of Fnatic went on to claim two Major titles at ESL One Katowice Major and ESL One Cologne, as well as countless other tournaments.

While Modern Warfare's fast-paced gameplay doesn't translate perfectly to Valve's comparatively slower shooter, it looks like the iconic Call of Duty map is surprisingly well-suited to the game as a fan map. Mitrichone, the modder responsible for the Shipment remake, has recreated the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2275228023\">Modern Warfare map</a> so perfectly that it's almost indistinguishable from the original in screenshots. This map is fully playable in every CS:GO game mode, though we think it would be most suited to Deathmatch and Wingman. Shipment's tiny size makes it a perfect Deathmatch map for non-stop frantic gameplay, and it works perfectly as a 2v2 Wingman map as shown in Modern Warfare's Gunfight mode. This recreation of Shipment is based off the Modern Warfare 2019 version, which features a number of key changes from the original version. Arguably the most important upgrade is to the map's colour pallet - instead of shades of dark blue and green, we finally see a pop of colour in the shipping containers. Judging by the reception to the fan map, we wouldn't be surprised to see Shipment 24/7 servers cropping up again. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/shipment-modern-warfare\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-halloween\">This spooky, snowy CS:GO map is ideal for Wingman mode</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/halloween-map\">A CS:GO fan has created a map inspired by the scariest Halloween movies</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-map-witcher-kaer-morhen\">CS:GO meets The Witcher 3 with this new Kaer Morhen custom map</a> ",

Coaches must also have MOss, an anti-cheat software, running in the background to secure screenshots and record logs during live games. Mulgan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mulgan95/status/1320717781839601667?s=20\">agrees the system isn't perfect</a>, but it is a significant step forward to prevent cheating. The Esports Integrity Comission (ESIC), which is investigating historic abuse of the spectator bug, revealed in its first report last month that <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/37-coaches-banned-spectator-bug\">37 coaches</a> had been found exploiting it.

The players were representing teams LAKERS, Rooster, Rooster 2, and Ground Zero at the time of the betting offenses.

Since Mantuu is helping promote the UK qualifiers for <a href=\"https://www.redbull.com/se-en/event-series/red-bull-flick\">Red Bull Flick</a>, a global 2v2 tournament, we had the opportunity to talk exclusively with the rising star.

You can see it for yourself in action in the video clip below. Set in the hills like The Witcher's own version, CS:GO Kaer Morhen features the same distinctive layout: the layered courtyards peppered with trees and crumbly rubble, cavernous old halls lit with candles and propped up with decaying beams - even Geralt's tower chamber is there, with its circular fireplace in the middle.

The ESIC assigned each offending party demerit points based on what the watchdog found during its investigation. After the ESIC dished out those points, sanction tiers were then developed to \"ensure a proportionate and reasonable level of penalty could be applied consistently across various offenders\". The highest tier of the ban period is 36 months, whereas the lowest tier is five. Other factors additionally influenced the bans given out. For example, if someone confessed to using the spectator bug before the investigation, their ban would have been reduced by 40%.

He wrote about his experiences with the bug in a <a href=\"https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srdpo0\">Twitlonger</a>, saying that in the first instance he encountered it, he was very confused but made what he believed to be the \"honorable decision\" and muted his microphone for the rest of the game. FaZe lost that game 16-1. When he encountered the bug a second time, RobbaN realised there might be something seriously wrong and it could be happening more often to other teams. This time, he notified a tournament admin, and together they rectified the view. In the ESIC investigation, RobbaN was only charged for abusing the bug in one match, meaning the commission found his decision to bring in the tournament admin sufficient proof of his innocence this time around. <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/robban-faze-coach-ban\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/og-mantuu-interview\">\"I will never let my team down\" - mantuu talks overcoming injuries, ESIC ruling, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/astralis-xyp9x-return\">Xyp9x confirms he's back playing CS:GO, will play BLAST next month</a> <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/esic-stream-snipers\">ESIC takes aim at stream snipers in official CS:GO matches</a> ",

The ESIC (Esports Integrity Commission) announced that matches from official ESL and DreamHack tournaments were analysed. Initially this resulted in bans for three coaches: MIBR's Ricardo \"dead\" Sinigaglia, Heroic's Nicolai \"HUNDEN\" Petersen, and Hard Legion's Aleksandr \"MechanoGun\" Bogatiryev. The ESIC has now announced that it's issued sanctions against 37 coaches for using the glitch. So far, the commission has checked roughly 20 percent of the total demos available for review. However, they claim that the demos they've reviewed so far \"likely comprise the most substantial cases of abuse\". Each offender has been assigned 'demerit points' that correspond to a specific sanction tier, which then outlines the duration of the ban. This standardises the sanctions to ensure that each person receives a fair penalty. Here are the sanctioning tiers and ban periods: Tier 1 (Aggravated) (eight points): 36 months Tier 1 Sanction (six to seven points): 18 months Tier 2 Sanction (three to five points): 10 months Tier 3 Sanction (fewer than three points): 5 months Those who came forward and admitted to exploiting the bug in advance may see their ban period reduced, and individuals can appeal if they want to contest their suspensions. The ESIC has also outlined that they couldn't be sure \"whether the teams related to the offending parties were complicit in the exploitation of the Spectator Bug at the time that the offences took place\". For now, here's the full list of the 37 coaches that have been banned, the team they're from, and how long each suspension will last: Twista—iGame.com: 15.75 months casle—maquinas: 10 months Dinamito—Furious Gaming: 10 months ArnoZ1K4—Evidence: 10 months Rejin—Tricked: 19.8 months glouDH—Freestyle: 10 months prd—Neverest: 10 months nook—QB Fire: 7.5 months rikz—DETONA: 10 months Apoka—Luminosity/INTZ/BOOM: 5.4 months MechanoGun—Hard Legion: 36 months Hellpopovich—9z: 10 months fuRy^—DreamEaters: 7.5 months Solaar—Syman/k23: 10 months HUNDEN—Heroic: 8 months dead—SK Gaming/MIBR: 6.5 months guerri—FURIA: 4 months pita—Ninjas in Pyjamas: 10 months AKIMOV—Hard Legion: 7.5 months F_1N—Gambit Youngsters: 8.75 months ellllll—Imperial/paiN: 10 months peu—W7M: 5 months RobbaN—FaZe Clan: 5.5 months Loord—Team Kinguin/Aristocracy: 6 months ToH1o—ex-Outlaws/Windigo Gaming: 10 months Andi—NAVI: 10 months pepik—eSuba: 10 months B1GGY—Heretics: 7.5 months chrille—Epsilon/Red Reserve: 10 months starix—NAVI: 10 months ave—North: 6 months rosey—Nordavind: 10 months LMBT_R—Hellraisers/forZe: 7.5 months FeTiSh—Heroic: 3.75 months miNIr0x—AGO: 3.75 months pNshr—SKADE: 3.75 months ruggah—Dignitas: 3.75 months The investigation also revealed that the Spectator Bug had previously been reported to admins in non-ESIC member tournaments as early as 2017, but the ESIC has stated that they were \"not aware of how these reports were treated by non-members as we do not have operational visibility of any actions that were taken. Accordingly, ESIC will not make any comment relating to prior reports of the Spectator Bug to tournament admins by individuals.\" Thanks, Dexerto.",

The Ancient Egyptian temple-inspired Anubis map's spawn points have been shifted \"slightly apart from each other\" to enable \"better movement\". The dev has also added some grenade clips onto \"short A for smoothing bouncing\" as well as fixed some minor \"nitpicking stuff\" on the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> radar. It's not quite clear what this stuff is from the notes, but it sounds like a little tidy-up to improve clarity.

On top of that, it's expanded with its own battle royale mode and heaps of new maps, and it's even gone free-to-play. Since its release in 1999, Counter-Strike has always had a reputation for being hard to start playing. Anyone who plays it will have a story for you about how badly they got thrashed when they first started out, and countless new players have been scared off by CS' steep learning curve over the last decade and a half. While its core mechanics are relatively simple - simply point the gun towards your enemies and shoot - once you dip below the surface, Counter-Strike quickly proves to be a much deeper game than it first seems.

In a post on <a href=\"https://esic.gg/esports-integrity-commission-opens-inquiry-into-historical-spectator-bug-exploitation/\">the official site</a>, the ESIC outlines the reasoning behind, and broad methodology, of the inquiry. At the start of September, coaches from Hard Legion, Heroic, and MIRB received suspensions from ESL for exploiting a glitch that allowed them to see the whole map and essentially spy on the opposing team. The ESIC has saw it fit to perform a wider look into other instances of the glitch being used to gain an upper hand. \"We have reason to believe that exploitation of the spectator bug by other parties than those already sanctioned, may have existed historically,\" the post reads. \"Accordingly, ESIC has decided to establish an inquiry into the exploitation of the spectator bug dating back to 2016.\" Over the next eight months, some 25,000 demos from 2016 through to now will be reviewed by the ESIC, using AI and human eyes, in collaboration with esports referee Michal Slowinski and IT specialiat Steve Dudenhoeffer, who discovered the exploit. The ESIC itself was founded in 2016, hence the specific remit.

But, software and peripherals company Logitech has developed a new way to help players of all experience levels hone their skills in the game. It's a program called Playmaster, and is \"backed by science and built with professional esports organisations\" to help CS:GO fans improve. \"Playmaster is designed to capture specific data from gamers - from amateurs to esports pros - to help them understand how to reach their full potential,\" a <a href=\"https://blog.logitech.com/2020/09/03/play-like-the-pros-with-playmaster-by-logitech-g/\">post</a> on Logitech's site (via <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21421224/logitech-g-playmaster-software-assessment-training-esports-counter-strike-global-offensive\">The Verge</a>) says. The tool's beta version is now available for all players to try out to \"analyse their play and improve specific skills, such as targeting acquisition, map navigation, and player movement\". The way the software program works is by getting CS:GO players to complete an initial \"baseline skills assessment\", which lasts around 30 minutes. This allows them to identify their own specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they fare relative to both the average CS:GO community performance and the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> top pro players. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-training-tool-playmaster\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/bug-investigation\">Esports Integrity Commission launches investigation into CS:GO spectator bug</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/pusha-t\">Pusha T and Logic's CS:GO team withdrew from an ESL One match to highlight protests against police brutality</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/report-bots-fixed\">Looks like CS:GO is saying bye-bye to \"report botting\"</a> ",

The three coaches banned are Aleksandr 'MechanoGun' Bogatiryev of Hard Legion Esports, Ricardo 'dead' Sinigaglia of MiBR, and Nicolai 'HUNDEN' Petersen of Heroic. The bans came a day after Heroic won ESL One: Cologne and scooped the $150,000 prize, though Heroic was not found to be using the exploit at all during this tournament.

Now, thanks to one Lego-savvy fan, it seems that it's Counter-Strike's turn to be transformed into a small, cube-based project. A CS:GO player, who goes by the username Mexicandemon2, has recreated a section of the Dust II map using their Lego set and posted a picture of their build to Reddit earlier today. The fan has decided to focus on the Bombsite A section of the map, which will be familiar to any Counter-Strike player. While this may seem like an unlikely crossover, it actually works rather well and the build is incredibly accurate.

The system, designed by the Counter-Strike Professional Players' Association, takes the emphasis off needing to attend every event in order for pros to hold onto their current fixture, as well as improving the overall environment of top-level play. Reported by our friends <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/csppa-world-rankings\">The Loadout</a>, the CSPPA World Ranking is designed by the association and over 30 CS:GO player representatives and consultants. The overhauled leaderboard for the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game</a> is based around three key areas: creating a more sustainable work-life for pros, increased simplicity and transparency, and greater inclusivity and diversity. On that first point, players will now have their ranking protected from absence-related penalties due to mental health issues, injury, or illness. Individual matches won't contribute to their placing either, nor will events that aren't part of the CSPPA World Ranking remit. Rankings are to be decided from tournaments spanning a longer period, too, meaning that a mid-season dip isn't the be all, end all of an otherwise strong run. \"I think that rankings need to consider our mental health, and that a protected ranking is a really good change to the scene,\" Markus 'Kjaerbye' Kjærbye, a member of FaZe Clan's CS:GO team, said. \"It's important to protect the teams and not put extra pressure on the person who is injured or having mental health problems.\" <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/world-ranking\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-sniper-games\">The best sniper games on PC</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-update\">CS:GO update - the latest changes to the world's best FPS</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-vfx-changes-update\">New CS:GO update changes Dust 2's doors, adds special \"Boost Player Contrast\" filter</a> ",

There's a whole range of weapons and designs available, with MAC-10s, Glocks, Desert Eagles, and the classic AK-47 all getting a makeover. Some of these designs are classic two tone affairs, others have a graffiti overlay, while there's a few with designs inspired by various cultures too.

While the likes of League of Legends and Rainbow Six Siege spend weeks testing every small change, CS:GO's biggest updates typically come out of the blue.

Each time Valve make significant patches to the game, we will let you know what is worth worrying about, what isn't, and also provide as full a changelog as we are able to.

The changes, which were added in last night's patch, are an attempt to crack down on cheating in Valve's iconic shooter, but they've already been causing some problems. Trusted mode, which was trialled and tested in June, blocks naughty software like cheats and scripts from working while CS:GO is up and running, but it's also causing some problems. According to <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/07/09/counter-strike-global-offensives-latest-anti-cheat-effort-is-trusted-mode/\">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, trusted mode is unfortunately blocking things like OBS, Discord, and various Nvidia software. Trusted mode is launched by default, according to the <a href=\"https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2020/07/30738/\">latest patch notes</a>, and can be turned off if the game is launched with the -untrusted command.

He&rsquo;s really very good. <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/05/07/please-watch-this-man-perform-videogame-soundtracks-on-his-mongolian-string-instrument/#more-828369\" class=\"more-link\"> (more&hellip;) </a> ",

His now defunct portfolio site went on a lengthy rant about it: &ldquo;Yes, you read it right. I am the creator of this unholy monster.

It is sad that there are many txt files in rotation from kids that claim to have made this map, but you have now stumbled upon the true author&hellip;&rdquo; Was RD actually responsible for making one of <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/04/22/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map/\">the most influential and popular game maps of all time</a>? I began a forensic investigation to verify its authorship, digging through the ancient detritus of dead Geocities pages, Angelfire websites, and Romanian file servers.

It was a small simple grey killbox of a map that virtually anyone could&rsquo;ve made within the first few hours of downloading the editor tools. fy_iceworld quickly became one of the most popular and divisive CS maps at my school. I was, of course, one of the haters. I tried to convince my friends to vote against fy_iceworld on our local internet cafe&rsquo;s CS server, but they argued that I was just salty about being bad at it (which was partly true) and they forced the mapchange anyway. Similar conversations played out across countless clan servers, cyber cafes, PC bangs, and LAN parties around the entire world. To properly gauge fy_iceworld&rsquo;s influence and legacy, I asked several working level designers for their takes.

        "contents": "The decade in Counter-Strike truly began on August 21, 2012, but the seven years since made up for its late start. In the 2010s Counter-Strike grew to become one of the largest esports in the world and arguably Valve&apos;s flagship game, depending on how you feel about Dota 2. And though its future is uncertain, Counter-Strike is in a far better place now than it was 10 years ago. Let&#x2019;s look back on the evolution of Counter-Strike by examining the biggest moments in the series of the past decade. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive launches It&apos;s easy to forget that in 2010, Counter-Strike was in a tough spot. The community was split between the Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source for years, and Valve had given neither game the level of attention and updates we now expect from competitive games. By 2011, Valve announced a sequel, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. CS:GO aimed to unite both 1.6 and Source players, but interestingly, one of the initial goals of the project was also to bring the series to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 before a new generation of hardware appeared.&#xA0; Longtime fans of the series didn&apos;t immediately switch over at launch, however, thanks to bugs and mechanical changes (for example, absence of flinch animations). For a time, CS&apos; population was almost evenly split between three games, something I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve ever seen in a competitive franchise. Fortunately, thanks to a number of quick updates in the early months of the game (and the addition of an item economy one year later), CS:GO began to stand on its own and unite Counter-Strike players new and old. Ninjas in Pyjamas domination&#xA0; 87 wins. Zero losses. That is the longest match winning streak on LAN in CS:GO history. And it is held by the game&#x2019;s very first superteam: Ninjas in Pyjamas. When CS:GO launched, the Swedish organization brought together many of the stars of both 1.6 and Source and formed a squad that was unmatched. Even when their match streak was broken in 2013, NiP continued to win tournaments throughout the remainder of the year and into 2014. This culminated in a Major championship at <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-highlights-from-csgos-esl-one-cologne-2014-tournament/\"> ESL One: Cologne 2014 </a>, the team&#x2019;s only Major victory in five Grand Finals appearances. Their success helped raise the standard of play and the profile of CS:GO. All things must end, however, and NiP began to decline later that year. But in its period of dominance, the team spurred fellow CS:GO players and teams to greater competitive heights. Valve adds a new gun, experiences instant regret&#xA0; Over the development of its most successful multiplayer shooter before CS:GO, Team Fortress 2, Valve had figured out a playbook for keeping the game interesting: make guns and items that subverts players&apos; expectations, pulling the rug out from under them. On December 8, 2015, did exactly that when it introduced the R8 Revolver to CS:GO, but the effect it had was instantly harmful. What made the R8, dubbed the Revolvo by the community, so notorious was its unparalleled power-per-dollar. It could kill unarmored and armored targets alike with a close range body shot, was more accurate at a longer range than an AK-47, and could be fired while defusing a bomb. All of this in a sidearm, meaning it could be carried alongside an AWP. When the update was introduced, matches quickly devolved into 5v5 shootouts where everyone used the R8. In what is one of the fastest response times from Valve in its history, nearly every aspect of the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-r8-revolver-gets-nerfed-after-three-days/\"> R8 was nerfed </a> within three days after it was originally introduced. It instantly fell out of use, and it&#x2019;s rarely seen nowadays. But for a brief time, the Revolvo was king.&#xA0; The rise of skins (and skin gambling) While CS:GO was popular, the addition of weapon skins made it skyrocket to the top of the Steam charts. With their introduction in August 2013, a virtual economy formed that saw players trading the skins they had acquired, be it from weapon cases, watching competitive games, or random in-game drops. But as the skin economy grew, the economy behind it began to move outside of the more regulated confines of the Steam Marketplace. Websites that used Steam&#x2019;s API created skin gambling, where players on competitive matches by using their skins as currency. Scandals quickly followed; <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\"> players were banned for match fixing using skins </a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"> lawsuits were filed over underage gambling </a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/state-regulator-orders-valve-to-halt-csgo-skin-gambling-through-steam/\"> and governments opened investigations into how Valve handled the practice </a>. In a way, the controversies over skin gambling parallel the loot box scandals that would come in 2017. While Valve has done much to combat it, skin gambling remains active to this day. An American team finally wins a Major The most important tournaments in CS:GO are the Majors, which feature the biggest prize pools and the best teams. And while every Major has compelling storylines, the ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018 stands a cut above the rest thanks to the David vs. Goliath saga of Cloud9. With most of this era dominated by Europe, the American team was an underdog heading into the 2018 tournament. Cloud9 had never finished in the Top 8 at a Major, and recent performances left a lot to be desired. Against all odds, Cloud9 surpassed several of the best teams in the world and found itself squaring off against the superstars of FaZe Clan in the Grand Finals. Ultimately, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/cloud9-boston-major-csgo/\"> Cloud9 upset FaZe </a> in a double-overtime final map to win the Boston Major. It was the first time an American team won a Major&#x2014;on home soil, no less. Though the roster broke up before the players could defend their title, Cloud9&#x2019;s win in Boston stands as one of the greatest moments in CS:GO. CS:GO goes free-to-play CS:GO&#x2019;s structure forever changed in December 2018 when Valve made it free-to-play after six years and added a new battle royale mode called Danger Zone. Considering both moves came at a time when the battle royale genre had taken the video game industry by storm, it was clear that both decisions were made to shore up CS:GO&#x2019;s playerbase. One day after the change was made, over <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-receives-14000-negative-steam-reviews-in-a-single-day-after-going-free-to-play/\"> 14,000 negative Steam reviews </a> hit its store page decrying the move to free-to-play, citing the lack of reward for players who paid for the game and the changes to matchmaking as two prime factors. Despite player unhappiness, the days immediately following the transition saw CS:GO reach its highest player count in nearly two years.&#xA0; ",

I&#8217;m happy enough for the over-performing bedroom AI to have a grandiose name, even though that number might have more to do with Valve&#8217;s own software than Eggs&#8217;es. <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/11/26/teenager-identifies-over-14000-csgo-cheaters-with-homebrewed-ai/#more-761333\" class=\"more-link\"> (more&hellip;) </a> ",

In-game terrorist factions like the &quot;Phoenix Connexion&quot; or &quot;Elite Crew&quot; have fought spec-ops groups like GSG-9 and the SAS. Through the immeasurable repetition of CS, these drab default outfits embedded themselves in the identity of the game. With Operation Shattered Web, that&apos;s changing. &quot;For the first time in CS:GO, unlock all-new T and CT-sided characters equippable on any map,&quot; <a href=\"http://counter-strike.net/shatteredweb\"> writes Valve </a> on a microsite announcing the update. &quot;All-new CT Operators and T Agents are available as mission progress rewards. Complete missions and earn Stars to unlock them and equip them for deployment. Or equip the default Local Agent or Operator to use the pre-existing map-based characters.&quot; The new characters are unlockable, equippable skins, essentially. There are 22 of them, and Valve uses rarity-like descriptors like &quot;Superior Agent&quot; and &quot;Exceptional Agent&quot; to distinguish them. The highest tier are &quot;Master Agents,&quot; like Lt. Commander Ricksaw or Special Agent Ava of the FBI. These four characters come with special voice lines and animations (presumably third-person, end-of-match celebrations, not first-person animations).&#xA0; Shattered Web, CS:GO&apos;s first operation in two years, is $15. That&apos;s a bump from the $6 that operations like Hydra (2017) and Wildfire (2016) were priced at. These earlier operations mostly introduced new maps and modes to CS:GO, which Shattered Web also includes: Studio, Lunacy, and Jungle, each available in different modes of play. A package of new skins, stickers, and cosmetic graffiti are also available. ",

In other words, the keys will not be able to leave the purchasing account, thus making it impossible to sell them on the Steam Community Market. The reason? Valve has learned that they&apos;re being used to launder money. &quot;In the past, most key trades we observed were between legitimate customers,&quot; the company wrote on the <a href=\"https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2019/10/26113/\" target=\"_blank\">Counter-Strike website</a>.&#xA0; &quot;However, worldwide fraud networks have recently shifted to using CS:GO keys to liquidate their gains. At this point, nearly all key purchases that end up being traded or sold on the marketplace are believed to be fraud-sourced. As a result we have decided that newly purchased keys will not be tradeable or marketable.&quot; The statement adds that while some (but clearly not many) legitimate users may be affected, &quot;combating fraud is something we continue to prioritize across Steam and our products&quot;. Valve also notes in its statement that &quot;pre-existing CS:GO container keys are unaffected&#x2013;those keys can still be sold on the Steam Community Market and traded.&quot; It&apos;s a big deal to have Valve directly acknowledge that keys are being used for money laundering, and of course, it&apos;s not the first time CS:GO&apos;s reward systems have been used in shady ways. CS:GO skin gambling came under the spotlight in 2016 when two prominent YouTubers were found to be <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\" target=\"_blank\">heavily promoting without disclosure</a> their own skin lottery website. Valve gave chase, issuing more than <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-issues-cease-and-desist-orders-to-more-than-20-csgo-gambling-sites/\" target=\"_blank\">20 cease-and-desist orders</a> against similar sites, but that didn&apos;t stop the Washington State Gambling Commission <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/state-regulator-orders-valve-to-halt-csgo-skin-gambling-through-steam/\" target=\"_blank\">from getting involved</a>. In response to looming regulation in France, last month a CS:GO update introduced <a href=\"https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2019/09/25667/\" target=\"_blank\">a new X-ray Scanner</a> for that country, which basically allows users to check the content of containers before they&apos;re unlocked.&#xA0; ",

The AI is called Minerva, and it&apos;s built by a team at online gaming platform FACEIT&#x2014;which organised 2018&apos;s CS:GO London Major&#x2014;in collaboration with Google Cloud and Jigsaw, a Google tech incubator. Minerva started examining CS:GO chat messages in late August, and in the first month-and-a-half marked 7,000,000 messages as toxic, issued 90,000 warnings, and banned 20,000 players.&#xA0; The AI, trained through machine learning, first issued a warning for verbal abuse if it perceived a toxic message, while also flagging spam messages. Within a few seconds of a match finishing, Minerva sent notifications of either a warning or a ban to the offending player, and punishments grew harsher for repeat offenders. The number of toxic messages reduced from by 20% between August and September while the AI was in use, and the number of unique players sending toxic messages dropped by 8%.&#xA0; The trial started after &quot;months&quot; of eliminating false positives, and it&apos;s only the first step in rolling out Minerva to online games. &quot;In-game chat detection is only the first and most simplistic of the applications of Minerva and more of a case study that serves as a first step toward our vision for this AI,&quot; FACEIT said in a <a href=\"https://blog.faceit.com/revealing-minerva-and-addressing-toxicity-and-abusive-behavior-in-matches-9073914a51c\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. &quot;We&#x2019;re really excited about this foundation as it represents a strong base that will allow us to improve Minerva until we finally detect and address all kinds of abusive behaviors in real-time.&quot; &quot;In the coming weeks we will announce new systems that will support Minerva in her training.&quot; Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-faceit-ban\" target=\"_blank\">PCGamesN</a>.

        "contents": "Valve, alongside its business partner in China, Perfect World, has given us an update on the progress of Steam China today, after both companies had been silent on the topic for over a year. Eurogamer attended the brief presentation, given by Perfect World CEO Dr. Robert H. Xiao in Shanghai, where a small number of local and international press were told the companies were \"one more step closer\" to launching Steam China, which will be separate from the international version of Steam. A handful of launch games were revealed, including Dota 2 and Dota Underlords. There were no actual launch dates or broader windows mentioned for Steam China itself, mind, nor a look at how that storefront may shape up or any details on its features, barring the fact it'll support VR, multiplayer games, interesting games with \"innovative, creative ideas,\" and \"single-player games with abundant storylines\". As far as we could tell, none of the non-Chinese launch games had official approval just yet, either. In Xiao's words, \"the Steam China project is undergoing solidly and smoothly\" - but what is it, exactly? As it stands, Steam is actually widely available for Chinese players already. As of right now we've tested and confirmed it's possible to buy, download and play games through the Steam store in China as usual, with no issues - and no need for a VPN. Community features, such as discussion forums, are unavailable, but otherwise the platform as it stands still acts as a huge loophole in the Chinese government's strict regulation of games. Where it might take many months of admin and applications for a game to get through the approval process - if it gets through at all - or many revisions to a game's content to ensure it meets the various Chinese standards, that same game can already be bought and played in China, unfiltered, unregistered and unchanged, on regular old Steam. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-21-valve-talks-steam-china-curation-exclusivity\">Read more</a> ",

It&#8217;s no understatement to say that we haven&#8217;t seen a game enter the mainstream in this way since Minecraft &#8211; but it&#8217;s not the only battle royale out there, and the genre has never before seen such quantity nor such quality.

        "contents": "Anna Nordlander started competing in Counter-Strike in 2003. Sixteen years later, she&apos;s the chief operating officer at DreamHack, the international esports company that started the event that changed her life. You slept on the floor and the prize pool was next to nothing. Anna Nordlander A lot has changed in the years since Nordlander&apos;s first tournament. Instead of Counter-Strike 1.6, esports teams are playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Okay, that&apos;s not actually a big change&#x2014;but with massive games like Fortnite and League of Legends and Dota 2 pushing esports forward, players are now competing for millions of dollars on massive stages, streamed to fans all over the world. And <em>that</em> is a different world than the one Anna Nordlander stepped into in 2002.&#xA0; Back then, Nordlander spent all her free-time on Battle.net, struggling to keep her 36K modem signed onto the internet, battling off phone calls from unaware friends and family. &quot;After living my days on Battle.net&#x2014;chatting and playing with new people&#x2014;there was no turning back. When I was 13 my brother introduced me to Counter-Strike and this was different and addictive in another way,&quot; she says. She joined her classmates playing Counter-Strike&#x2014;mostly teenage boys&#x2014;before they started organizing LAN events and competing as a team. &quot;Being a girl was not a problem when I played with my classmates or other people I already knew, but online it was a different story,&quot; Nordlander says. Esports wasn&#x2019;t as professional or mainstream back in the early 2000s. Tournaments weren&#x2019;t being played in large arenas. There was little money involved. &quot;You would often pay the travel yourself, or force your parents to drive you to a LAN in a small town somewhere far away. You slept on the floor and the prize pool was next to nothing.&quot; But there was DreamHack. DreamHack has been running for 25 years; it started in a Swedish school cafeteria in 1994. It operated first as a LAN party and grew from there, with tournaments and partnerships. More than anything else, it was a way for players spread across the country&#x2014;and later, the world&#x2014;to get together. Especially as a woman playing competitively, that was a big deal. &quot;I was there for joining an all-female clan and in 2002, we attended our first DreamHack,&quot; she says. &quot;DreamHack was like nothing I ever experienced before. It really was the promised land, and meeting everyone I had been playing with for so long is something that was really special.&#x201D; Despite the lack of mainstream support for esports back then, the little communities built around these events were intimate, personal. Social media wasn&#x2019;t a huge part of our lives. We didn&#x2019;t livestream. Making connections was different, and finally meeting face-to-face was, too. &quot;I&#x2019;ll always cherish the golden age of World of Warcraft, Nordlander says. &quot;When we did shoutouts at BlizzCon 2008, people could challenge us in WoW Arena, a lot of people would be very confident coming up to us, telling us &#x2018;I&#x2019;m from BG9, watch out.&#x2019; We didn&#x2019;t drop a single game over two days and in the end, we had to give away all the prizes that people were supposed to win.&quot; (Back in the day, battlegrounds in WoW Arena were sectioned off into battle groups so that different realms could battle each other&#x2014;BG9, also called US-Bloodlust, was considered one of the most competitive of the time.) Nordlander said the industry has grown dramatically since then, but the past five years have shown the most drastic changes. &quot;Fortnite has been going more mainstream. I&#x2019;ve seen grandmas flossing, and Drake, Zlatan and other more traditional celebrities playing and praising the game. From CS:GO to COO I m not afraid of going after something I want even though everyone tells you it can t be done. Anna Nordlander Now, retired from the competitive life, Nordlander has her hands in everything esports. As the COO of DreamHack, she&apos;s always on the move. It feels like there&#x2019;s a new DreamHack event every week: DreamHack Summer 2019 was in June, then Valencia in July, Montreal in September. From there, it&#x2019;s onto Rotterdam, Atlanta, J&#xF6;nk&#xF6;ping, and Sevilla. Sometimes she&#x2019;s rolling cables to support the massive technical infrastructure necessarily in putting on events of this size. Other times she&#x2019;s grabbing coffee to keep members of the team running. A lot of the time, she&#x2019;s meeting with various industry people at events, and just keeping a general eye on things. &quot;I really like to be hands-on and to learn new things,&quot; Nordlander told me shortly after DreamHack Dallas in early June. &quot;It&#x2019;s exciting to see how many interesting people are coming out to our events.&quot; The role of the COO is, naturally, in operations&#x2014;coordinating departments, managing staff, and setting processes. Nordlander says the way she played games competitively helped prepare her for the job. &quot;I think that optimizing workflows and processes to make them more efficient is something I&#x2019;ve always enjoyed, but maybe in different forms. Already in the early Super Mario days, I used to play the same level over and over to perfect it.&quot; Nordlander began working with DreamHack unofficially in 2008 and 2009, organizing World of Warcraft events and covering the event for a Swedish national television channel called SVT, both behind and in front of the camera. At the same time she was working on three degrees at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm: a Bachelor of Science in interactive media, a Master of Science in human-computer interaction, and a Master of Engineering in media technology. After graduating college in 2013, she began working for a Swedish media company&apos;s esports division. In 2015, that company acquired DreamHack, as well as a large part of esports tournament organizer Turtle Entertainment, which operates ESL. Within two and a half years, she made her way from DreamHack product manager to marketing, where she built the festival series&#x2019; marketing department from scratch, to the job of COO. &quot;I have honestly loved every minute of it, especially building my own team,&quot; Nordlander says. &quot;I sometimes can&#x2019;t believe I get to work with something I&#x2019;m so passionate about, and, on top of that, at the company who opened my eyes to a whole new world back in 2002.&quot; <a target=\"_blank\"> An award ceremony at DreamHack Showdown Valencia 2019 </a> Though DreamHack is an international event, it was born in Sweden. It&#x2019;s where Nordlander was introduced to competitive esports. Sweden has a rich history in Counter-Strike; at the time of writing, Swedish players are ranked number two in the world for earnings in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, second only to Denmark. (Sweden is ranked at number one in Counter-Strike.) This is, of course, thanks in part to the country-wide infrastructure built up by DreamHack. Even at the start of esports integration in the country&#x2014;when players were sleeping on the floor and winning little-to-no money&#x2014;there were still compelling events that encouraged fans to compete. Nordlander says one of her favorite moments with DreamHack was a culmination of those things&#x2014;her Swedish nationality and work in the esports industry. Her first project with DreamHack was DreamHack Masters Malm&#xF6; 2016, and the first DreamHack event as part of the DreamHack Masters, a new series. The event was a culmination of months of qualifications, not the mention the work before that behind the scenes. Sixteen teams made it to the live event at the Malm&#xF6; Arena in Sweden, among them the best of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive: Natus Vincere, EnVyUs, GODSENT, Dignitas, Virtus.pro, and Ninjas in Pyjamas. For the two fully-Swedish teams, Ninjas in Pyjamas and GODSENT, home soil was an advantage&#x2014;until they had to play each other in the semi-finals. Ninjas in Pyjamas prevailed with a 2-1 score, but then they had to face the Russia/Ukranian team Natus Vincere. When it came down to it, Ninjas in Pyjamas won. &quot;Having a Swedish team winning on home soil just made everything so complete, Nordlander says. &quot;I actually shed some tears when the Ninjas entered the stage to a roaring Swedish crowd. It was just so beautiful. We worked so hard to pull off the event, and we couldn&#x2019;t have wished for a better end.&quot; From here, the rest of Nordlander&#x2019;s year is busy. Again: Sweden, Spain, Canada, Canada again, Sweden, Netherlands, Georgia, Sweden, and back around to Spain. All of these events are just this year, a schedule that easily demonstrates just how much DreamHack&#x2014;with the help of Nordlander and the rest of the team&#x2014;has grown from a school basement in a small Swedish town. &quot;Being a girl playing games has also taught me to handle the kind of tough environment that can occur in this male-dominated industry, Nordlander says. &quot;I&#x2019;m not afraid of going after something I want&#x2014;even though everyone tells you it can&#x2019;t be done.&quot; ",

The theme will be “Counter-Strike” itself, including all things CS-related, from the original Counter-Strike mod to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The weapon finish and sticker designs may be created in any style. We will need weapons for all tiers to complete the case, from Mil-Spec to Covert; consider this when designing your weapon finishes. All designs must be original with the exception of Counter-Strike logos or icons. To help sort these themed submissions, please tag them with \"CS20\" in the title of your submission to the workshop (e.g. CS20 | Finish Name). All previous submissions are eligible for the event. Just make sure to tag them so we can find them more easily. All submissions for this event must be completed and submitted to the workshop by September 19th 2019. The Weapon Case and Sticker Capsule will be released at a later date, after we have chosen which submissions will be included. All items submitted for this event will still be eligible for future releases. We have also released a new style guide to help with weapon finish creation, and hopefully answer any questions you may have about the process. The guide can be found here.",

The focus of the lawsuit appears to be <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\">CS:GO</a> skins, which led to the Washington State Gambling Commission <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/state-regulator-orders-valve-to-halt-csgo-skin-gambling-through-steam/\" target=\"_blank\">ordering Valve to halt the &apos;gambling&apos; of skins</a> through Steam, back in 2016. At the time, a Valve spokesperson made it clear that using Steam to run a gambling business &quot;is not allowed by our API nor our user agreements,&quot; and that it had sent cease and desist letters to over 40 websites.&#xA0;Another lawsuit against Valve over gambling was <a href=\"https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/10/federal-court-rejects-online-gambling-lawsuit-against-steam-mcleod-v-valve.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rejected</a> back in October 2016. This lawsuit, stamped April 3rd, alleges that Valve is &quot;well aware of the skins gambling that goes on, is well aware that skins have real world cash value, which has increased their popularity and value, and actively encourages and facilitates skins gambling.&quot; The lawsuit is more than 20 pages long. You can read the details <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/406030967/Quinault-v-Valve#from_embed\" target=\"_blank\">here on Scribd</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/valve-hit-illegal-gambling-lawsuit-native-american-nation-operates-casino-washington-state/\" target=\"_blank\">Geekwire.com</a>).

First-time submissions to the CS:GO workshop will now require email verification before the item can be listed publicly. For those of you that have previously submitted Workshop items, you shouldn't see any change in functionality. Background What do we mean by fake item scams? If you browse the Workshop enough, you may have come across an item with an image of a rare skin, promising giveaways or free content. These items often contain phishing links that are used to compromise Steam accounts. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3381077/ebd6f7494eda176115d017bd821427b7dcc91491.jpg In the past, our moderation team would review Workshop items reported by players. Fake item scams would then be deleted and our team would reach out to the owner of the account and let them know that their account is likely compromised. The problem with this approach was that some items went unreported for quite a while, allowing them to appear to players and get in the way of real submissions. New Process With today's update, Steam will send an email to the account owner when a new item is posted for the first time, asking them to review and confirm the item they just posted. If an item was posted without their knowledge, this email provides an easy path to recover the account and change their password. Our aim with this change is to reduce the potential for scams on the Steam platform, without creating unnecessary hassle for frequent Workshop creators. Let us know if you have feedback.",

        "contents": "<a target=\"_blank\"> MIBR in a group huddle. Photo by Bart Oerbekke </a> MIBR were dressed in their electric yellow synthetic jerseys every time I saw them at IEM Katowice. Even if this was your first Counter-Strike tournament, even if you were walking into an esports hall completely blind to the culture, the national allegiance of the six young men on stage was aggressively clear. On the Brazilian flag, that yellow symbolizes wealth; it lit up the uniforms the Brazilian soccer team wore during each of their five World Cup titles, too. Last year, when this team switched parent companies from SK Gaming to Immortals, they resurrected a familiar name: MIBR, Made in Brazil, sheathed in the same colors that have delivered glory to their countrymen so many times before. We want to represent our country, we want to make our country proud of us. Marcelo David According to Marcelo &quot;Coldzera&quot; David, a player who at times has been the best Counter-Strike marksman in the world, that christening was a no brainer. &quot;We create a brand for Brazil. That&apos;s why we brought back MIBR, we want to represent our country, we want to make our country proud of us,&quot; he says. &quot;To create a legacy. A Brazilian legacy.&quot; The first teams fielded under the MIBR name date all the way back to 2003, during the Counter Strike 1.6 days, a time when esports was still largely underground and punk rock. As a nation, Brazil was in the halcyon stages of an economic boom, and its citizenry was falling in love with first-person shooters. &quot;Since I was young Counter-Strike was always in the LAN houses. It was a game that didn&apos;t require an extremely good computer at the time,&quot; says Augusto C&#xE9;sar, a fan swaddled in a Brazilian flag, in the IEM Katowice food court. &quot;For us it was a very simple game to play.&quot; Two decades later, the country fields one of the best CS:GO squads in the world. The modern incarnation of MIBR captured a major title last year at the ZOTAC Cup, and five premieres and an additional major in 2017, under the SK banner. They represent a glacial power shift in the fabric of esports. Scroll through the attending teams at Katowice, and you&apos;ll see that between the Americans, the Ukrainians, and the French, MIBR is the only organization representing South America.&#xA0; Coldzera playing at IEM Katowice. Photo by Jennika Ojala. You could feel it in the air. MIBR&apos;s success is an exception to the global rule. The fans know it, the scene knows it, and it summons up a one-of-a-kind passion. Katowice is a dinky Polish mining town at the southern end of the country, and the Spodek Arena is a communist-era UFO-like relic built in 1971 that serves hockey games and B-list festivals. Still, miraculously, the Brazilians showed up in droves for the boys. They dotted the seats and the outer hallways, and most, like C&#xE9;sar, brought with them their national colors. That makes sense; if MIBR is going to wear a patriotic yellow, then it behooves their supporters to follow suit. But their loyalty took on a different texture than any of the other esports organizations at IEM. Sure, the Danes root for the Danish wunderkinds in Astralis, and it was genuinely heartwarming to see the underdog Finns in ENCE make a deliriously joyful run to the finals, but MIBR are the only ones to literally emblazon what they&apos;re fighting for in their name. Brazilians hear that call no matter where they are. &quot;I didn&apos;t play Counter-Strike for a while, I wasn&apos;t interested in it until Brazil started to get big. Like, &apos;Oh, Brazilians are really nice at this game, I need to play it too,&apos;&quot; continues C&#xE9;sar. &quot;It&apos;s what got me into esports. Brazilian teams succeeding. I think most Brazilians are like that.&quot; One of the things I love most about sports&#x2014;the local, tribal pride, and its corresponding politics&#x2014;has always been de-emphasized in competitive gaming. The Overwatch League&apos;s home cities may be slowly changing that. Generally, teams take their identity from an overarching brand or sponsor&#x2014;we pull for our favorites the way 14-year olds pull for LeBron, regardless of what team he&apos;s currently playing for. But MIBR is a different beast. The kinship is closer because of the sheer rarity of other Brazilian role-models in pop culture. Since 2016 the majority of the headlines coming out of the country have focused on either a beleaguered Olympics bid, a troubling presidential election, or mounting corruption scandals, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/esports/article-6035269/Neymar-plays-CS-professional-esports-player-coldzera.html\"> but when Neymar Jr. joins Coldzera on Dust II, </a> all of that fades away. <a target=\"_blank\"> Photo by Bart Oerbekke. </a> We're always named as a third-world country, that we don't have any potential, so anyone who can change that misconception, in any sport, it's very important to us. Rodrigo Guerra &quot;Brazilians like to cheer for Brazilians that could win. It happens in soccer and basketball, when we have a chance to win a trophy, Brazilian blood heats up. One thing we miss in Brazil is someone who can represent us and show our good side,&quot; explains Rodrigo Guerra, a journalist who covers MIBR for ESPN Brazil. &quot;A few decades back we had a famous driver, Ayrton Senna, and everyone woke up at four in the morning to cheer him. Because he&apos;s carrying our flag, he&apos;s showing how we can be one of the best. We&apos;re always named as a third-world country, that we don&apos;t have any potential, so anyone who can change that misconception, in any sport, it&apos;s very important to us.&quot; I was left with one lingering question at Katowice: Why Counter-Strike? What is it about this game in particular that&apos;s found such a home in Brazil? Sure, you can catch a few stray Brazilian squads in DOTA, and fighting games represent one of the true international scenes on the planet, but when you look at League, or Overwatch, or StarCraft, you rarely find much star power outside of the European and East Asian strongholds. I&apos;m not the only one who&apos;s noticed that, either. &quot;Since the beginning of esports in Brazil, everyone was playing Counter-Strike,&quot; says Guerra. &quot;StarCraft, or League of Legends, it&apos;s not natural to us.&quot; Everyone I posed that question to returned to the same core point. Counter-Strike was, and is, a fixture of the LAN cafe scene in Brazil, and its resonance in the games culture grew out from there. It just stuck. It&apos;s an answer that&apos;s about as arcane as anything else in the esports industry. I mean, why do South Koreans excel at StarCraft? A variety of historical accidents, that eventually coalesced into a national heritage and sense of ownership. This isn&apos;t an exact science. Coldzera, at least, is able to take a unique perspective, since he admits to me that he does keep a League of Legends habit during off-hours. &quot;League and Dota are amazing games, but the difference between our sport and them is that they&apos;re more mechanical,&quot; he says. &quot;In Counter-Strike, you have to factor in the randomness. You can kill someone blind, you can spray and kill one more. That&apos;s why the game is so great. Things can be going really good, and it can be destroyed in one round. It gives you adrenaline. That&apos;s why I think Counter-Strike is the best game ever.&quot;&#xA0; Coldzera tells me he hears a lot of the same stories from people like C&#xE9;sar; Brazilians who loved video games, and loved their country, and were brought into the fold by the team&apos;s collective excellence. Coldzera himself has a great respect for the first incarnation of MIBR. Today, casters have even coined a term for the team&apos;s deliberate, slow-paced gameplay. &quot;The Brazilian Style.&quot; You know you&apos;ve made it when you&apos;re part of an institution. MIBR lost in the semi-finals to Astralis, the eventual champions. When you look over the roster, you begin to see the glimmer of change on the horizon. Coldzera is 24, and both team captain Gabriel &quot;FalleN&quot; Toledo and Fernando &quot;fer&quot; Alvarenga will be 28 at the end of the year. They are still young by every conceivable measure except for esports, and while Counter-Strike is generally more friendly to the stringent burnout problems compared to other games, eventually a new generation of Brazilians will need to take up the banner. It&apos;s a hope that MIBR welcomes with open arms. None of these players would ever give up their spot without a fight, but throughout the weekend, I noticed that they displayed a remarkable solidarity with FURIA, another Brazilian Counter-Strike team who made it into the qualifying Challengers bracket. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mibr/status/1095727924592820224\"> #DiaDeFuria </a>, they tweeted, just before Valentine&apos;s Day, during one of their first matches of the tournament.) Furia showed well, but didn&apos;t finish with enough wins to move on to the next level where they may have had a date with MIBR. &#xA0;&quot;They just need more experience. They have a long road, but they&apos;re on the right road,&quot; says Coldzera. &quot;It&apos;s nice to see a new face for Brazil. &#x2026; It&apos;s crazy to see how they every tournament.&quot; Given that MIBR is the effective stand-in for Brazil&apos;s national team, I asked Coldzera what it&apos;d be like to someday go against a Brazilian team in a major tournament&#x2014;to have the throne challenged by someone in their backyard. As much as he cares for the future of his country&apos;s Counter-Strike scene, would it feel any different when he was staring that future in its eyes? &quot;That&apos;s gonna be nice,&quot; he laughs. &quot;Brazil wins, no matter who wins.&quot; ",

        "contents": "In my younger and more vulnerable years, I spent a lot of time getting shot in the head in Counter-Strike: Source. While there were many factors working against me - my age, my characteristic lack of dexterity, my (for the time) toaster-level PC, and my bargain-bin 200 DPI Dell laser mouse - I never let these disadvantages stop me from padding some lucky player's K/D ratio with my ill-fated MAC-10 rushes. When I would search through the list of servers for players of a similar skill level, I would come across a panoply of fan-made mods and maps intended to offer a respite from the endless dual grind of de_dust and cs_office, and I would occasionally take the plunge and sully my dad's hard-drive with these bizarre creations. Of these offerings, the most consistently-populated servers were always devoted to the act of \"surfing,\" a fact that boggled my pre-teen mind. When I would connect, I would see long, sloped ramps to nowhere, curling and twisting through empty space towards an unknown destination. While my opponents seemed to slide across the slope with ease, I would hurtle into the abyss every single time. No matter how loudly I pleaded with my fellow surfers to explain the trick, they would hurl obscenities at me and tell me to use F10 to deploy parachute - a button which would, in fact, abort the game. (To be fair, it was pretty funny the first time.) Later in life, I eventually figured out that holding a movement key against the slope allowed you to stick to the path, and I embraced surfing and other such \"trickjumping\" as a fun palate-cleanser at the end of a long night of gaming. Charlie \"Mariowned\" Joyce is the apparent inventor of the first surf map for Counter-Strike 1.6. Joyce confided this in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a4r4yz/whats_your_greatest_accomplishment_that_you_cant/\" target=\"_blank\">AskReddit thread</a> where people revealed their \"greatest accomplishment\" that they can't bring up in normal conversation, and he was immediately mobbed by fans of his work, and surfing in general. \"It was pretty overwhelming,\" he tells me. \"I thought I'd just get a couple of people saying, 'hey, I remember surfing, that's cool.' Or maybe, best-case scenario, reconnecting with an old buddy. But it was way, way more than that.\" <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-15-meet-the-guy-who-accidentally-invented-surf-maps-in-counter-strike\">Read more</a> ",

Popping over to <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/730\" target=\"_blank\">SteamCharts</a> and <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/730/graphs/\" target=\"_blank\">SteamDB</a> we can see the average and peak player numbers. On December 7, CS:GO shed its initial price and added the Danger Zone battle royale mode, causing a significant spike on the graphs.&#xA0; SteamCharts recorded an average player count of 395,509 during December with a peak of 746,548. November had 310,085 and 546,031. This does not, however, beat its record for concurrent players, which is over 850,000. Certainly, though, it&#x2019;s a big increase over the rest of the year, where CS:GO frequently averaged less than 300,000 concurrent players.&#xA0; A lot of people might be playing CS:GO right now, but they certainly weren&#x2019;t happy when Valve announced the changes. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\">CS:GO received 14,000 negative Steam reviews in a single day after going free-to-play</a>, and they kept rolling in. Many players were frustrated because they&#x2019;d already invested money into the game, and the gift of a loyalty badge didn&#x2019;t make them much happier.&#xA0; 7,000 positive reviews were also written, however, so there were plenty of optimistic players, too. It&#x2019;s also worth noting that after the dust settled, around a week after going free-to-play, the new positive reviews started outweighing the new negative reviews again. &#xA0; In the short term, it seems to have worked out, but a single month isn&#x2019;t much to go on. Did any of you lot take CS:GO for a spin because it went free-to-play? Let us know if you&#x2019;re going to be sticking around in the comments.&#xA0; Cheers, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-player-count\" target=\"_blank\">PCGamesN</a>.&#xA0; ",

You'd be hard-pressed to find a high street or city centre that doesn't have at least a couple of bookmakers' shops mixed into it, offering bets on everything from horse racing and football to whether or not Kate Winslet will cry if she wins an Oscar (yes that was a real thing). But how does esports fit in? According to a <a href=\"https://live-gamblecom.cloud.contensis.com/PDF/Virtual-currencies-eSports-and-social-casino-gaming.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">recent study by the UK's Gambling Commission</a>, the percentage of British adults who have at some point in their lives placed a bet on esports is 8.5 per cent, with three per cent having placed those bets in the month the study was conducted. That's a surprising statistic for a sport many consider to be still quite niche. And it makes sense most of those bets will be online, given the nature of esports and the audience for it. But it also got me wondering: just how easy it is to walk into a betting shop and wager some cash on an esports event? To find out, I picked three (at the time of betting) upcoming and current events to bet on, with the intention of gambling on three specific teams to win either the tournament or a particular match. These were Team Liquid to win the ESL One Dota 2 tournament, Ninjas in Pyjamas to win that day's ECS CS:GO season six game, and for the Overwatch World Cup, I had to back the home nation and bet on the UK. Secondly, I decided I had to be able to place the bet in store. We all know you can bet on esports online, so that didn't count. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-13-how-uk-bookies-are-handling-the-rising-influence-of-esports\">Read more&hellip;</a> ",

The fun and games began when YouTube user snaileny posted a video of a \"strange broadcast\" they'd found on the new battle royale map dz_blacksite.

The mode accommodates 16 players in singles, and 18 players in duos or triples. Danger Zone features the same weapon behavior and damage as conventional CS:GO, Valve says. Like CS:GO, the matches are short, lasting about 10 minutes. It makes many other changes to CS:GO&apos;s systems: * Each player carries an upgradeable special tablet device (on Tab) for tracking other players and accessing a limited buy menu; * You start with just a knife&#x2014;aerial delivery drones ferry purchased weapons and equipment directly to your position; * Each player publicly claims a landing zone before rappelling into the match; * Cash can be found in the environment and you can also bring hostages to rescue zones; * There&apos;s currently one map, called Blacksite - it&apos;s small by Battle Royale standards, but big for Counter-Strike&#xA0;; * The map is divided into hexagonal zones, which are randomly, occasionally bombarded by an airstrike; * Ammo is scarce: even purchased weapons are handed to you with almost no ammo in them; * Your weapon skins from the base game are carried into Danger Zone; From the round I&apos;ve played so far, it&apos;s weird to see a bunch of old weapons and new ideas thrown together into the same pot. Some of the engagement ranges on the single map, Blacksite, are absolutely enormous by CS standards. Grabbing wads off cash off of the ground (or in locked safes that you have to destroy with C4) feels out of place so far. CS:GO does have its exclusively first-person perspective going for it, at least. Meanwhile, in all modes of CS:GO, players will now be separated into two matchmaking groups: Prime and non-prime. If you already owned CS:GO, you&apos;re a Prime player. &quot;When you have Prime Status you are matched with other players who also have Prime Status, and Prime users are eligible for Prime-exclusive souvenir items, item drops, and weapon cases.&quot; Danger Zone arrives, of course, with 17 new seasonal weapon skins. CS:GO going free-to-play signifies, in part, that Valve is confident in the game&apos;s current anticheat solution, delivered through a Valve-built machine learning system called <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/vacnet-csgo/\" target=\"_blank\">VACnet</a>.&#xA0;As far as I can tell, any banned CS:GO player could join the game through a new Steam account, but would not be matched with other Prime players. It&apos;s unclear how CS:GO matchmakes mixed parties of Prime and free players. ",

Where previously we voted for our favourite games, this year we talked: discussing each of our nominations and deciding which games should make the list. The result is a more honest, considered reflection of our conflicting tastes and opinions as PC gamers. This list represents what we think are the greatest PC games you can play today. We wanted to celebrate the breadth and variety of PC gaming, and so, for the most part, have restricted ourselves to one game per series. You&apos;ll also find a selection of personal picks: games we individually love that didn&apos;t quite make the cut. Enjoy! If you&apos;re looking for a list of the games that helped shape PC gaming as we know it, try the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/most-important-pc-games/\" target=\"_blank\">50 most important PC games of all time</a>. 100. Path of Exile <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Steven Messner:</strong> Path of Exile has quietly become one of the best action RPGs around thanks to its almost incomprehensible depth and wildly different seasonal leagues, where whole new systems are introduced. But the best part is its character customisation and spell crafting system. Path of Exile encourages players to make marauders who let spell totems do all the killing for them, witches who melt hordes with a fiery beam, or duelists that cover every inch of the map in a deadly rain of arrows. 99. Twisted Insurrection <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>John Strike:</strong> Tiberian Sun&apos;s best mod brazenly shames the original Firestorm expansion in almost every way. It&#x2019;s bigger and bolder, offering new buildings, a whole fleet of new units and even a new faction. There&#x2019;s a completely new musical score and dozens of single player missions, some of which are based on the original Command &amp; Conquer. Not only are new missions and units still being added, but, as a standalone free download, it&apos;s the most accessible way to play one of C&amp;C&apos;s greats. 98. Killing Floor 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 81 <strong>Evan Lahti: </strong>There are disturbingly few places in video games where I can cut an evil clown in half with a quad-barrelled shotgun. Killing Floor 2 is the world&#x2019;s greatest gore effects system laid atop an enjoyable skeleton. Hordes of monsters trickle into the map, magnetized to your position, and you mulch them with buzzsaw-spitters, incendiary shotguns, rocket launchers, or a microwave cannon that heats enemies from the inside until they burst. The dynamic slow-mo system adds so much, dampening the chaos just enough&#x2014;granting extra moments to take aim or take in the sight of an intestine flying across the screen. Tripwire is a skilled digital gunsmith, and the detail lent to particle effects and reload animations holds up wonderfully even under the scrutiny of these plentiful, slowed-down sequences. I also love that KF2 doesn&#x2019;t simply make these mutants into bullet sponges. On higher difficulties, enemies adopt different behavioral triggers that make them genuinely harder to handle. <strong>Wes Fenlon:</strong> The precision and teamwork it takes to play Killing Floor 2 at higher difficulties is especially thrilling. Also, I once played a community map that was monochrome purple and themed after Game Boy-era Pok&#xE9;mon. It was pretty bad, but I appreciated the option. 97. Night in the Woods <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Phil Savage:</strong> A coming-of-age platformer starring an anthropomorphic cat returning home to a dead-end town after dropping out of college. On paper, Night in the Woods sounds like it could be intolerable, but its relationships are so well developed&#x2014;so warm and fraught and human&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s impossible not to get drawn into Mae&apos;s world, and to want the best for her and her friends. I particularly love the frequent use of minigames as a way to highlight the need to escape the monotony of day-to-day responsibility. <strong>Andy Kelly: </strong>A beautiful, heartfelt story brought to life by flawed, nuanced characters who just happen to be talking animals. It says something about life, but always knows when to crack a joke&#x2014;and always with perfect timing&#x2014;when things get too heavy. 96. Deadly Premonition: The Director&apos;s Cut <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Philippa Warr: </strong>Deadly Premonition is always a gamble of a recommendation. It&apos;s a gamble worth taking, though, because if you get on with its strangeness and its idiosyncrasies, it rewards you with a weird and beautiful experience of a kind you don&apos;t often get in gaming. Yes, the cars handle horribly. Yes, the PC version has crashed on me extensively. Yes, it starts off more as an irritating pastiche of Twin Peaks. Yes, it has frustrating quicktime events. And yes, some reveals draw uncomfortably on lazy tropes. But within that is a supernatural-tinged mystery that alternates between survival horror third-person shooter and a horror comedy investigation. None of the game&apos;s shortcomings were dealbreakers for me and several of the characters I encountered as I hunted for the Raincoat Killer have stayed with me for the best part of a decade. <strong>Wes:</strong> The jank may be part of the charm, but at least make sure you install Durante&apos;s DPFix, which lets you select resolutions above 720p and fixes many minor graphical issues&#x2014;mitigating some of the PC port&#x2019;s shortcomings. 95. Stick Shift <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Pip:</strong> Stick Shift is my go-to example of a game which invokes complex subject matter while also being really fun to play. As per developer Robert Yang&apos;s description: &quot;Stick Shift is an autoerotic night-driving game about pleasuring a gay car.&quot; It&apos;s part of a trilogy alongside Hurt Me Plenty and Succulent, and together they explore aspects of eroticism, consent, arousal, politics and more. It&apos;s also a game where you move your mouse rhythmically, working your car to a climax. 94. Elite Dangerous <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Phil:</strong> Frontier&apos;s galactic sandbox treads a fine line between excitement and tedium. Aliens! Dogfights! Smuggling! Interdictions! Ferrying pesticides to an outpost six lightyears away! However you decide to play, though&#x2014;whatever amount of excitement you desire&#x2014;Elite is still a masterfully crafted spaceship simulator. I love the design and feel of its ships, particularly the holographic UI and peerless sci-fi sound design. The thrill of warping to another solar system is never entirely diminished, meaning Elite remains entertaining even if you&#x2019;ve chosen the life of a glorified space trucker. <strong>Andy: </strong>Whether it&apos;s a chunky cargo hauler or a nimble fighter, every starship in Elite has its own distinct personality. They&apos;re all a delight to fly. Even the most mundane task feels wonderfully tactile. 93. Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Andy:</strong> While the original Ni no Kuni was co-designed by Spirited Away creator Studio Ghibli, it wasn&apos;t involved in this sequel. But developer Level-5 has done fine on its own, creating a rich fantasy world with a cast of vivid characters worthy of the Ghibli name. This is a sweeping JRPG about an usurped boy king on a quest to rebuild his kingdom and reclaim his throne. It&apos;s also one of the most colourful, vibrant games on PC. <strong>Wes:</strong> The cutscenes are remarkably Ghibli and full of pep and puns, but what really made me fall for Ni No Kuni 2 is just how many systems it layers atop systems, like a big-budget JRPG of old. The sprawling kingdom builder is the centerpiece, with characters to recruit and buildings to construct and upgrade. 92. Mu Cartographer <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Pip:</strong> Mu Cartographer is initially obtuse. You&apos;ll probably feel utterly lost as to what you&#x2019;re supposed to do for a while. But once you start tinkering with all the different buttons and dials on the interface you begin to see how to explore the strange map. The peaks and troughs of digital noise on your display suddenly turn into recognisable shapes as you tweak the settings and find the sweet spot. Stepped pyramids rise up where seconds ago all you could see was a fuzzy mess. 91. Guild Wars 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 86 <strong>Phil:</strong> Guild Wars 2 is full of clever quality-of-life features&#x2014;it&apos;s still one of the few MMOs that&apos;s figured out how to let you easily play with friends of a different level. The flow and pace of its maps are a thing of beauty, too. Groups expand and contract naturally, as people wander off to explore on their own, before coming together for a small-scale event or organising to complete a single map-wide objective. You get all the joy of cooperation without the need to commit a significant amount of your time. Just turn up and play. Then, when you eventually get tired, go off and do something else. There&apos;s also no subscription, and none of the expansions have raised the level cap, so you&apos;re free to come and go as you please, playing at your own pace without ever worrying that you&apos;re falling behind. You can play for hours every week if you want&#x2014;ticking off the hardest achievements and earning the rarest loot&#x2014;but I&apos;m happy to log back in every six months or so, safe in the knowledge that I&apos;m ready for whatever&apos;s next. <strong>Tom:</strong> I have fought huge dragon bosses and a marionette the size of a skyscraper, and I didn&apos;t need to grind for 200 hours for the privilege. Guild Wars 2 earnestly tries to reinvent the MMO by reshaping the bullshit grinding and levelling systems that had become rote in the genre. 90. Super Mega Baseball 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Wes: </strong>I&apos;m about as bad at this surprisingly deep baseball game as I am at real baseball, but as a lapsed fan of America&apos;s pastime I appreciate how good this rendition is. It walks the line between a hyper-detailed sports sim and an arcadey NBA Jam-like, with simple controls but tons of nuance in pitching and hitting. <strong>Chris Livingston:</strong> The customization is great, letting you change everything from player abilities to team logos, and its Pennant Race mode makes every online game feel important. 89. The Stanley Parable <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Samuel Roberts: </strong>You start in an abandoned office with a narrator telling you what you&apos;re supposed to do next. If you obey his instructions it will lead you to an ending. But if you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll discover many more fascinating, exciting little stories. <strong>Phil: </strong>An antagonistic dialogue between a man with no body and another with no voice. Weird, funny and full of ideas. <strong>Pip:</strong> Games often struggle with comedy. The Stanley Parable manages to be consistently funny as well as whip smart. 88. Drawful 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Wes:</strong> A chill, surprisingly hilarious party game I can play for hours. Everyone joins in on a smartphone and gets a phrase to draw on the touchscreen, then writes their own descriptions of everyone else&apos;s drawing to trick the crowd or simply get the most laughs. It&apos;s like millennial Pictionary, so inevitably people draw a lot more dicks. 87. Nidhogg 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>James Davenport:</strong> The back-and-forth struggles of Nidhogg were already unpredictable, but bows, axes, swords, and daggers transform simple fencing standoffs into tense, sweaty battles for control. Nidhogg 2 is an excellent way to graft friends to the couch.&#xA0; <strong>Evan: </strong>A see-sawing melee mess. No PC game produces more smile-yelling than Nidhogg 2. 86. Stephen&apos;s Sausage Roll <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Pip:</strong> Stephen&apos;s Sausage Roll and I are on a break. I can&apos;t remember exactly why, but I know that I definitely rage-quit the sausage-grilling puzzler a while ago and haven&apos;t become sufficiently not angry to go back. That isn&apos;t a criticism, though; this is the puzzle game I recommend to the friends who want a real challenge. <strong>Phil:</strong> I managed one level. 85. Battletech <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Evan:</strong> It&apos;s turn-based MMA with walking tanks. Unlike XCOM 2, the durability and modular design of mechs makes for drawn out, back-and-forth exchanges that become micro-stories of attrition and mettle. You trade blows with an Atlas, weave and evade it, it cleaves off one of your body segments, you circle around, knock it down and KO it with a face stomp. I love BattleTech&apos;s degrees of failure. You might complete all objectives but lose your rare, damage-boosted PPC, put a pilot in a two-month coma, or have to spend every nickel you just earned fixing up your battered Highlander. The campaign wrapped around BattleTech&apos;s granular combat is a bottomless well of procedurally generated missions with a heartwarming story of underdog regal revenge at its nucleus. 84. Football Manager 2018 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Joe Donnelly:</strong> Following some less comprehensive annual instalments, Football Manager 2018 gives us the most sophisticated soccer management simulation yet, where success is no longer determined by match performance alone. Piss off the wrong combination of players, and you&apos;ll risk a dressing room revolt. Suck up to the most popular, and you&apos;ll isolate your fringe stars. You need to balance influence and social standings to prevent the beautiful game from turning ugly. 83. Thumper <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 34 <strong>Pip: </strong>I don&apos;t think many people can consciously identify a &apos;fast-moving rhythm action space beetle combat game with a heady metal album aesthetic&apos; void in their lives. But it exists and Thumper can fix it. <strong>Phil:</strong> The dark, grungy synths and unusual time signatures create a fascinatingly ominous soundscape that draws you into the claustrophobic, reactive action. Thumper offers a mesmerising blend of palpable dread and empowering mastery&#x2014;at least it did for me until the later levels, which required a degree of dexterity I&apos;m not sure I possess. <strong>James: </strong>That scarab scrapes down the interdimensional highway at the centre of Thumper with so much speed and ferocity that the game almost literally breaks apart by the end. Nod your head to dull the pain.&#xA0; 82. Euro Truck Simulator 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 89 <strong>Andy:</strong> The problem with simulators is that they&apos;re often badly designed, technically janky or both. But Euro Truck Simulator 2 is neither of these things. This is a deep, polished, and immensely playable driving game set in a vast, mostly accurate replica of Europe. You can drive seamlessly between countries, and there&apos;s an understated beauty to the scenery that passes you by. It&apos;s also incredibly atmospheric, especially at night or in the rain. There&apos;s no better game to play while listening to music or catching up on podcasts, and it&apos;s deeply customisable too, meaning you can make each road trip as realistic or accessible as you like, depending on how deep you want the simulation to be. <strong>Phil:</strong> In many ways I prefer American Truck Simulator. That&apos;s not because I love weigh stations&#x2014;they&apos;re fine, if that&apos;s your thing&#x2014;but because America&apos;s vast, terrifying emptiness feels more isolated, more epic, and, dare I say, more romantic. Euro Truck Simulator 2, on the other hand, is dense and busy, but also muted&#x2014;it&apos;s altogether greyer and more moodily atmospheric. Both games are fantastic, and which one you prefer is likely a matter of which style of road trip speaks more to your personality. How many simulation games can you say that of? 81. FTL: Faster Than Light&#xA0; <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 21 <strong>Samuel:</strong> It turns out being the captain of your own spaceship is stressful as hell, but you&apos;ll take part in some great stories along the way. FTL is a superior mix of roguelike and strategy. While Into The Breach is taking its place in my life, this is still one of the best space-set games around.&#xA0; <strong>Wes: </strong>It can make for a great party game, too. Put someone in the driver&apos;s seat and let the crowd make choices. Suddenly half your ship is on fire and you&apos;ve accidentally vented one of your crew into space. 80. Stalker: Call of Pripyat <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 41 <strong>Chris:</strong> This grim and unforgiving open world FPS never turns you into an invincible superhero. No matter how much gear and weaponry you scrounge from the irradiated exclusion zone, you&apos;re still mortal and fragile, alone in a terrifying world of mutants, monsters, and roaming factions of AI-controlled humans. This lends Stalker an unending tension and fills every encounter with dread. From start to finish, there&apos;s a sense that at any moment you could meet your unceremonious end. 79. Doom 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 1994 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 76 <strong>Wes:</strong> People are making mods and maps for this game like it was released a year ago. That&apos;s awesome. But what really strikes me about Doom 2 is how fun it still is, and how different it feels from decades more advanced shooters. There&apos;s a purity in how it moves, how it sounds and the minimum frames of animation it takes to sell firing the super shotgun. 78. Grim Fandango Remastered <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 96 <strong>Pip: </strong>Twenty years after its initial release it&apos;s still a real pleasure to revisit the film noir world of Manny Calavera, travel agent of the afterlife. Nowadays I play purely for the story so I keep online hints at hand for when progress stalls. <strong>Tom Senior: </strong>Shout out here to Glottis, the giant orange demon who&apos;s too big and happy to quite fit into the world he&#x2019;s in. 77. Warhammer: Vermintide 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Samuel:</strong> There&apos;s a long tail to Vermintide 2 if you&apos;re willing to stick with this four-player Left 4 Dead-alike set in the Warhammer universe. It looks prettier than the first game, offers more in-depth character progression, and has much better combat. <strong>Phil: </strong>It feels really good to stab up a rat, and if that&apos;s not worth a spot on this list, I&apos;d love to know what is. 76. Oxenfree <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Samuel: </strong>This spooky adventure game has a group of young friends inadvertently unlock a supernatural force on a haunted island. The relationships and various tensions between all the characters feel very real, and the dialogue is funny and poignant. These characters feel like they could&apos;ve been people I went to school with. <strong>Phil: </strong>The snappy, fun dialogue makes Oxenfree feel more theatrical than realistic, but that fits perfectly with the eerie mystery and interpersonal drama. 75. Regency Solitaire <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Pip:</strong> I added Grey Alien&apos;s card-game-slash-Regency-romance to our Top 100 discussion list, then reinstalled the game and spent three hours of the Top 100 discussion playing this in the background. I&apos;m fighting the urge to play it again now instead of finishing this incredibly short paragraph about why it&apos;s good. The solitaire aspect is really strong, it&apos;s super easy to play just one more round, and the story is light but charming. Are we done? Can I boot it up again? 74. Metro: Last Light Redux <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 95 <strong>Tom:</strong> Not many shooters have you frantically pumping up a pneumatic gun before you can fire it, but that&#x2019;s Metro for you. These ramshackle weapons carry you through a filthy, atmospheric corridor shooter set in the depths of the Moscow undercity. The tunnels hide mutant creatures and nests of horrible spidery things, but the most dangerous enemies are the human clans trying to scrape out a living in the post-apocalypse. <strong>Samuel: </strong>A beautiful and grim FPS that&apos;s refreshingly bleak for a modern triple-A game. The world building in Metro: Last Light is dazzling to me&#x2014;the little snapshots of human civilisation that show how there are children in these underground settlements who never knew the world before it got into this bleak, decrepit state. And the story features some unforgettable moments, such as an early flashback that shows&#x2014;from the perspective of the pilots&#x2014;how a passenger plane was destroyed in the nuclear blast. It&apos;s a chilling world that&apos;s hard work just to exist in, but I love that it&apos;s a post-apocalyptic setting that doesn&#x2019;t succumb to the desire to over-stylise anything. It commits to showing the horrors of what a nuclear war would do to the modern world, and I&apos;d recommend it to absolutely anyone. 73. Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 40 <strong>Steven: </strong>Square Enix&apos;s from-the-ashes MMO enjoyed another stellar year following the release of Stormblood, a revolution-themed expansion that whisks players across the sea to Eastern-inspired worlds that add much richness to an already great story. Though its endgame has become a predictable grind at this point, Final Fantasy 14 is still able to keep things exciting thanks to the steady pace of new bosses, dungeons, and raids to clear. Each one is just as memorable as the last thanks to a stunning soundtrack and beautiful world design. 72. The Norwood Suite&#xA0; <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Pip: </strong>Cosmo D&apos;s first-person jazz hotel exploration has you poking around a converted mansion and uncovering the secrets of its former owner, celebrated pianist, Peter Norwood. Musicality shapes the whole experience, warping the space and affecting the denizens. As you dig around you&apos;ll also discover the game&apos;s sense of humour via visual gags and surreal chats with guests and visitors. For a related experience you should also check out the developer&#x2019;s free game, Off-Peak. 71. Mount &amp; Blade: Warband <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Evan:</strong> Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is what we so often clamour for: an RPG where you&apos;re not an intergalactic savior or chosen one, but just some dude leading a small army on a sprawling, simulated map filled with other dudes leading other armies. It&apos;s sandbox in the truest sense, and the feeling of loosing an arrow into a line of galloping cavalry still holds up. <strong>Phil: </strong>You start with nothing: left for dead in a town with few weapons, no supplies and barely any gold. From such inauspicious beginnings, you&apos;re free to do just about anything. Hunt bandits, befriend lords, rob pretty much anyone. Or, if you don&apos;t fancy leading hundreds of soldiers, just go fight for prestige in the arena. We&apos;ve been waiting years for Mount &amp; Blade 2, but Warband still has much to offer. 70. StarCraft 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Andy:</strong> Across its three campaigns, StarCraft 2 boasts some of the best, most cinematic single-player RTS missions on PC. New challenges are constantly being thrown at you, forcing you to try new units and tactics, and the story isn&apos;t bad either. When you&apos;re done with all that, you can take your newfound skills online, which still has a huge and dedicated following. There&apos;s a bottomless pit of tips, tutorials, and strategies online, meaning new players have a decent chance of catching up. 69. Galactic Civilizations 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2011 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Tom: </strong>Maybe a game like Stellaris will knock this classic spacebound 4X strategy game out of the Top 100, but not this year. It&apos;s hard to beat a game that&apos;s so smart and complete, and that can generate so much strategic intrigue with every campaign. The AI is so cunning that former PC Gamer staffer-turned-developer Tom Francis once wrote an entire book about one of his attempts to thwart it. Singleplayer games don&apos;t get much deeper than this. 68. Prison Architect <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Chris:</strong> There&apos;s an engrossing amount of depth to the management simulation of Prison Architect, where building a workshop for inmates to make license plates doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ll just walk in and begin working. First they&apos;ll need training, which requires classrooms, which require instructors, who require work and class schedules and their own facilities. Oh, and metal detectors to make sure the inmates don&apos;t smuggle out tools to use as weapons against guards or other inmates, or to tunnel under the walls of your prison. It&apos;s not easy building and managing a small city where most of the population is plotting escape. <strong>Andy:</strong> I love it when things go to shit in management sims, and Prison Architect is enormously fun to watch (and manage) when disaster inevitably strikes. A streak of black comedy runs through the game, and there&apos;s something darkly hilarious about a riot erupting&#x2014;these cartoonish little characters shivving each other, starting fires and beating up guards. Something as simple as a fight in the canteen can be the flashpoint for a full-scale riot, and trying to suppress it safely and quickly is a real test of skill. But that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t have some fun observing the chaos before rolling your sleeves up and stepping in to deal with it. 67. Ori and the Blind Forest <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 62 <strong>Pip:</strong> An adorable Ghibli-esque aesthetic&#x2014;particularly the opening cutscene&#x2014;gives way to a rock hard Metroidvania platformer. Your eyes are as likely to tear up with emotion as they are with absolute fury if you fail a boss one too many times.&#xA0; <strong>Tom: </strong>It looks like sugar but tastes like salt. Ori is not the moonlit animal paradise it appears to be at first glance. It&#x2019;s a game about loss, revenge, and bastard-hard jumping challenges. The art is absolutely gorgeous. It&apos;s a hazy, dreamlike world of artfully twisted overgrowth and spike pits. The movement is so quick, precise and responsive I just want to squeeze it, even as it stabs me repeatedly in the heart. Approach with caution and keep some hankies and a swear jar within reach. 66. Frostpunk <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Chris:</strong> A survival and crisis management sim about building and sustaining city in a frozen world. In addition to providing food, warmth, and shelter to your citizens, you have to provide them something much trickier: hope for the future. That&apos;s immensely difficult when people are starving, freezing, and working themselves to death under your direction, and the choices you face are grim ones that never leave you feeling like a hero, even when things work out. Frostpunk is a game that asks two questions: &apos;How far are you willing to go to save lives?&apos; And, &apos;No, really, how far are you willing to go?&apos; It&apos;s a masterful exploration of the burden of leadership, the true costs of survival, and the balancing act between guiding your citizens and controlling them. 65. Diablo 3 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 30 <strong>Tom:</strong> &apos;Maybe I should start another Crusader run&apos;: seven words that could take up 60 hours of my life. Diablo 3 is still a stellar action RPG that has only become more generous year on year after its unsteady and controversial launch. The necromancer is a fantastic addition that calls back to Diablo 2 without nostalgically retreading the same ground. If you want to smash up thousands of monsters for gold and loot, there aren&apos;t many games that do it as well as Diablo 3. 64. Bayonetta <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 32 <strong>Samuel:</strong> A superb hack-and-slash game that rewards mastery with feeling like a badass. It&apos;s pretty much the first place I&apos;d send anyone new to this genre of game that has its modern roots in Capcom&apos;s Devil May Cry series. This, from that game&apos;s creator, is funny, stylish and satisfying to learn. Its sequel, which Nintendo published, doesn&apos;t come close to matching the original. The range of weapons here fits together perfectly. <strong>Phil:</strong> The fast-paced combat is yet to be bettered, and the world and story are equal parts stylish and absurd. 63. Crypt of the Necrodancer <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Pip: </strong>The rhythm combat in this game is so polished that I love it even when it&apos;s at its most stressful. You have to move on every beat or risk losing your cash multiplier, which means there&apos;s no downtime to plan your next move. Is a multiplier all that important, you ask? &quot;Oh,&quot; I reply, &quot;Only if you want to keep being able to afford new items at the shop where the amazingly catchy soundtrack is suddenly given an EVEN MORE AMAZING operatic flavour thanks to a singing shopkeeper called Freddie Merchantry.&quot; <strong>Wes:</strong> This would be a great roguelike in its own right, but it&apos;s almost unfair how cleverly the musical element is threaded through exploration and combat. Try dungeon dancing to your own music for a new challenge. 62. Sunless Sea <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 75 <strong>Pip:</strong> I bounced off Sunless Sea so hard when it first came out&#x2014;I remember clunky combat and irritating resource grind as core objections. Returning to the game with the Zubmariner DLC I found myself well and truly suckered in&#x2014;devoting hours to pottering away in the Unterzee, drinking in Failbetter&apos;s expert prose and luxuriating in the art style. Sunless Skies is shaping up to be another step forward so I&apos;m singing Sunless Sea&apos;s praises now, lest seas be eclipsed by skies in the near future! 61. Baldur&apos;s Gate 2: Enhanced Edition <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 48 <strong>Tom: </strong>Baldur&apos;s Gate 2 is still a magnificent achievement. Few RPGs since have been as broad, deep or fully featured as this sprawling classic. Pillars of Eternity and other games are steadily bringing the classic RPG back to prominence, but Baldur&apos;s Gate 2 is still very much worth playing today, and is still one of the most faithful videogame interpretations of D&amp;D&apos;s Forgotten Realms setting. It&apos;s a great party RPG too. Few modern games would be brave enough to implement a morality system that ca...",

The crash occurred on a freeway in San Diego shortly after 4:30 pm local time Thursday. Heitmann&apos;s 2014 McLaren 650s, traveling at more than 100 mph in the wrong direction, according to police, collided with a Hyundai SUV, killing its driver, a 43-year-old woman, and its passenger, a 12-year-old girl.&#xA0; &quot;The sports car was traveling southbound in the northbound I-805 carpool lane at a high rate of speed when it hit a 2010 Hyundai SUV traveling northbound on I-805 near La Jolla Village Drive, according to CHP and the San Diego County Medical Examiner&apos;s Office,&quot; writes <a href=\"https://fox5sandiego.com/2018/08/24/12-year-old-girl-among-3-victims-killed-in-fiery-i-805-crash/\"> FOX 5 San Diego </a>.&#xA0; Heitmann showed the vehicle to his audience in a December 2017 YouTube video embedded below. Eight vehicles in total were involved in the collision according to California Highway Patrol. The McLaren can be seen charred and destroyed in news footage, apparently engulfing in flames as a result of the impact. Witnesses told police that about a half an hour earlier the <a href=\"https://fox5sandiego.com/2018/08/23/speeding-sports-car-crashes-through-elementary-school-gate/\">black McLaren smashed through a fence</a>&#xA0;at a local elementary school and drove away at high speed. Heitmann&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OGMCSKILLET/videos\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube account</a> has more than 877,000 subscribers. His videos are focused heavily on CS:GO&apos;s cosmetic items and market, often promoting skin gambling websites such as CSGOEmpire.com and CSGOroll.com. ",

The MP5, a submachinegun that has been a fixture throughout the Counter-Strike series, appears in a short video set in the map de_train in the clip above, being picked up and admired by a player. The MP5, while not known for great range or damage, is still celebrated for its affordability and availability to both teams, making it a popular choice in early CS rounds. It has never appeared in Global Offensive, having essentially been replaced by the MP7 up until this point. Looks like it will finally arrive in CS:GO, though we don&apos;t yet know when. It&apos;ll be interesting to see how the MP5 fits into CS:GO&apos;s plentiful set of SMGs.

        "contents": "We all know that playing online with other random humans can be a pain, and apparently Ubisoft got plenty sick of watching players spew <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-toxicity-ban/\"> racist language in Rainbow Six: Siege </a>. The developer instituted a system that automatically bans players who enter racial slurs into the game chat, which has resulted in plenty of outrage.&#xA0; If Ubisoft can make life tough for these people, what are the other major multiplayer games doing to combat racism in their games? We checked in with Blizzard, Valve, and other developers to see how they deal with racial slurs, and what they do to the players who use them. League of Legends <strong>How does Riot police harassment?</strong> Of all the games on this list, League of Legends might have the most extensive code of conduct, known formally as the &#x201C;<a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/#toc\"> Summoner&#x2019;s Code </a>.&#x201D; League&#x2019;s &#x201C;Instant Feedback System&#x201D; has seen some reforms, but it basically scours through the game&#x2019;s chat logs after someone submits a player report, then doles out a verdict in 15 minutes or less, or your pizza is free. The first offense gets you a 10-game chat restriction, then a 25-game chat restriction, then a two week ban, and finally a permanent ban. Offending players even get a pleasant little in-game message about why they&#x2019;re getting the hammer. <strong>How do well-behaved players fight back?</strong> Players can <a href=\"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player\"> submit a report </a> against someone at the end of a game, and the Instant Feedback System should get a verdict within 15 minutes. Sometimes, but not always, players will be notified if their report resulted in the punishment of another player, but Riot says that even if you don&apos;t get a message, that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean the other player got off scot free. &#x201C;We want a future where League is wholly free of slurs and hate speech, but penalties alone won&#x2019;t get us there,&quot; said Riot senior technical designer Kimberly Voll in a statement to PC Gamer. &quot;In recent years, we&#x2019;ve been focusing more on the establishment of norms. We believe if there aren&#x2019;t clear, understood, and shared rules on what&#x2019;s OK in gaming, like there are in sports, then we&#x2019;ll just be enforcing the same nasty things forever. Like Jeff Kaplan mentioned on behalf of Overwatch last year, enforcement alone stretches budgets. We agree, and believe it limits our imagination and audience as well.&#x201D; Fortnite <strong>How does Epic Games police harassment?</strong> It&#x2019;s unclear how extensive punishments for abusive players are in Fortnite. Search online and you&#x2019;ll find far more forum posts about temporary or permanent bans for players who break the rules by teaming up in solo mode than for harassment. There&#x2019;s no text chat, just a voice chat system that&#x2019;s push-to-talk by default for communication with your squadmates. Epic&#x2019;s primary focus seems to be on cheaters, going so far as to file a lawsuit against two more prominent <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/epic-sues-two-fortnite-cheaters/\"> players </a>. Fortnite&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-code-of-conduct\"> code of conduct </a> page does warn players to &#x201C;be graceful in victory and defeat.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;Discriminatory language, hate speech, threats, spam, and other forms of harassment or illegal behavior will not be tolerated,&#x201D; it reads. PC Gamer has reached out to Epic for a more thorough explanation of how their system works, but has yet to receive a reply. <strong>How do well-behaved players fight back?</strong> Fortnite has a typical system wherein you can report the player who killed you in the post-death menu. If you need to report another player or your own teammates, the report function is squirreled away in the &#x201C;feedback&#x201D; menu option, and you need to be able to supply that player&#x2019;s username. Epic has also invited players to use their <a href=\"https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/\"> support center </a> for bigger issues.&#xA0; Dota 2 <strong>How does Valve police harassment?</strong> Valve operates on a typical system where more reports get you banned for longer periods of time. The lower rung of bans can be as short as 10 minutes to an hour. You&#x2019;ll get a day-long ban if things get a bit more serious. And if you&#x2019;re a real jerk, you&#x2019;ll get a week, then a month or two, and finally a six month or permanent ban. Valve deliberately keeps this process vague, but it does warn abusive players ahead of time that continued bad behavior will result in longer bans. <strong>How do well-behaved players fight back?</strong> Valve has a pretty typical report system in place, but it&#x2019;s basically only available at the end of a match. Players can pick from three categories (communication abuse, intentional ability abuse, and intentional feeding) and can leave a brief comment. You can leave up to three reports per week, and you&#x2019;ll be notified if any action is taken against another player you reported. PlayerUnknown&#x2019;s Battlegrounds <strong>How does PUBG Corporation police harassment?</strong> If a PUBG player is caught harassing another player with racist or sexist language, they will first receive a three-day ban. A second incident will net a full week, and a third incident will net a full month. Any repeat offenses beyond that will earn a player a permanent ban. You can look at the <a href=\"https://www.pubg.com/rules-of-conduct/\"> comprehensive chart </a> for a better idea of how other issues are tackled. &#x201C;It is unacceptable to disrespect or use offensive words towards others based on their race, gender, nationality, etc,&#x201D; the code of conduct reads. <strong>How do well-behaved players fight back?</strong> There&#x2019;s currently no way for someone to report another player who didn&#x2019;t kill them, which makes reporting racist behavior a pain. PUBG representatives have said that players must <a href=\"https://support.playbattlegrounds.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002102034-Reporting-Cheaters-Hackers-Teamkillers\"> submit a report </a> on the PUBG forums that includes the reporting player&#x2019;s username, the name of the player you&#x2019;re reporting, the time and date of the incident, and a description of the incident. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be the guy sifting through all that footage. PUBG allows you to directly report auser after they&#x2019;ve killed you, although the closest category available for racial discrimination would be &#x201C;improper nickname.&#x201D; This feedback system is clearly not designed for combating harassment. CS:GO <strong>How does Valve police harassment?</strong> Although CS:GO uses one of the most effective automated systems for shutting down cheaters, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/vacnet-csgo/\"> VACnet </a>, it does not currently automatically ban or silence players who use racist language. VACnet and its accompanying <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/\"> &quot;Overwatch&quot; </a> system are primarily focused on catching hackers and griefers. The Overwatch system recruits experienced players with good records, then gives them the tools to review footage of reported matches, and it&#x2019;s up to them to give a collective verdict. If a player is caught being awful, they receive either a &#x201C;minorly disruptive&#x201D; or &#x201C;majorly disruptive&#x201D; designation. The first results in a ban of &#x201C;at least 30 days,&#x201D; but a second offense gets a lifetime ban. A &#x201C;majorly disruptive&#x201D; designation automatically gets you a permanent ban, but Valve&#x2019;s description only mentions cheating, not abusive behavior. There&#x2019;s no mention of racism, sexism, or general verbal abuse in Valve&#x2019;s descriptions of Overwatch or VACnet, so it&#x2019;s unclear if the company has any major initiative against harassment other than the mute and report buttons. We reached out to Valve for clarification on how its process works, but did not receive a reply by publishing time. <strong>How do well-behaved players fight back?</strong> Players can select another player during a match, which opens up an option to report or commend them. Abusive text and voice chat sit comfortably at the top of the list of options. You can also mute the player by checking the &#x201C;block communications&#x201D; box. Rocket League <strong>How does Psyonix police harassment?</strong> Rocket League might be the closest to Rainbow Six: Siege in terms of automating bans for racial slurs. Back in 2017, Psyonix <a href=\"https://www.rocketleague.com/news/new-ban-practices-season-4-rewards-update/\"> instituted a secret list of 20 words </a> and variants that can trigger bans. Psyonix says each word has a certain threshold, and once that&#x2019;s met, multiplayer bans will start at 24 hours, then 72 hours, a week, and finally a permanent ban. Psyonix also has a <a href=\"https://www.rocketleague.com/news/tournaments-update-chat-ban-system-details/\"> chat ban </a> system in place that, well, bans jerks from using the text chat window. It&#x2019;s a little more lenient than the general language ban system, but players have to report the abuse (rather than the game auto-scanning), then the system scans the game that was just played for abusive language. If a reported player is found guilty, they&apos;re banned from chatting for 24 hours to one month. It&#x2019;s not instant like Rainbow Six Siege&#x2019;s. If a player insists on using abusive language after their initial chat ban is up, they &#x201C;may&#x201D; get a permanent overall game ban. Players who get chat bans are notified whenever it happens. <strong>How do well-behaved players fight back?</strong> Rocket League&apos;s reporting mechanism is straightforward. You just click on the offending player&#x2019;s profile, select &#x201C;mute/report,&#x201D; and then select from the available categories. Verbal harassment sits at the top. If Psyonix takes action against a player, they&#x2019;re notified later in the main menu. Overwatch <strong>How does Blizzard police harassment?</strong> Blizzard is one of <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-scott-mercer-says-addressing-toxic-players-is-an-issue-across-blizzard/\"> the most outspoken studios </a> on <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzards-failure-to-curb-toxicity-undermines-overwatchs-inclusive-message/\"> toxicity </a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1Md792fF8\"> related issues </a>. However, that outspokenness more often translates to support tools for well-behaved players than any sort of explanation for how bad players are punished. Blizzard used to punish repeatedly abusive chat users in Overwatch by simply muting them, but still allowing them to play. That&#x2019;s now changed, with those players receiving lengthier and lengthier bans for each successive offense. Blizzard is unclear on the rubric it uses, and unclear on how that&#x2019;s balanced between automated systems and real humans banging the gavel, but it does say that a player with enough reports and punishments on their record will receive a permanent ban. Negative players are given warnings prior to an actual punishment, something director Jeff Kaplan has said has helped stop players from causing further trouble. <strong>How do well-behaved players fight back?</strong> Since launch, Blizzard has allowed PC players to report individual players via the report function, and added the function to consoles in mid-2017. Besides picking a category of bad behavior, players also have the ability to include a brief description of their experience with each individual report. Blizzard has also stated that it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1Md792fF8\"> searches out recordings </a> of toxic behavior on YouTube, Twitch, or other sites to find negative players and address them. After/during each match, Overwatch players can also select up to two players to block with the &#x201C;avoid as teammate&#x201D; option. Players can deselect or replace one person with another, but Blizzard has stated that that number may rise if the program doesn&#x2019;t cause any issues. There&#x2019;s also the new &#x201C;find team&#x201D; function that lets players avoid the pitfalls of solo queuing into a match with nothing but Hanzo mains. PC Gamer reached out to Blizzard to clarify how these punishments are determined, but has yet to receive a response. ",

Its year-long grip on the top spot was beginning to waver in recent weeks, increasingly finding itself at #2 in the face of a big new release. Now its weakening dominance has seen it slip another spot down.

Steam trading and Steam Market functionality, which were <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-and-dota-2-trading-disabled-in-the-netherlands-after-loot-box-crackdown/\">disabled last month</a>, have been re-enabled, but players in the country, as well as Belgium, are no longer able to open containers&#x2014;which is to say, loot boxes.&#xA0; Market and item trading were switched off after the Netherlands Gaming Authority ruled that some videogame loot boxes&#x2014;it didn&apos;t reveal which&#x2014;were in <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/netherlands-gaming-authority-cracks-down-on-loot-boxes-in-some-games/\">violation of the country&apos;s gambling laws</a> and therefore had to be changed, with a deadline set for June 20. Valve said at the time that it didn&apos;t &quot;understand or agree with&quot; the ruling, and had contacted the Gambling Authority for clarification; in the meantime, &quot;our only practical alternative is to disable trading and Steam,&quot; it explained. Belgium <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/belgiums-gambling-commission-rules-against-loot-boxes-in-overwatch-fifa-18-and-csgo/\">issued a similar ruling</a> on loot boxes shortly after the Netherlands and specifically named CS:GO, along with Overwatch and FIFA 18, as being in contravention of the law, but did not set a deadline for compliance.&#xA0; Re-enabling the CS:GO market, but disabling cases, means that players in the Netherlands will be able to buy and sell items directly, but not partake in the randomized luck-of-the-draw of lootboxes. That probably won&apos;t make CS:GO fans who like to play the ponies very happy, but it&apos;s presumably enough to keep Valve out of legal trouble, and it&apos;s better than the across-the-board shutdown that Valve went with originally.&#xA0; The latest CS:GO patch notes are available in full at <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-07-12-cs-go-update-blocks-players-in-netherlands-and-belgium-from-opening-loot-boxes\">counter-strike.net</a>.

        "contents": "After teasing us for months about CS:GO eventually getting updated to use the &#x201C;Panorama&#x201D; interface that Dota 2 has been using since its Reborn update in June 2015, Valve has finally <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/csgos-new-panorama-ui-is-now-live/\"> released a public beta </a> of CS:GO with the new UI up and running. This was one of our <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/what-we-want-from-valve-in-2018/\"> big wishlist items </a> for CS:GO in 2018, and I&#x2019;m happy to report that it&apos;s pretty darn good. Admittedly, the bar has been set pretty low for Panorama, as the existing CS:GO interface is nothing to write home about. It&#x2019;s looked more or less the same since the game&#x2019;s release in 2012; a ton of game features and their respective menu options have been added since then, but the overall look and feel of the UI has remained pretty static. Big structural issues, like the fact that you can&#x2019;t navigate any of the inventory or loadout options while you&#x2019;re in a lobby with your friends, have been left unaddressed for years, and aesthetically it&#x2019;s about what you&#x2019;d expect from a game released in 2012. There are also a couple stylistic choices that seem a bit questionable, and not being bugs, they seem unlikely to be changed. Fortunately, those days appear to be behind us, as the Panorama update is a complete overhaul that replaces virtually every UI asset. Going through the menus in the public beta, it&#x2019;s hard to spot much of anything that hasn&#x2019;t gotten the Panorama treatment, which is a good thing, since the end result is a much more modern-feeling game. The visual facelift isn&#x2019;t the only thing Panorama has to offer either. It also introduces some clever new features, like a landing page that shows you recent news posts (a common and useful element in most recent multiplayer games), some new explanatory tooltips, and a handy table that shows you what your teammates have equipped themselves with when you&#x2019;re in the buy menu. You can now navigate the various pre-match menus while sitting in a lobby with your party. It&#x2019;s worth reiterating that this is just a beta, and as such, not all the kinks have been ironed out yet. A bunch of the console commands don&#x2019;t work properly, there are a couple actions that will get you stuck on an inescapable menu screen, and there&#x2019;s something a bit weird going on with the way your crosshair is rendered. There&#x2019;s a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/8sc1cq/panorama_ui_beta_feedbackbugs_megathread/\"> big thread full of bug reports </a> on the CS:GO subreddit, so it may be a little while yet before Panorama is ready for primetime. Valve has already released its first patch for the beta version, however, and seem keen to get it ready for final release in short order. What&apos;s not to like There are also a couple stylistic choices that seem a bit questionable, and not being bugs, they seem unlikely to be changed before the update goes live unless the community gets extremely up in arms about them. Foremost among these annoyances is the background treatment for the new scoreboard; in the old UI, the scoreboard simply darkened the area of the screen it occupied enough for you to see the white scoreboard text, allowing you to see through it fairly easily. The Panorama version applies a blur effect instead, making it largely impossible to see your crosshair or any environmental details in the middle of your screen. For players who tend to compulsively check the scoreboard during the round, this is a big downgrade, and looks an awful lot like Valve trying to fix something that wasn&#x2019;t broken. Another head-scratcher is the inclusion on the main landing page of a big, animated player model right in the middle.This format has become pretty ubiquitous of late, perhaps due to its appearance in DayZ and PUBG, but it makes little sense in a game with, at the moment, virtually no cosmetic character customization to speak of. Surely there are more fruitful bits of information this screen real estate could be used for in CS:GO. Minor quibbles aside, Panorama has survived the migration from Dota 2 to CS:GO remarkably intact. Given how enormous of an upgrade it is over the dated UI we&#x2019;ve been using until now, one gets the impression of playing a whole new game upon first sight of the new main menu. It&#x2019;s a breath of fresh air to see Valve taking big steps like this to modernize CS:GO. One of the longtime complaints of the Counter-Strike community has been that despite boasting similar player numbers to Dota 2, it never feels like CS:GO gets nearly the same amount of love from its developers, and I suspect an update like this will help assuage that bitterness in the hearts of Counter-Strike&#x2019;s crustiest detractors. Here&#x2019;s to hoping Valve can continue shipping substantive, high-quality updates like this going forward, and we can all stop reading snide HLTV comments about how Counter-Strike is a dying game.

The Kansspelautoriteit accusation is different from how other countries think about loot boxes, so we hired Dutch legal counsel, looked at the recent Study into Loot Boxes published by the Kansspelautoriteit, and learned more about Dutch law. We still don&#x2019;t understand or agree with the Kansspelautoriteit&#x2019;s legal conclusion, and we&#x2019;ve responded to explain more about CS:GO and Dota 2.</em> <em>In the meantime, we have a threat from the Kansspelautoriteit to prosecute Valve if we don&#x2019;t implement a remedy by June 20. The letters don&#x2019;t tell us how to do that, but the Study into Loot Boxes does contain one rather simplistic statement:</em> <em>&quot;Loot boxes contravene the law if the in-game goods from the loot boxes are transferable. Loot boxes do not contravene the law if the in-game goods from the loot boxes are not transferable.&quot;</em> <em>So for now our only practical alternative is to disable trading and Steam Marketplace transfers for CS:GO and Dota 2 items for Dutch customers. We apologize to you for this inconvenience. We hope that, after more engagement with the Kansspelautoriteit, they may refine their legal demands and we can find a solution that is less inconvenient.</em> This move follows Belgium&apos;s loot box injunctions, whose Gambling Commission also <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/belgiums-gambling-commission-rules-against-loot-boxes-in-overwatch-fifa-18-and-csgo/\" target=\"_blank\">ruled against loot boxes in Overwatch, FIFA 18, and CS:GO</a> in April.

Players of CS:GO and Dota 2 in the Netherlands were today greeted with a message from Valve saying the company had pulled item trading and Steam Marketplace transfers for both games. Valve said the move was in response to the Dutch threat to prosecute video game companies who failed to alter their game's design by 20th June after it found some loot boxes were gambling. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-20-dutch-loot-box-threat-forces-valve-to-pull-cs-go-and-dota-2-item-trading-in-the-netherlands\">Read more&hellip;</a> ",

        "contents": "The long story of Counter-Strike is a series of minor but meaningful changes. Track the last few years of patches, and between hundreds of weapon skins, you see subtle but serious modifications to map layouts, recoil behavior, and anti-cheat. If you time-traveled a CS player from 1999 two decades into the future to play CS:GO today, they&apos;d find it familiar enough: the AK-47 is still the workhorse of the T-side arsenal, the Nordic countries are still better at the game than everyone else, and de_nuke is still in the active map pool.&#xA0; If things continue along their current trajectory, however, that last staple of Counter-Strike&#x2019;s identity may be the next casualty of its ongoing evolution. Of the seven maps in the current &#x201C;active duty&#x201D; map pool&#x2014;that is, the maps available for players to choose from at big tournaments&#x2014;Nuke is by far the least popular. So far in 2018, 214 matches of CS:GO have been played at high-level tournaments, and of all those matches, only <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/stats?startDate=2018-01-01&amp;endDate=2018-03-27&amp;matchType=BigEvents\"> nine </a> have been played on Nuke. The next-least-played map sees over double the usage, with 20 appearances in high-level games over the same time period. These numbers didn&#x2019;t used to be quite so grim. The map saw more play back in 2014, when <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/stats?startDate=2014-01-01&amp;endDate=2014-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents\"> 15 of the 111 games played at major tournaments were played on Nuke </a>, placing it firmly in the middle of the pack compared to the other active duty maps. Since then, its popularity has waned sharply, despite a <a href=\"http://www.counter-strike.net/reintroducing_nuke\"> graphical overhaul and substantial redesign </a> in early 2016. What happened to Nuke? Radioactive When I pose that question some of the game&#x2019;s top-tier professionals, I learn that there&#x2019;s not much of a consensus on why the map has fallen out of favour. Opinions range from believing that it&#x2019;s a great map and that people just aren&#x2019;t bothering to learn the unique tactics required to be successful on it, to believing it&#x2019;s a fundamentally flawed map that can&#x2019;t be fixed without completely reinventing it. French pro Nathan &quot;NBK-&quot; Schmitt, currently of G2 Esports, finds himself close to the first position. &#x201C;In general I think Nuke is a very underrated map,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a very interesting map its layout, and that it&apos;s very different and unique compared to other maps.&#x201D; Questioned further, NBK- offered a hypothesis. &#x201C;The main thing, I think, is that teams are either very good at it, or average-to-bad on it,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;So those teams that are average or bad on it are going to be 70-80% of the teams &#x2026; and the teams that can play very well on it will get the map banned because it&#x2019;s gonna be a 100% win against teams that are a bit lower.&#x201D; There are serious issues besetting Nuke from all sides. In other words, it boils down to how large the skill disparity is between the teams that actively practice Nuke, and those that don&#x2019;t bother to focus on the map because it doesn&#x2019;t see much play at major tournaments. The nature of the CS:GO tournament format is that each team gets to ban at least one map from being played during any given match, so for the teams that don&#x2019;t practice Nuke, it&#x2019;s a no-brainer to ban it when playing against a team that&#x2019;s known for their Nuke play. Nuke&apos;s uniqueness exacerbates this problem, too. The more ways in which the map differs from the rest of the active pool, the more bespoke strategies and map-specific knowledge are required to do well on it, and the more time a team would need to dedicate to practicing it if they wanted to catch up to the teams who already know what they&#x2019;re doing on it. Nuke, with it&#x2019;s unconventional bombsite placement and total lack of a traditional mid configuration, finds itself on the extreme end of the spectrum as far as divergence from the status quo. The end result is that no one ever gets to play it except in the event that two of the few teams who do bother to practice Nuke happen to run into each other in a tournament bracket. Of course, this means that the map is stuck in a bit of a negative feedback loop. Because no one plays it, teams aren&#x2019;t incentivized to practice on it, and because no one practices on it, no one wants to play on it when it comes time to pick maps during major tournament matches. Vent There are also criticisms to be made about the design of the map itself, from those with a less enthusiastic view than that of NBK-. Jimmy &quot;Jumpy&quot; Berndtsson, the current coach of Fnatic, finds himself in this camp. &#x201C;When they made a change, when they added the outer catwalk and everything,&#x201D; Jumpy says in reference to the changes made in the early 2016 update, &#x201C;I felt it was a bit messy in a way, because as CT you can hide in so many spots, and as T you can in so many spots.&#x201D; This abundance of choices, he says, led to a higher degree of randomness in high-level play, because it became harder for players to know where they should be looking. He&#x2019;s more enthusiastic about the latest version of the map that was released in February, saying &#x201C;With the new changes now, I really like the update &#x2026; I think it&#x2019;s more balanced in a way, you can push yard now and the CT can&#x2019;t hide everywhere, and Ts can&#x2019;t exploit going outer catwalk really fast.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s unclear whether these tweaks will be enough to break the aforementioned feedback loop. There s room for more communication between Valve and the pro scene. Another issue raised&#x2014;one that will be far more difficult to fix with minor balance updates&#x2014;relates to the overall layout of the map. On a normal Counter-Strike map, the two bomb sites that the T side must attempt to reach are generally on opposite sides of the map from each other, with enough distance between them that it will take a player a bit of time to run from one to the other. Nuke, however, is unique in the regard; its bombsites are stacked one on top of each other, occupying more or less the same footprint, but on two different storeys of the same buildings. &#x201C;Because of the levels, you can go down under and you hear them from up top, sometimes you&#x2019;re just really confused, like &#x2018;Am I hearing him down under, or is he above me, or is he to the right or the left?&#x2019; I think that&#x2019;s the most confusing part,&#x201D; says Lukas &quot;gla1ve&quot; Rossander, current captain of Astralis. There are serious issues besetting Nuke from all sides. Some have to do with the nature of the map itself, and some to do with the nature of competitive Counter-Strike and how the map pools and tournament formats work. None seem to have an easy solution. Fission The good news is, in contrast to the widely varying views from the pro scene on what&#x2019;s wrong with Nuke, their answer of what to do about it is surprisingly unified. &#x201C;I guess three or four times a year we should just sit down with Valve and talk about what we could do better at the different maps, and especially Nuke, because there&#x2019;s a lot of people not liking to play that map,&#x201D; says gla1ve. &#x201C;If they&#x2019;re planning on introducing a new map, released it a bit before the major, let people try it out, then just have a meeting with all the final teams at the major and talk about the new map and what their plans for it are,&#x201D; Jumpy echoes. &#x201C;I know they approach some people, but they don&#x2019;t have like a big meeting, just to talk through, to let teams open their opinions. I think they can learn a lot from the players, and I think the players can learn a lot from the developers.&#x201D; Even NBK-, who has few grievances with the current design of Nuke, feels like there&#x2019;s room for more communication between Valve and the pro scene. &#x201C;I think important for the players to talk with Valve and tell them what is not possible on a map,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;For instance if they take something out of a map, or they add something, or they change something, if most of the pro players see it as a problem, I think that should be where Valve decides to change things and listen to the players.&#x201D; The consensus is clear: Valve still needs to do more to gather feedback from the highest-level players of their game, and use that feedback to make improvements that will increase the calibre of play at the top level. Whether that will be enough to save Nuke remains to be seen, but the pro scene believes that it will be a net good for Counter-Strike in general, and has at least some chance of being able to revitalize one of the game&#x2019;s most iconic locales.

It was billed as a &quot;vigilante in-game hit squad&quot; made up of elite women gamers who would &quot;beat bullies at their own game.&quot; Basically, players encountering abuse in CS:GO were encouraged to contact the Bully Hunters, who would then send one of their players to &quot;infiltrate&quot; the game and deliver righteous justice through a righteous ass-kicking. &#xA0;&#xA0; Noble goal, dubious process, and unsurprisingly it all went about as wrong as it possibly could have. Following allegations of toxic behavior by Bully Hunters members themselves and the resurfacing of tweets by representative streamer Natalie &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheZombiUnicorn\" target=\"_blank\">ZombiUnicorn</a>&quot; Casanova containing homophobic and abusive language, sponsors and supporters quickly pulled out, the Bully Hunters <a href=\"https://bullyhunters.org/\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BULLYHUNT3RS/\">social media</a> pages went dark, and today the company behind it pulled the plug on the whole thing.&#xA0; &quot;BullyHunters pitched us with a simple idea - let&#x2019;s work together to fight online harassment.

She has previously used what could charitably be called &quot;combative&quot; language in tweets, and a clip of her using a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeWuzMetokur/status/984583188952616960\" target=\"_blank\">homophobic slur</a> during a livestream was also shared to Twitter. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &quot;Various tweets show wrongdoing by host, Zombi Unicorn, which are actions that Diverse Gaming Coalition does not condone, although she was not solely to blame for the Bully Hunters initiative as a whole,&quot; The Diverse Gaming Coalition wrote. And while it was under the impression that the Bully Hunters would continue, it &quot;does not align with our mission and vision statement as a non-profit. Because of this, we are deciding as of now, we are dropping as a partner from the Bully Hunters initiative.&quot;&#xA0; Casanova addressed her use of toxic language in a statement in which she said that, &quot;due to the overwhelming amount of harassment, toxicity, hate &amp; threats,&quot; she would be stepping away from the project. &#xA0;&#xA0; She also suggested that she too was misled by the campaign, specifically with regard to the statistics about abuse that it quoted. &quot;Projections based on market size estimate of 32.7 million female console gamers in the US by YouGov, and 9.6 percent reported that they quit playing a certain game permanently because of harassment as reported by International Business Times,&quot; she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheZombiUnicorn/status/985306010490253312\">wrote</a>. &quot;Those statistics were extrapolated by Bully Hunters to express a point that sexual harassment has negatively effected more women this way. I used those stats from their posts and was told the sources would be listed on the site. I also didn&apos;t feel qualified enough to discuss them in depth, so I noted to watch the event to hear the licensed psychologist and guests discuss it better.&quot; The cumulative effect of the damage was simply too much to overcome, and marketing agency FCB Chicago, which launched the program, told <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/16/17238262/bully-hunters-steelseries-zombiunicorn-csgo\">Polygon</a> that it is over.&#xA0; &quot;As this effort did not live up to our high standards, we decided to end this program, but hope the conversation it has raised around ending harassment in gaming continues,&quot; global chief communications officer Brandon Cooke said. He added that other involved organizations provided no financial support or sponsorship. &quot;In most cases they were just supporting the cause. SteelSeries helped connect us with a few gamers and provided some headsets for the live event. That&#x2019;s all,&quot; he said. &quot;One , but the other was not.&quot; Despite the outcome and the deluge of personal harassment she&apos;s experienced as a result, Casanova defended the goals of the project, if not the way it went about achieving them. &quot;Love it or hate it, it did its job,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x2019;s brought a lot of attention to this. It&#x2019;s opened up the discussion to more people. Yeah, it&#x2019;s brought a lot of trolls, but it&#x2019;s opened the discussion.&quot; ",

        "contents": "The Time&apos;s Up movement that caught fire in the wake of #MeToo and allegations of sexual misconduct against notorious Hollywood scumbag Harvey Weinstein has now made its way to videogames, in a distinctly gamer-esque fashion. Beginning on April 12, a self-styled A-Team of &quot;elite female gamers&quot; calling themselves the <a href=\"https://bullyhunters.org/\">Bully Hunters</a> will offer their services to victims of harassment and bullying in CS:GO by infiltrating games and beating down offenders &quot;through the sheer force of their unmatched skill.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;The time for harassment in CS:GO is finally up,&quot; the group said in an announcement. &quot;A collective of gamers, brands and organizations have teamed up to create a first-of-its-kind global tool that connects victims of in-game harassment with gamers who want to help, called the Bully Hunters. The Bully Hunters are a vigilante hit squad of elite female gamers who have banded together to end sexual harassment and abuse in the popular game CS:GO.&quot; The campaign is backed by some high-profile supporters, including Twitch streamer <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/zombiunicorn\">ZombiUnicorn</a>, a spokesperson for the campaign, as well as SteelSeries, Vertagear, CyberPowerPC, the <a href=\"https://www.diversegaming.co/\">Diverse Gaming Coalition</a>, and the <a href=\"https://now.org/\">National Organization for Women</a>. The members themselves have chosen to remain anonymous, however, in order to avoid the ironic but entirely-too-predictable likelihood of harassment and abuse, although a rep said&#x2014;optimistically, I think&#x2014;that team members will do their best to keep the heat on the field.&#xA0; &quot;The Bully Hunters are prepared for the possibility of retaliation and are putting measures in place to combat that. They will not purposely incite or encourage additional harassment or abuse, and will only engage with harassers through gameplay, eliminating them from the game using their skills and talent,&quot; a rep explained. &quot;Additionally, there will be a ratings system within the global tool which will allow both hunters and victims to rate their experiences, therefore reducing the chances of trolls infiltrating the system.&quot;&#xA0; Dunking on online jerks is great, but the real point of the exercise is drawing attention to the problem of sexism and abuse online. The Bully Hunters claim that more than <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BULLYHUNT3RS/\">21 million</a> female gamers have reported in-game sexual harassment, &quot;including extreme threats of sexual violence and death,&quot; and while that number is an estimate, the prevalence of abuse obviously is not. Yet all too often it&apos;s brushed off as mere trash-talk: Inevitable, but harmless. &#xA0;&#xA0; &quot; hope that through more conversation, fewer online gamers will tolerate this behavior and work to put an end to it. They are also calling on software companies to take action to no longer tolerate sexual harassment and discrimination in their games,&quot; the rep said.&#xA0; The Bully Hunters is meant to be a &quot;long-term initiative,&quot; and they&apos;re looking to expand their presence beyond CS:GO, although which games they may move into next is still being decided. Naturally, they&apos;re also looking to grow their numbers. Signups will be taken at the Bully Hunters website, but they were clear that they won&apos;t take just anyone.&#xA0; &quot;To become a Bully Hunter, a gamer&#x2019;s statistics will be evaluated to ensure they can compete at a high level to eliminate harassers,&quot; the rep said, without delving into exactly what &quot;statistics&quot; will be examined, or how. &quot;Additionally, their history of play will be reviewed to ensure they haven&#x2019;t been reported for any type of in-game harassment with other players.&quot;&#xA0; The goal of the campaign is laudable, but since abusive behavior is Bully Hunters&apos; Bat-signal, you can see the group itself being a magnet for abusers&#x2014;especially since at least some of the action will be livestreamed to the world <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/events/VrLu-FqsS8uTF7HAUxztrw\">on Twitch</a>. But maybe that&apos;s part of the point&#x2014;to draw negative attention away from average gamers and let them know they&apos;re supported. ",

        "contents": "All popular multiplayer games fight never-ending battles against cheaters. But as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive rose in 2014 to become the most-played FPS in the world, a few things made it particularly susceptible to hacking.&#xA0; As the 10th game released on Source (and the third mainline CS), there were already piles of knowledge on how to tamper with Valve&apos;s engine. Hacks built for ancient stuff like Half-Life 2: Deathmatch could, with a few minutes&apos; tweaking, perhaps function in CS:GO (although Valve says they&apos;d be trivial to detect). Design-wise, the traits that make CS:GO a skillful game of angles and accuracy also make cheats more effective. Weapons are highly lethal, so putting those guns in the hands of aimbots makes them even more devastating. And CS:GO&apos;s focus on information and stealth means that knowing the location of your opponent is invaluable&#x2014;fertile ground for wallhacks. CS:GO&apos;s fight against hackers is &quot;important, valuable work&quot; according to Valve, but if you&apos;ve played the FPS, you may have noticed a couple years ago that things were beginning to get dramatically better. Not only did Reddit complaints and frustrated replay clips of cheaters seem to circulate less frequently, but the perception of cheating&#x2014;as hazardous as anything to a competitive game&apos;s health&#x2014;seemed to dissipate. We published stories of high-profile bans, along with news of <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/more-than-11000-csgo-cheaters-ate-the-banhammer-today/\"> thousands of cheaters </a> getting banned in single waves. How was Valve purging most of these jerks? \"Cheaters didn't get the memo we were doing it, and players were super happy and we were just busting cheaters left and right. It felt so good.\" John McDonald, Valve In one of the only in-depth moments of transparency on this topic, Valve programmer John McDonald spoke at the Game Developers Conference last week in San Francisco about how he and Valve used deep learning techniques to address CS:GO&apos;s cheating problem. This approach has been so effective that Valve is now using deep learning on &quot;a bunch of problems,&quot; from anti-fraud to aspects of Dota 2, and Valve is actively looking for other studios to work with on implementing their deep learning anti-cheat solution in other games on Steam. Solving CS:GO&apos;s cheating problem While between projects sometime in 2016, McDonald noticed that &quot;The only thing the community was talking about was cheating,&quot; based on online discussion and a private email address that received mail from CS:GO pros. &quot;It was this, just, deafening conversation,&quot; he says. The uptick in VAC bans around this period, McDonald says, supported what Valve was hearing. To combat the issue, Valve and McDonald looked to deep learning, a solution that had the potential to operate and adapt over time to new cheating techniques&#x2014;attractive traits to Valve, which has historically elected to automate aspects of Steam rather than hire hundreds of new employees to tackle issues like curation. What Valve created is known as VACnet, a project that represents about a year of work.&#xA0; VACnet works alongside <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/\"> Overwatch </a>, CS:GO&apos;s player-operated replay tool for evaluating players who have been reported for bad behavior. VACnet isn&apos;t a new form of VAC, the client and server-side tech that Valve&apos;s used for years to identify, say, when someone&apos;s running a malicious program alongside a game. VACnet is a new, <em>additional</em> system that uses deep learning to analyze players&apos; in-game behavior, learn what cheats look like, and then spot and ban hackers based on a dynamic criteria. \"Our customers are seeing fewer cheaters today than they have been, and the conversation around cheating has died down tremendously.\" John McDonald, Valve McDonald says that &quot;subtle&quot; cheats remain difficult to solve, but in building VACnet, Valve decided to target aimbots first because they present themselves at specific, easily-definable points during rounds of CS:GO: when you&apos;re shooting. This allowed Valve to build a system that captured the changes in pitch (Y-axis) and yaw (X-axis)&#x2014;degree measurements in a player&apos;s perspective&#x2014;a half a second before a shot, and a quarter second after. This data, along with other pieces of information like what weapon the player is using, their distance, the result of the shot (hit, miss, headshot?) are the individual &apos;data particles&apos; that together form what Valve calls &quot;atoms,&quot; essentially a data package that describes each shot.&#xA0; VACnet can&apos;t necessarily spot a cheater based on one atom, though. &quot;We need a sequence of them, what we actually want is 140 of them, or at least that&apos;s what the model uses right now &#x2026; We just take the 140 out of an eight round window and we stuff those into the model, and we&apos;re like, &apos;Hey, if you were to present this sequence of 140 shots to a juror, what is the likelihood you would get a conviction?&apos;&quot; Pretty good, as it turns out. Both players and VACnet report players for judgment in Overwatch. But when VACnet reports a suspected cheater, they&apos;re almost always a cheater. &quot;When a human submits a case to Overwatch, the likelihood that they get a conviction is only 15-30 percent, and that varies on a bunch of factors, like the time of the year, is the game on sale, is it spring break. There&apos;s a bunch of things but the point is human convictions are very low,&quot; says McDonald. &quot;VACnet convictions are very high, when VACnet submits a case it convicts 80 to 95 percent of the time.&quot;&#xA0; A slide from McDonald's talk: a model of the relationship between Overwatch and VACnet. That doesn&apos;t mean Valve plans to phase out its cheater theater, Overwatch. Both systems work together: VACnet learns detection techniques from Overwatch, McDonald says. &quot;Because we&apos;re using Overwatch and we didn&apos;t actually replace all player reports, we just supplemented them, that means that the learner is getting the opportunity to evolve along with human jurors. So as human jurors identify new cheating behaviour, the learner has the opportunity to do the same thing.&quot; McDonald adds that when VACnet has been recently retrained with player data to spot a new cheat, the conviction rate might be nearly 100 percent for a short period before cheaters adapt to it. When Valve quietly rolled out VACnet to CS:GO&apos;s 2v2 competitive mode earlier this month, McDonald says &quot;the conviction rate for that mode was 99 percent for a while, it was great. Cheaters didn&apos;t get the memo we were doing it, and players were super happy and we were just busting cheaters left and right. It felt <em>so good</em>.&quot; Large Hacker Collider To bring VACnet to life, a server farm had to be built that could handle CS:GO&apos;s millions of players, loads of data, and grow as CS:GO grew. Right now there are about 600,000 5v5 CS:GO matches per day, and to evaluate all players in those matches Valve needed about four minutes of computation, amounting to 2.4 million minutes of CPU effort per day. You need about 1,700 CPUs to do that daily work. So Valve bought 1,700 CPUs. And 1,700 more, &quot;so we&apos;ll have room to expand,&quot; McDonald says, hinting at Valve&apos;s intention to bring VACnet to other games. Conservatively, Valve had to have spent at least a few million dollars on that hardware: 64 server blades with 54 CPU cores each and 128GB of RAM per blade. That&apos;s a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-top-100-games-on-steam-made-50-of-the-total-money-in-2017-according-to-steamspy/\"> $120M </a> CS:GO brought in off of game copy sales alone in 2017, but it probably represents one of the beefiest anti-cheating farms built for a single game.&#xA0; The work continues, but from McDonald&apos;s perspective, VACnet is kicking ass, and has potential application not only in non-Valve games, but in other stuff on Steam. &quot;Deep learning is this sea-change technology for evolutionary behaviour,&quot; says McDonald. &quot;We think that it is really helping us get developers off of the treadmill without impacting our customers in any way. Our customers are seeing fewer cheaters today than they have been, and the conversation around cheating has died down tremendously compared to where it was before we started this work.&quot; Early December 2017 brought a new milestone for the system: VACnet started producing more convictions than non-convictions in Overwatch. &quot;The system works great,&quot; says McDonald.

        "contents": "Gabe Newell gives a presentation at Valve about upcoming card game Artifact. At a presentation for upcoming Dota 2-themed card game Artifact at Valve&apos;s offices in Bellevue, Washington today, Gabe Newell reiterated that Valve is getting back into developing new games beyond its current roster of multiplayer titles. After talking about Valve&apos;s focus on Steam and hardware during the past several years, which he described as &quot;an investment in the future&quot;, Newell said &quot;Artifact is the first of several games that are going to be coming from us. So that&apos;s sort of good news. Hooray! Valve&apos;s going to start shipping games again.&quot; That&apos;s game<em>s</em>, plural: Artifact isn&apos;t the only game Valve is working on. In a January 2017 <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gabe-newell-valve-is-using-source-2-for-unannounced-products/\"> Reddit AMA </a>, Newell did confirm that Valve was working on at least one fully-fledged singleplayer game. And the following month, in roundtable interviews with PC Gamer, Newell said that Valve was working on &quot;<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-is-working-on-3-full-blown-vr-games-says-the-vr-market-has-exceeded-its-expectations/\"> three big VR games </a>.&quot; Today&apos;s statement doesn&apos;t make it 100 percent clear whether Valve has projects in development <em>beyond</em> these previously mentioned games, but it is a possibility. &quot;We aren&apos;t going to be talking about it today,&quot; Newell said, &quot;but sort of the big thing, the new arrow we have in our quiver, really, is our ability to develop hardware and software simultaneously.&quot; Newell gave some background on Valve&apos;s projects from the last few years, like SteamVR and the Vive headset, explaining that the company was worried about the PC heading in the direction of an iPhone-esque closed ecosystem. &quot;You can see that Microsoft was like, wow, how can we make Windows more like that? Or Zuckerberg is saying, &apos;well I tried to compete in the phones, I got my ass kicked, so I&apos;m going to create this new thing, VR, which will allow me to recreate the kind of closed, high margin ecosystem that Apple&apos;s done.&apos; And that really started to worry us, because we thought that the strength of the PC is about its openness &#x2026; So we started to make some investments to offset that.&quot; \"We've always been a little bit jealous of companies like Nintendo.\" Gabe Newell Those investments, Newell said, meant they hadn&apos;t released a new game since Dota 2&#x2014;but that work wasn&apos;t wasted time. &quot;The positive thing about the Vive is, in addition to making sure that nobody created an iOS closed platform for it, was also that it gave us the opportunity to develop our in-house expertise in hardware design. Five years ago, we didn&apos;t have electrical engineers and people who know how to do robots. Now there&apos;s pretty much no project in the hardware space that we wouldn&apos;t be comfortable taking on. We can design chips if we need to, we can do industrial design, and so on. So that added to that.&quot; With Valve&apos;s new hardware chops, it seems like we can expect more than new games from the company. &quot;We&apos;ve always been a little bit jealous of companies like Nintendo,&quot; Newell said. &quot;When Miyamoto is sitting down and thinking about the next version of Zelda or Mario, he&apos;s thinking what is the controller going to look like, what sort of graphics and other capabilities. He can introduce new capabilities like motion input because he controls both of those things. And he can make the hardware look as good as possible because he&apos;s designing the software at the same time that&apos;s really going to take advantage of it. So that is something we&apos;ve been jealous of, and that&apos;s something that you&apos;ll see us taking advantage of subsequently.&quot; ",

Furthermore, the allegations that led to the suspension arose from &quot;unsubstantiated, false accusations leveled at Varga by a third party, whose accusations were the culmination of an effort to publicly disparage Varga and take advantage of his popularity.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;It is clear from Twitch&apos;s conduct that the stated bases for suspension and termination were an effort to deflect negative press and scapegoat Varga, allowing Twitch to publicly decry alleged gambling conduct and divert attention from the fact that Twitch continued to knowingly allow such conduct to continue on other Twitch channels,&quot; the suit states.&#xA0; Varga alleges that he wasn&apos;t given a reason for the suspension until January 2017, nearly five months after it happened, when a Twitch rep told him that his channel had fraudulent subscribers. At some point after that, however, he was told that the real problem was the amount of non-gaming content he streamed, including CSGO skin gambling, which violated content guidelines.&#xA0; But Varga claims that he was told multiple times by Twitch employees that he could stream such content for up to 30 consecutive minutes at a time, and that Twitch &quot;was aware that the representation was false.&quot;&#xA0; The suit says Varga suffered significant financial and reputational harm as a result of the suspension, which occurred despite him fully satisfying all the conditions of his contract. He&apos;s seeking general, special, and exemplary damages, interest, legal fees (including &quot;expert witness fees&quot;), and whatever else the court deems appropriate. &#xA0;&#xA0; Varga, as far as I can tell, has not returned to Twitch since his initial suspension, but he&apos;s been streaming on YouTube since last year. A Twitch rep said the company does not comment on pending litigation.&#xA0; ",

First, it&apos;s a <a href=\"http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Souvenir\">souvenir skin</a>, which are available exclusively from souvenir packages that only drop during Valve-sponsored CS:GO tournaments. Dragon Lore is actually the rarest skin in the <a href=\"https://csgostash.com/collection/The+Cobblestone+Collection\">Cobblestone Packages</a>, which currently sell for a little north of $30 each on the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Boston%202018%20Cobblestone%20Souvenir%20Package\">Steam Marketplace</a>. &#xA0;&#xA0; This particular skin is also &quot;factory new,&quot; and its stickers are all &quot;unscratched,&quot; each of which compounds its rarity even further. And the timely <em>pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance </em>is that it bears the autograph of Tyler &#x201C;Skadoodle&#x201D; Latham, the MVP of the ELEAGUE Boston Major 2018 where Cloud9 made its mark. &#xA0;&#xA0; The skin was originally purchased for $35,000 by a collector named Drone, who told <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/30/16952248/counter-strike-global-offensive-dragon-lore-skadoodle-skin-sale-opskins\">Polygon</a> that the selling price, despite being so much higher than what he paid (which seems absolutely nuts to begin with), was as low as he was willing to go. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t originally get into this game solely for profit,&quot; he said. &quot;I just got very lucky a couple of times, and money is more valuable to different people. I&#x2019;m very lucky in my financial state to where I can afford to buy these skins and it does not affect me.&quot; &#xA0;&#xA0; ",

Image courtesy HLTV, click for source. </a> It&#x2019;s been a long wait for North American fans, but after five years of waiting, they finally have their home-continent heroes. The all-American squad of Cloud9 fought their way through a murderer&#x2019;s row of the best CS:GO teams in the world&#x2014;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/american-team-makes-it-to-the-final-of-a-csgo-major-for-the-first-time-ever/\"> including the #1 ranked SK Gaming </a>&#x2014;to make it into the finals of ELEAGUE Boston Major 2018, then emerged victorious from a grueling, three map, double overtime match against the European superteam of FaZe Clan. On paper, this looked like one of the most lopsided grand finals in CS:GO Major history. FaZe Clan is notorious for being &#x201C;the most expensive team in Counter-Strike history&#x201D;, having bought out the contracts of the best players from several of the best teams in the world. One of their players has won two Majors in the past, and the rest of them have made it deep into the elimination brackets at previous Majors. With SK Gaming, the only higher-ranked team in existence, suffering from the loss of one of their core players, the consensus was that this was FaZe&#x2019;s tournament to win. Cloud9&#x2019;s current lineup, on the other hand, is composed entirely of younger players with fairly modest winnings to their names. As a team, they&#x2019;ve never even made it into the top eight of a Major, and most of the individual players have never made it anywhere near this far in this caliber of tournament. Few people were predicting this outcome. Not only did the American underdogs come out on top, they did so in a manner that made for one of the most spectacular grand finals in Counter-Strike history. They started things off inauspiciously, losing their own map pick in a 16-14 nail-biter; this set them up to have to face FaZe on Overpass, a map that Cloud9 has lost four times in a row to FaZe in previous tournaments. Despite that history hanging over their heads, the young team put on a clinic in the early rounds, pulling out a variety of aggressive, exciting plays to drive the score up to an imposing 15 rounds to 4. FaZe showed signs of rallying after half-time, as H&#xE5;vard &quot;rain&quot; Nygaard found his groove and started posting some big frag numbers, but the comeback was eventually shut down by Cloud9 for a final map score of 16-10. This set the stage for a final showdown on the final map of the tournament, Inferno, where both teams had demonstrated strong tactics in previous matches. Cloud9 got off to a strong start on the CT side, eventually settling for a respectable first-half score of 7-8 in FaZe&#x2019;s favour. Things began to look grim for the Americans during the second-half, however, as FaZe strung enough rounds together to cripple Cloud9&#x2019;s economy, driving them to the brink of death with a 15-11 scoreline. Then, to the visible frustration of a FaZe Clan who felt that this tournament was theirs for the taking, and with the hometeam crowd threatening to bring down the arena roof, Cloud9 posted four consecutive rounds to bring the score to 15-15 and force overtime. It took them two overtime sets, and a few scarily messy-looking rounds, but Cloud9 finally got the job done. Final score: 22-19. For the young players of Cloud9, this marks a new high point in their Counter-Strike careers, and for fans of Cloud9 and North American Counter-Strike in general, it marks the end of a drought that had stretched on so long that it began to feel like an unliftable curse. Tyler &quot;Skadoodle&quot; Latham, the quiet Cloud9 player who was awarded the tournament MVP trophy, was asked in the post-match interview what was ahead for Cloud9. His answer was simply, &#x201C;a lot of tournaments.&#x201D; We can only hope those future tournaments are half as electrifying to watch as this weekend&#x2019;s has been. ",

Since the advent of the Valve-supported Major tournaments in 2013, no North American team has ever won one; today, at the penultimate day of ELEAGUE Boston Major 2018, the Americans of Cloud9 have brought themselves tantalizingly close to ending that drought. After a rocky start in the group stages, Cloud9 fought their way back into contention with a convincing 2-0 win over the French squad of G2 Esports. The vagaries of the tournament bracket meant that this victory set them on a collision course with CS:GO&#x2019;s current team to beat, the top-ranked Brazilians of SK Gaming. Riding a wave of momentum, and with the hometown crowd cheering their countrymen on, Cloud9 nonetheless entered their semi-final match as the heavy underdog. As soon as the first map got underway, it was clear that it was time to throw rational predictions out the window. A series of incredibly well-executed rounds and some huge individual plays led Cloud9 to a crushing 16-3 victory to start things off, shocking the analyst desk and driving the crown into a frenzy. Despite the second map not going quite as well, resulting in a 16-8 victory for SK Gaming, Cloud9&#x2019;s momentum appeared unbreakable, and they rallied to win 16-9 on the third map to clinch their berth in the tournament&#x2019;s grand finals. This outcome marks only the second time a North American team has managed to make it into the finals of a Major, after Team Liquid reached (and subsequently lost) the finals of ESL One Cologne back in 2016. If they pull off a win tomorrow against the formidable opposition of FaZe Clan, they will make CS:GO history, and perhaps begin to turn the reputation of American Counter-Strike around. They&#x2019;ll also have faced one of the toughest roads to victory of any Major-winning team in recent memory, due to their lacklustre performance in the group stages putting them in a very tough bracket position. Making their way through G2 Esports, SK Gaming and FaZe Clan, <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/2018/january/23\"> the fourth, first, and second best </a> CS:GO teams in the world respectively, is a feat that will finally put to bed any question about Cloud9&#x2019;s legitimacy as a top-tier team on the world stage. You can catch the grand finals at 11:00am PST on Sunday morning on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/eleaguetv\"> ELEAGUE&#x2019;s Twitch channel </a>. ",

        "contents": "Battle.net may have Destiny 2, but Steam has millions of simultaneous PUBG players. GOG may have the best collection of DRM-free games, but Valve has, well, PUBG again. And Dota 2, and CS:GO. Competition has increased a lot in the past 10 years, but despite the growth of GOG, itch.io, Origin, Battle.net, the Microsoft Store, and others, Steam is still <em>the</em> gaming store on PC, and Valve runs two of the biggest esports in existence. Its influence on PC gaming can&apos;t be understated, so it naturally receives heaps of criticism and suggestions from players <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/if-valve-wants-to-make-steam-the-best-it-can-be-these-issues-are-a-good-place-to-start/\">and developers</a> alike. That&apos;s how it goes when you&apos;re on top. Ruling out obvious fantasy, like a DRM-free release of Half-Life 3, here&apos;s what we hope PC gaming&apos;s de facto leader does in 2018. Is a new Steam interface on the way? A Steam interface overhaul A big update to Steam&apos;s interface <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/heres-the-full-valve-presentation-on-steams-forthcoming-ui-update/\">was teased last year</a>, and it&apos;s about time. While Steam has changed a lot since 2003&#x2014;mostly as new features were tacked on&#x2014;it still leaves much to be desired. Better automated sorting of our libraries would be a start. If you have tags, why not let us use them? The controller settings are weird, opening in a Big Picture Mode-style window and changing my Steam overlay to the same as if there&apos;s no way someone would use a controller at their desk. The music section of my library is a mess, with repeat entries that don&apos;t play. In other words, the tacked-on features feel tacked on. Without entirely throwing out the interface we&apos;re used to, an extensive UI and feature refresh would be welcome. (GOG Galaxy&apos;s version rollback feature would be welcome, too.) &#x2014;<em>Tyler Wilde</em> CS:GO on Source 2 The biggest thing on the wishlist for CS:GO players heading into the new year is the long-awaited move to the Source 2 engine. Rumors have been circulating about when this change-over will finally happen for at least two years now, since shortly after Dota 2 was moved to the new engine in the fall of 2015. Valve <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-next-operation-source-2-ai-cheat-detection\">confirmed back in April</a> that they&#x2019;re working on giving CS:GO the same treatment, but so far this update has yet to materialize. In addition to the presumed graphical optimizations of moving to the new engine, the content creation tools for new maps, new skins, etc. are allegedly a vast improvement over the original Source tools. Hopefully, this means we&#x2019;ll see a glut of new user-created content when the update drops, thanks to the modernized and more user-friendly creation tools. Similarly, the other big item on the wishlist is the promised upgrade to the new &#x201C;Panorama UI&#x201D;, a complete overhaul of all of CS:GO&#x2019;s menus and interfaces using the panel-based UI that Dota 2 has already adopted. Just like the Source 2 update, this change has been in the works for quite some time now; Valve confirmed they were &#x201C;preparing&#x201D; for the UI switch at least as far back as the <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2016/07/15283/\">summer of 2016</a>, but as with everything else Valve does, they&#x2019;ve been rather tight-lipped about any sort of timeline for the Panorama implementation. Below these big-ticket items on our 2018 wishlist, there are a litany of smaller changes we&#x2019;d like to see happen: * Classic maps like Mirage and Dust would benefit from the same sort of overhaul Inferno, Nuke, and Dust 2 have received over the last couple of years.&#xA0;; * The map pool could use some fresh entries (or some revivals of classic entries) to keep the competitive meta interesting.&#xA0;; * An unranked version of CS:GO&#x2019;s core 5-vs.-5 competitive format has been a popular community ask for years now. * Valve&#x2019;s anti-cheat technology is lagging behind third-party services like ESEA, and could use a serious upgrade. The astute observer will notice that almost everything mentioned herein could&#x2019;ve just as easily appeared on a similar list at the end of last year. It often feels like CS:GO is a lower priority for Valve than its other esports juggernaut, Dota 2, so while there are plenty of updates we&#x2019;d like to see in 2018, it seems unwise to get our hopes up that many of them will happen particularly soon. Nonetheless, we&#x2019;ll keep our fingers crossed. &#x2014;<em>Mitch Bowman</em> A little warning before Dota 2 changes The TI7 contestants were announced abruptly. The Pro Circuit system was announced abruptly. The games contest was announced, and soon extended, abruptly. Gameplay mini-patches were released abruptly, at one point abruptly breaking custom games.&#xA0; A surprise is nice sometimes, but when it comes to Dota 2, one of the biggest games in the world, not everything should come as such. At least a million players likely clock in every day, and a significant chunk of that population&#x2014;plus some non-players&#x2014;follow the competitive scene that&#x2019;s grown from it. Basically, there are a lot of players trying to just play the game and keep up on a fundamental level.&#xA0; So, for many out there already irrevocably attached to the experience, frequently needing to stay up-to-date and ready-to-go is exhausting. Maybe it&#x2019;s just become part of the Dota life: you wake up, see if Valve has done something, and then continue with life. But why does it have to be like that? Dota 2 players could use a little communication. Just a bit. You can put something off for six hours to get us ready, and you don&#x2019;t have to give a Riot-length explanation, nor a Developer Diary. It can be a six-hour heads-up on a patch, an announcement of an announcement, or a new way to share what teams are heading to TI. Have someone sit at a computer and press the buttons so people don&#x2019;t guess teams from the source code. Or all of the above. Valve, you&#x2019;re allowed to steal these ideas. In fact, please do.&#xA0; Of course, we&#x2019;re also talking about Valve here, and that&#x2019;s just part of how they do things. I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re aware, but the reason why they haven&#x2019;t changed anything is beyond me and anyone else in the scene who isn&#x2019;t actually a Valve employee. But it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to ask. &#x2014;<em>Victoria Rose</em> Improved moderation and curating Steam Direct is great for new developers who don&apos;t have publishers, but the consequence is an influx of ripoffs and shovelware. In theory, Steam&apos;s algorithmic discovery tools and Curators should surface only the best games, and truthfully, my store page is looking pretty nice during the Winter Sale&#x2014;a healthy mix of good deals and games I might be interested in. But that&apos;s not quite the case in the Popular New Releases section, which is consistently full of free or free-to-play games. Free games aren&apos;t necessarily <em>bad</em>, but the &apos;popularity&apos; metric means free clickers and gags naturally get promoted over anything with even a small price tag, potentially burying great games that dare to cost five bucks.&#xA0; 2018 should see an even bigger influx of new games&#x2014;thousands upon thousands&#x2014;and I&apos;m skeptical that these automated and community-driven tools will be able to keep up. At the minimum, I hope Valve more aggressively cuts asset flips&#x2014;which it <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/173-probable-trading-card-farming-games-have-been-removed-from-steam/\" target=\"_blank\">did a bit of in 2017</a>&#x2014;and outright insulting games, and sets a clearer policy on nudity and sex. It&apos;s been <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/steams-rules-about-adult-content-continue-to-baffle/\" target=\"_blank\">totally inconsistent</a> in that latter regard, even <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-anime-porn-is-giving-some-games-a-second-shot-at-success/\" target=\"_blank\">receiving criticism</a> from a porn game distributor. An increase in moderation is doubly needed in the Steam community. It took me five seconds to find a group advertised with a lynching icon and a swastika. Delete. &#x2014;<em>Tyler Wilde</em> As always, a game Valve says <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/gabe-newell-valve-is-using-source-2-for-unannounced-products/\"> it&apos;s working on a few </a>, but we aren&apos;t holding our breath. And no, nice as it was, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/bridge-constructor-portal-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Bridge Constructor Portal</a> doesn&apos;t count. &#x2014;<em>Tyler Wilde</em> ",

        "contents": "Valve News Network reported a couple of weeks ago that the venerable online shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive might be <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-might-be-getting-a-pubg-style-battle-royale-mode/\">getting a battle royale mode</a> at some point in the future. But modder Kinsi wasn&apos;t willing to wait for it to happen, so they went ahead and created one of their own.&#xA0; Called <a href=\"https://go4thekill.net/\">Go 4 The Kill</a>&#x2014;or Go4TK, to save time and space&#x2014;the mod features a map more than four times the size of <a href=\"http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Overpass\">Overpass</a>, and three to four times larger than the Source engine normally allows. As <a href=\"https://steamed.kotaku.com/modder-creates-pubg-style-mode-in-counter-strike-1821607713\">Kotaku</a> explains, it accomplishes this feat by breaking its map into sections separated by mountain ranges: Crossing the mountains places you into what is effectively another map, but everything is connected so you can move back and forth seamlessly. Despite the size of the playing field, performance should be roughly equivalent to conventional CS:GO maps because there&apos;s very little &quot;&apos;unnecessary&apos; detail,&quot; aside from what&apos;s required to provide cover for players. While PUBG is commonly cited as the battle royale standard-bearer, Kinsi said the inspiration for Go4TK came from a different game. &quot;With Go4TK my aim was to combine two games that I like: <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/king-of-the-kill-devs-talk-about-pubg-we-just-sort-of-try-to-ignore-any-comparison/\">King of the Kill</a> and CS:GO,&quot; they wrote. &quot;It was mainly meant to be a challenge for myself to push the boundaries of whats possible with server-side only CS:GO modding. From the ground up I&apos;ve carefully handcrafted everything, be it the map in itself or the plugin allowing for the actual gameplay to ensure the best possible integration.&quot;&#xA0; There are some <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Go4TK/wiki/index/csgo_differences\">significant gameplay differences</a> between Go4TK and CS:GO. Bullet drop and travel time are modeled, running will not reduce firing accuracy, weapons have randomized inaccuracy but no recoil patterns, ADS (aim down sight) is very important if you want to hit what you&apos;re shooting at, and if you get shot yourself, you&apos;ll bleed&#x2014;and if you don&apos;t do something about it, you&apos;ll keep on bleeding until you die. It is also, despite being much larger than conventional CS:GO experiences, a smaller-scale experience than PUBG: Kotaku says the maximum player count is 20, while the Go4TK site says players per game is &quot;targeted at 49.&quot; Go 4 the Kill was actually released back <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/6uk7j6/battleroyale_in_csgo_after_8_months_of_work_i/\">in August</a>, and work has continued since. There have been setbacks as well, most notably the shutdown of North American servers in November due to lack of interest. Kinsi said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Go4TK_CSGO/status/945744399337697281\">on Twitter</a> that they might be brought back online soon, &quot;thanks to a generous Redditor,&quot; although how long they&apos;ll be kept around will depend on how much use they see.

        "contents": "For the first time ever, the UK Gambling Committee&apos;s year-end report on <a href=\"http://live-gamblecom.cloud.contensis.com/PDF/survey-data/Young-People-and-Gambling-2017-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Young People and Gambling</a> has looked into &quot;awareness and participation rates&quot; of skin gambling (if you&apos;re not sure what that is, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\" target=\"_blank\">here&apos;s a primer</a>). The report states that, &quot;based on the description provided within the questionnaire,&quot; 45 percent of children aged 11-16 knew about skin gambling, and 11 percent said they had placed bets with in-game items at some point in the past.&#xA0; &quot;&apos;Skins&apos; are in-game items, used within some of the most popular video game titles. They provide cosmetic alterations to a player&#x2019;s weapons, avatar or equipment used in the game,&quot; the report states. &quot;Skins betting sites allow videogamers to wager cosmetic items rewarded in-game or purchased for real money on a digital marketplace, accessible from the UK for several years.&quot;&#xA0; A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42311533\">BBC report</a> on the Gambling Commission paper leads with the statistics on skin gambling and then says that roughly 370,000 11-16 year olds in England, Scotland, and Wales reported spending their own money on gambling at least once in the prior week. But the context is misleading: The number is accurate, at least within the survey&apos;s margin of error, but it includes all forms of gambling, including slot machines, scratch cards, and wagers with friends (&quot;five bucks says you can&apos;t make that jump&quot;). Furthermore, the figure &quot;represents a continuation of the longer-term decline seen since 2011,&quot; when 23 percent of 11-15 year-olds reported taking part in some form of gambling during the preceding week.&#xA0; Prevalence of gambling with in-game items increases with age, from three percent of 11 year-olds to 14 percent of 14-16 year-olds, and was higher among children who had spent money on other forms of gambling over the past week, or who had played &quot;online gambling-style games,&quot; like casino games, slot machines, or poker. In fact, the rate of playing those games matches the incidence rate of skin gambling, at 11 percent. It&apos;s the ability to convert in-game items into cash that denotes the activity as gambling for the purposes of the report, rather than the actual conversion itself&#x2014;the fact that the skins <em>could </em>be converted into cash, not whether they actually were. That&apos;s also how the concept was introduced to survey respondents: &quot;When playing computer games/app it is sometimes possible to collect in-game items (eg. weapons, power-ups and tokens). For some games, it is possible to bet these in-game items for the chance to win more of them.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;The Gambling Commission takes the view that the ability to convert in-game items to cash, or to trade them (for other items of value) means they attain a real-world value and become articles of money or money&#x2019;s worth. Where gambling facilities are offered to British consumers, including with the use of in-game items that can be converted into cash or traded (for items of value), a gambling license is required,&quot; the report says. &quot;Tackling operators making gambling facilities available to children is one of the Gambling Commission&#x2019;s priorities.&quot;&#xA0; In other words, it&apos;s the people running unlicensed gambling sites who are liable to be targeted by the Gambling Commission, and not the games themselves, or the companies who make them. In fact, earlier this year the commission <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/youtuber-avoids-prison-after-pleading-guilty-to-fifa-gambling-offences/\">successfully prosecuted</a> YouTuber Craig &quot;Nepenthez&quot; Douglas and his business partner Dylan Rigby, who ran the FUT Galaxy website that enabled gambling on real-world soccer matches using FIFA 17 virtual currency. But that currency could also be exchanged for real money, which fell afoul of the UK&apos;s Gambling Act and cost the duo &#xA3;255,000 ($340,00) in fines. &#xA0;&#xA0; &quot;Because of these unlicensed skin betting sites, the safeguards that exist are not being applied and we&apos;re seeing examples of really young people, 11 and 12-year-olds, who are getting involved in skin betting, not realizing that it&apos;s gambling,&quot; Gambling Commission chief executive Sarah Harrison told the BBC. &quot;At one level they are running up bills perhaps on their parents&apos; Paypal account or credit card, but the wider effect is the introduction and normalization of this kind of gambling among children and young people.&quot;&#xA0; ",

(CSGO Lotto)</a>.&quot; The initial settlement, reached <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-controversy-results-in-requirement-for-disclosure/\">in September</a>, set new standards of disclosure on the two and the site, forbidding them &quot;from misrepresenting that any endorser is an independent user or ordinary consumer of a product or service.&quot;&#xA0; Per the settlement, Martin and Cassell are forbidden from misrepresenting endorsers as independent consumers, must &quot;clearly and conspicuously&quot; disclose their endorsements and connections with other endorsers, submit a compliance report to the FTC in one year, and maintain a variety of records relating to their accounting, consumer complaints, marketing material, and personnel for the next 10 years. No actual penalties were imposed, however, which didn&apos;t sit well with a few members of the public who took advantage of the commission&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/2017/09/initiative-715\">invitation to submit comments</a> on the decision. &quot;I am appalled and disgusted with this ruling. These two deserve a hefty fine, if not jail time, for knowingly misleading their largely adolescent fanbase into using a gambling website that they owned,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/2017/09/08/comment-00002\">Jack Thorpe</a> wrote. &quot;The items that were being traded on CSGO Lotto had real money value, and these two were pocketing millions from rigging a system that they owned.&quot;&#xA0; Another, using the name <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/2017/10/08/comment-00004\">Maloney</a>, noted that Martin and Cassell had &quot;purposelessly deceived their audiences by pretending to have found CSGO Lotto and recommend to use it when in fact they owned it from the beginning.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;I believe this deliberate action deserves a larger punishment than just warnings to not do it again,&quot; they wrote. &quot;A precedent needs to be set in order to stop these malicious acts from further occurring.&quot;&#xA0; A third respondent, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/2017/09/11/comment-00003\">Christopher Jahn</a>, acknowledged that the CSGO Lotto site had a clause in its TOS stating that users must be at least 18 years old, but then moved on to the obvious: &quot;Let&apos;s be honest here, what teenager is actually going to abide by that, let alone even read it? Can you imagine a modern day teenager saying, &apos;Well, I&apos;m not quite 18 yet, guess I&apos;ll be a law abiding citizen and go do something else&apos;? No teenager is going to do that.&quot;&#xA0; These were the only three to comment, and their words were not enough to have an impact on the ruling.&#xA0; The full text of the FTC&apos;s CSGO Lotto settlement is available <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1623184_csgolotto_agreement_and_decision_and_order.pdf\">here</a>, and you can get a closer look at what caused all the trouble in the first place in our explanation of <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\">CSGO skin gambling</a>.

        "contents": "CS:GO skins and all other Steam Market items are subject to a $400 maximum listing price. Items are often sold for greater sums through key trades, a sub-currency of the CS:GO economy. A single CS:GO key costs $2.50 USD and can be sold on the Steam Marketplace. To break through the $400 ceiling, you convert your listing price to a key value. If you want to sell an item for $500, divide your listing price by the key value, 500 by 2.5: 200 keys. Most people use third-party trading websites to list CS:GO&#x2019;s rarest wares, but once a trade is made, those keys can be sold back into the Steam Marketplace. There are some skins in our list that definitely break that cap, but due to both the extraordinary rarity of these items and their inconsistent prices in the key market, we&#x2019;ve pulled our best estimates from varying trading sites. These are subject to change on a whim, but remain impressive no matter how transitory. <em></em> Guns <strong>Souvenir AWP: Dragon Lore, ~ $4200 (10,000 keys) </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=260056264\"> Dragon Lore, Field Tested </a> The Cobblestone Collection The original Dragon Lore skin originally fetched a hefty $10,000, but this commemorative skin still commands a quaint $4,200, almost as if to say &#x201C;Why have my scope flash off the morning sun when I can just use these totally rad gold stickers?&#x201D; This particular Dragon Lore commemorates the Grand Final match of the 2015 DreamHack Cluj-Napoca CS:GO Championship between Natus Vincere and Team EnVyUs, and is autographed by MVP Denis Koslin. <strong>AK-47: Fire Serpent, $3200 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=278269155\"> Fire Serpent, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Bravo Collection I&#x2019;m no economist, but does it say something that this skin is basically three times as expensive as a real-world AK-47? This holiday, please think of the less fortunate arms dealers, and buy this commemorative memento from the Operation Bravo: Ruins map. Let&#x2019;s see a Precious Things statue spit fire like this. <strong>M4A4: Howl, ~ $3700 (1500 keys) </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=274355973\"> Howl, StatTrak Factory New </a> The Huntsman Collection, May 2014 Turns out crime still pays. OK, technically it&apos;s mundane internet art theft, &#xA0;but this bit of contraband still stands as one of the primo skins for competitive CS:GO enthusiasts, and it&#x2019;s only getting rarer.&#xA0; The Howl&apos;s extraordinary price is due to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-weapon-skin-removed-after-dmca-takedown-notice/\"> the unusual controversy </a> that followed it after release, which included the gun&apos;s removal from distribution&#x2014;but not from owners&apos; inventories. CS:GO stopped dropping new Howls long ago, so the lucky initial owners of this lion-faced piece of copyright infringement own one of the most coveted status symbols in the game.&#xA0; <strong>P90: Emerald Dragon, ~ $550 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=277482039\"> Emerald Dragon, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Bravo Collection Asian artwork is always in good taste. Just ask your local tattoo artist. Hopefully your aim is a little more straightforward than this poor lizard, because he&#x2019;s all over the place on this skin. Remember, kids, always assign a designated dragon. Might as well pick it up now, since it&#x2019;s currently less than half of its original $1,000 price tag. <strong>AWP: Medusa, ~ $1400 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=277153654\"> Medusa, Minimal Wear </a> The Gods and Monsters Collection While this fetching gorgon skin demanded a hefty $400 upon release back in May of 2015, it&#x2019;s only risen in value since, topping out currently at about $1,400. You might say its high value is set in stone&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll show myself out. <strong>AK-47: The Empress, ~ $750 </strong><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20AK-47%20%7C%20The%20Empress%20%28Factory%20New%29\"> Empress, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Spectrum 2 Collection Finally, you too can be the belle of the ball, the becky with the good hair, the yas queen. Look, what do you want from me? It&#x2019;s a pretty lady with blonde locks that would make Reinhardt blush. This skin helped ring in the Chinese release of CS:GO just last September, so if you&#x2019;re looking for some fresh paint, have at it. <strong>AUG: Akihabara Accept, ~$500 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=277739585\"> Akihabara Accept, Factory New </a> The Rising Sun Collection Anime is trash&#x2026; and so am I. The Akihabara Accept still commands a decidedly not-trash price (a remarkably consistent $500 average since release, though some have sold for over $1,000), so I guess we&#x2019;re stuck with visions of pink-haired teens slaughtering us from afar. God bless Japan. <strong>Five-SeveN: Hyper Beast, ~$200 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=279031535\"> Hyper Beast, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Operation Hydra Collection Doom&#x2019;s floating sphere of teeth, the Cacodemon, has got nothing on this sinister-looking Swedish meatball. If you pull the trigger, it&#x2019;s like wiggling its tongue. If you want a little extra spice with your meatball, the Hyper Beast skin can also be purchased at considerably lower rates for the AWP, Nova, and M4A1-S. &#xA0;<strong>MP9: Bulldozer, ~$250 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=225308119\"> Bulldozer, Factory New </a> The Assault Collection You&#x2019;ll be a bulldozer in the eyes of your enemies with this skin: Loud, yellow, prone to making odd noises when you back up. The Assault Collection skin pack hasn&#x2019;t been part of the regular loot drop in CS for a few years, so it&#x2019;s gone from selling like dirt to plowing cash. <strong>AWP: Boom ~$400 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=277242463\"> Boom, StatTrak </a> The eSports 2013 Collection With a classic comic book framing, this skin shows off its entrepreneurial spirit. No need for boisterous cries of &#x201C;Boom! Headshot!&#x201D; when you can just cut out the middleman. I look forward to the eventual Disney-owned shared universe. <strong>Souvenir USP-S Road Rash, ~$400 </strong><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Souvenir%20USP-S%20%7C%20Road%20Rash%20(Factory%20New)\"> Road Rash, Factory New </a> The Overpass Collection Remember when mom would take you to the mall for new clothes, but your enlightened 13-year-old self just had to have those pre-torn jeans? This is like the gun equivalent of that. Why didn&#x2019;t you stop us, mom? This skin dropped during the ELEAGUE Atlanta 2017 CS:GO Championship Grand Final Match, and is autographed by MVP Peter Rasmussen AKA &#x201C;dupreeh&#x201D; of team Astralis. <strong>M4A1-S: Master Piece, ~$2900 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=263187245\"> Master Piece, Souvenir, Factory New </a> The Overpass Collection If you look closely enough, you can see a faint homage to the Mona Lisa smile between the first squiggly line and the fifth, just behind the lettering that reminds you of a passing train car. This skin was dropped during the ESL Cologne 2015 CS:GO Championship&#x2019;s Quarter Finals match, and is signed by MVP H&#xE5;vard &#x201C;rain&#x201D; Nygaard, then of Team SoloMid. <strong>AK-47: Red Laminate, ~$450 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=249384758\"> Red Laminate, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The eSports 2013 Collection They took an AK-47, dashed it with some nice red paint, and poured laminate all over it. It&#x2019;s the Flamin&#x2019; Hot Cheeto of guns. Get this one while it&#x2019;s hot, because it&#x2019;s been rising from a modest $300 to a $450 average since October 2016. <strong>AK-47: Fuel Injector, &#xA0;~$320 (156 keys) </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=276959103\"> Fuel Injector, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Wildfire Collection Yellow. The color of sunshine, bees, and the light you try to ignore while driving. Throw caution to the wind with this simple skin (sold at a remarkably consistent $400 average) that will leave your victims wondering how that oversized banana got the drop on them. <strong>AK-47: Wasteland Rebel, &#xA0;$425 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=271047984\"> Wasteland Rebel, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Vanguard Collection As far as war chants go, &#x201C;MAKE THEM CRY!&#x201D; ain&#x2019;t too bad. It certainly rests alongside other such classics as &#x201C;YOU DON&#x2019;T EVEN GO HERE!&#x201D; and &#x201C;HEY, WANNA FIGHT?&#x201D; For you Counter-Strike lore hounds, the Wasteland Rebel&#x2019;s flavor text indicates it&#x2019;s a favorite of Naomi, a bodyguard to Operation Bloodhound Terrorist leader <a href=\"http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Valeria_Jenner\"> Valeria Jenner </a>.&#xA0; <strong>AWP: Oni Taiji, ~ $145 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_search&amp;app=730_2&amp;ref=csgoanalyst&amp;aid=44&amp;search_item=%22StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20AWP%20%7C%20Oni%20Taiji%20(Factory%20New)%22&amp;StatTrak=1&amp;vanilla=0&amp;sort=lh\"> Oni Taiji, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Operation Hydra Collection &#x201C;Taiji,&#x201D; more commonly referred to in the West as &#x201C;Tai Chi,&#x201D; is the ancient Chinese philosophy of supreme ultimate state of undifferentiated absolute, infinite potential, and the oneness before duality. You know, yen and yang. Pretty heady stuff for a gun with a demon on the butt. While it&#x2019;s currently on a downswing price-wise, it might not be a bad idea to pick up one ASAP considering Operation Hydra recently ended. <strong>AWP: Pink DDPAT, ~ $130 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=272843095\"> Pink DDPAT, Souvenir, Minimal Wear </a> The Overpass Collection At some point, Counter-Strike scientists asked &#x201C;if Barbie had an AWP, what would it look like?&#x201D; The Pink DDPAT pairs well with any seasonal outfit, be it for a jaunt at the mall, or in the official Barbie DreamCamper. Sleep well, Ken. If you&#x2019;re worried about getting dropped by cross-map headshots, maybe take a chance on the DDPAT at the lowest price it&apos;s seen since release three years ago. This souvenir skin commemorates the 2017 PGL Krakow CS:GO Championships, was dropped during the Group Stage match between SK Gaming and Immortals, and is autographed by MVP Fernando Alvarenga. <strong>M4A4: Royal Paladin, ~$320 </strong><a href=\"https://csgo.steamanalyst.com/id/158579777/StatTrak%E2%84%A2-M4A4-Royal-Paladin-Battle-Scarred-Factory-New\"> Royal Paladin, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Revolver Case Collection The Royal Paladin is a proper statesman&#x2019;s rifle. An elegant leaf engraving, fine ivory, and enough gold to fix at least a few mouthfuls of teeth. Though it&#x2019;s had some significant dips, the Royal Paladin has maintained an impressive $350 average price over two years. That&#x2019;s monarchy for you. <strong>AK-47 Neon Revolution, ~$155 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=277750980\"> Neon Revolution, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Gamma 2 Collection Pink as a clown&#x2019;s bum, with &#x201C;ANARCHY&#x201D; emblazoned in spray paint on the side. It&#x2019;s a rifle with all the quiet modesty of a Jared Leto acting role. Wait, when did this skin come out? Summer of 2016? Oh, no. *Checks flavor text.* Well, at least something is producing a better return-on-investment than that trainwreck. <strong>USP-S: Neo Noir, ~$120 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=279917811\"> Neo Noir, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Spectrum Collection I&#x2019;ve seen things you people wouldn&#x2019;t believe. Counter-Terrorists on fire off the shoulder of bomb site A. I watched grenades glitter off the skybox into our spawn from across the map. All those moments will be lost in time, like lag in the rain. The USP-S is one of the few guns on this list with roots as a fan favorite from Counter Strike: Source, so maybe a few of those epic moments can live on with you in the end. Knives <strong>Karambit: Lore, ~ $1400 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=272149001\"> Lore, StatTrak, Factory New </a> It&#x2019;s a knife called &#x201C;Lore,&#x201D; but I&#x2019;m not exactly seeing any further exploration of the Counter Strike world beyond a rad visual design. Still a better love story than Destiny. Ha, commentary. Comes with a custom knotwork paint job, and it shows. The skin originally sold for $400, a mere penance compared to the $1,200 minimum you&#x2019;ll likely find these days. <strong>M9 Bayonet: Night ~$620 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=261049946\"> Night, Factory New </a> Sleek, yet simple. Dark, yet pointy. Seems like as good an excuse as any to yell out &#x201C;I AM THE NIGHT!&#x201D; over and over again. If, like its flavor text describes, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;the bite at your neck,&#x201D; this skin might just bleed your wallet dry. <strong>M9 Bayonet: Crimson Web ~$950 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=273275944\"> Crimson Web, Factory New </a> Some knives are silver, some are black, some are even the color of the rainbow. This little buddy does you the solid of getting all red and nasty before you even start to work. Thanks, champ. Also spreads jam really well. Gloves &amp; Stickers <strong>Moto Gloves: Spearmint, ~ $700 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_search&amp;app=730_2&amp;ref=csgoanalyst&amp;aid=44&amp;search_item=%22%E2%98%85%20Moto%20Gloves%20%7C%20Spearmint%20(Minimal%20Wear)%22&amp;StatTrak=0&amp;vanilla=0&amp;sort=lh\"> Spearmint, Minimal Wear </a> Wash the taste of a bad match out with these minty mittens, at least until all your friends are asking for a piece. Warning: Do not ingest gloves, especially ones that taste like pine trees. Hey, at least after spending upwards of $700 (up from $400 a year ago) on gloves, you have all the right in the world to growl &#x201C;and I&#x2019;m all out of bubblegum.&#x201D; <strong>IBuyPower (Holo) ~$4500 </strong><a href=\"https://opskins.com/index.php?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=191570559\"> Marketplace Link </a> You thought the IBuyPower sticker was something else back when it debuted at $400 in 2014, huh? Well, Mr. Moneybags, hope you&apos;re ready for a second mortgage, because this increasingly rare sticker now tops a majority of all CS:GO skins for a lordly $4,500 average. Although the &#x201C;Contraband&#x201D; <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Sticker%20%7C%20Howling%20Dawn\"> Howling Dawn </a> sticker goes for about $200, the first-edition esports stickers are by far the priciest. Among them, Team iBUYPOWER&#x2019;s holographic sticker reaches a whole other level, due to the fact that the team was banned by Valve and dissolved after the discovery that they <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\"> fixed matches for their own benefit </a>.&#xA0; ",

        "contents": "Loot boxes, which burst open to reveal randomized rewards in games, don&apos;t exist because they&apos;re good for game design. They exist because the industry wondered: how do we charge each player the maximum amount they&apos;re willing to spend for as long as we can keep them spending? The answer already existed in a model proven successful decades ago by baseball and Magic: The Gathering cards. In his 2013 book, <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/uncertainty-games\" target=\"_blank\">Uncertainty in Games</a>, Greg Costikyan describes the success of Magic&apos;s card packs: &quot;...When you purchase and open a booster pack, you are always uncertain what you will obtain&#x2014;and may experience delight at finding a new card that works well with others you have, or disappointment at receiving cards that duplicate ones you already have, or worse, quintuplicate them&#x2014;meaning you already have the maximum of this card you can use in a single deck. This is, of course, one reason Magic&apos;s business model is so effective: there&apos;s always a temptation to buy more cards, and players can be induced, in essence, to spend the maximum amount they are comfortable spending on their game, whether that be a few dollars or a few thousand.&quot; Like Magic packs, loot boxes turn the <em>experience of getting stuff</em>, rather than the stuff itself, into what&apos;s for sale, and encourage us to keep chasing the delight of getting what we want. They &apos;work&apos; because they offer an uncertain outcome, and uncertainty is a component of good games, whether it results in a botched saving throw in D&amp;D or a lucky bounce in Rocket League. A box which may or may not contain something rare is not sinful on its own&#x2014;it&apos;s fun. It&apos;s adding money to the mix that&apos;s the problem. I appreciate that Rocket League, CS:GO, Rainbow Six Siege, Overwatch, and other games only offer cosmetic items in loot boxes, and Overwatch in particular is fairly inoffensive as you can work toward skins without purchasing anything but the game. The way Star Wars Battlefront 2 implemented loot boxes, however, shows that the biggest companies are testing the waters: how much can we put in these things? An entire multiplayer shooter&apos;s library of upgrades? They tried.&#xA0; When a progression system is wrapped up in loot boxes which can be purchased with real money, it isn&apos;t a fun progression system, practically by definition. If you&apos;ve made something players can pay to skip, then you&apos;ve made something <em>worth paying to skip</em>. With Battlefront 2&apos;s premium currency temporarily removed, this is hilariously obvious. There is currently no reason for Credits, the non-purchasable currency, to exist, as their only purpose is to abstract achievement so that it can be spent like the premium money, turning &apos;achievement&apos; into &apos;grind,&apos; a paycheck rather than a trophy. Not fun. Loot boxes are surely also why generic upgrades can&apos;t be applied to multiple classes, and why there&apos;s an overcomplicated crafting system&#x2014;there had to be something to buy even after 20 hours of play. Also not fun.&#xA0; Bad game design which transparently exists to encourage spending is frustrating, especially in a game that already costs $60. What may be worse, though, is that by pairing cash and games of chance, EA and other big publishers are endangering every developer by inviting the scrutiny of politicians. Are loot boxes gambling? Buying loot boxes, like gambling in a casino, can potentially be addictive. Buying loot boxes, like gambling in a casino, can potentially be addictive. &quot;We know that the dopamine system, which is targeted by drugs of abuse, is also very interested in unpredictable rewards,&quot; said Dr. Luke Clark, director at the Center for Gambling Research at the University of British Columbia, in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/behind-the-addictive-psychology-and-seductive-art-of-loot-boxes/\"> a recent interview with PC Gamer </a>. &quot;Dopamine cells are most active when there is maximum uncertainty, and the dopamine system responds more to an uncertain reward than the same reward delivered on a predictable basis.&quot; Yet loot boxes are not legally considered gambling in the US and elsewhere, at least according to precedent. A series of 1996 lawsuits brought against baseball card manufacturers under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act claimed that limited-run &quot;chase cards&quot;&#x2014;rare, valuable cards that might appear in a pack&#x2014;constitute an illegal lottery. The suits were not successful.&#xA0;A similar suit against Nintendo in 1999, which claimed that Pokemon cards constituted gambling, was also dismissed. Last year, The Washington State Gambling Commission <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/state-regulator-orders-valve-to-halt-csgo-skin-gambling-through-steam/\"> ordered Valve </a> to &quot;take whatever actions are necessary&quot; to put an end to third-party CS:GO skin gambling sites, where players could <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\" target=\"_blank\">bet valuable gun skins on the outcomes of esports matches</a>, among other things. The Gambling Commission did not, however, take aim at the practice of delivering skins randomly. It is seemingly legal to sell boxes&#x2014;physical or digital&#x2014;with unknown contents, some more valuable to collectors than others. It&apos;s a practice familiar to toy collectors, sometimes <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=blind+box+toys&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=234359717256&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=12181657270579568408&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9007779&amp;hvtargid=kwd-5923379313&amp;ref=pd_sl_6df3zp2dpn_e\"> called &apos;blind boxes.&apos; </a> Above: Hell. It's tempting to read recent anti-loot box statements from politicians as a win, but legislators getting involved in game design is uncomfortable. What&apos;s the legal difference between loot boxes and roulette? Mainly, it&apos;s that in a casino I put down money hoping for it to return to me, whereas when I buy a key for a Rocket League crate I know the money is spent&#x2014;the gamble is whether or not I&apos;ll be satisfied with my purchase. That is an important distinction. However, if the contents of a loot box can be sold for a cash profit, which most can be through sanctioned marketplaces or EULA-defying grey markets, the distinction blurs. Still, unlike gambling, your possible reward is never <em>zero</em>, and the in-game items can&apos;t be turned in to the publisher like gambling chips for cash. Their value entirely depends on the value collectors assign them. So, it&apos;s different, but is it different enough? While the 1996 lawsuits against baseball card manufacturers alleged that it was <em>not</em> different enough and failed, that doesn&apos;t mean legislators will <em>never</em> successfully amend the law. It&apos;s unlikely to change, but it&apos;s still up for debate. <a href=\"https://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-bonus-prize-giveaway-raffle.html\"> Ebay&apos;s policy </a>, for instance, plays it safe by requiring the contents of &apos;grab bags&apos; to be listed in order to avoid sales which might constitute illegal lotteries in some states. In reality, though, I was easily able to find <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_nkw=surprise+box&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_BIN=1\"> multiple listings for &apos;surprise boxes.&apos; </a> Whether they are or aren&apos;t lotteries by law is unclear. Do we want them to be? Whether they are or aren't lotteries by law is unclear. Do we want them to be? It&apos;s tempting to read recent <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/belgium-says-loot-boxes-are-gambling-wants-them-banned-in-europe/\"> anti-loot box statements from politicians </a>as a win&#x2014;we don&apos;t like loot boxes, and they&apos;re saying they&apos;ll get rid of them&#x2014;but legislators getting involved in game design is concerning. A ban on charging for uncertain rewards would end Hearthstone, Magic: The Gathering, and all &apos;blind boxes&apos; and &apos;grab bags&apos; outright&#x2014;you would not be able to buy anything without knowing its exact contents, or perhaps at least their value&#x2014;and lawmakers wouldn&apos;t necessarily stop there. It could be just the in they need to form government-run ratings boards for games, which I oppose completely. It&apos;s not far fetched. In 2005, US Senators Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Tim Johnson, and Evan Bayh sponsored the Family Entertainment Protection Act, which would have put the ESRB under federal observation and fined stores which sold Mature games to kids under 17. In 2012, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20video%20game&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted that videogame violence</a> &quot;must be stopped.&quot; Nothing has come of these intentions to regulate the sale of games, but if certain game systems were deemed gambling, you can be sure that &apos;the danger to our kids&apos; would become a standard talking point again. Meanwhile, mobile games haven&apos;t needed the element of chance to succeed in selling premium currencies. The legality of <a href=\"http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Gems\" target=\"_blank\"> Clash of Clans-like schemes </a> (premium currencies that directly translate to boosts and bonuses and power) isn&apos;t in dispute. So, if loot boxes were declared illegal, we&apos;d get a small victory in pushing game publishers away from design we don&apos;t like, but not necessarily toward design we do, at the expense of increasing government scrutiny which could harm small developers who have no part in this.&#xA0; As much as I want to stick it to corporations, a legal solution is worrisome.&#xA0;And given the precedent, it&apos;s also unlikely to succeed. We&apos;re talking about defining Magic: The Gathering and baseball cards as illegal racketeering, an accusation they&apos;ve weathered successfully for years. Above: Hell. What to do They botched one of their biggest launches of the year, ate a bunch of negative press, and could've avoided it all. The dopamine rush described by Dr. Clark is real, and its easy to see how loot boxes could get children and people who are prone to addiction to overspend. For that and many other reasons, I&apos;d love to get rid of them, if not by forcing indie game developers to submit their games to their state&apos;s gambling control board for inspection. Frustratingly, though, I doubt the catalyst for change will be reduced profits.&#xA0; The truth is that loot boxes <em>are</em> fun to open. I&apos;ve purchased keys for Rocket League crates&#x2014;because I must have the coolest car&#x2014;and spending $10 here and there hasn&apos;t left me with regrets. Many probably feel the same way, so I&apos;m doubtful that &apos;vote with your wallet&apos; is going to force meaningful change. When they&apos;re relatively inoffensive, people are going to keep buying loot boxes, and blaming individual players pointlessly sets us against each other, instead of the people actually responsible: exorbitantly-paid executives and board members.&#xA0; All I can recommend for now is that we keep calling out obnoxious implementations of loot boxes. We may not like what we get when Battlefront 2&apos;s premium currency returns, but that EA removed it the day before launch shows that player criticism had a significant effect. They botched one of their biggest launches of the year, ate a bunch of negative press, and could&apos;ve avoided it all. Whether they end up making money on Battlefront 2 anyway, or losing money, they may think twice about the nature of their in-game purchases next time. Inside the industry, I don&apos;t expect any individual to risk their job by publicly criticizing their bosses&#x2014;we recently <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-case-for-and-against-loot-boxes-according-to-developers/\"> spoke to insiders about loot boxes </a>, and they all asked to remain anonymous&#x2014;though I can&apos;t imagine the average game developer employee loves designing simulated slot machines. On that note, there&apos;s a lot of work to do on the industry that, while seemingly unrelated, would help. Namely, an end to reliance on temporary contractors, crunch, and high turnover, and reasonable profit expectations that don&apos;t require every game to <a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-03-02-eas-ultimate-team-earning-around-usd650-million-a-year\"> pull in half-a-billion dollars per year in microtransactions </a>. Above: What buying currency in Battlefront 2 looked like, before it was removed. I do think it&apos;s understandable that publishers want to earn revenue from existing owners if they&apos;re providing a service. Servers cost money. But it feels pretty obvious that they&apos;ve slowly been working toward something they knew we didn&apos;t want, hoping that if they turned up the heat gradually&#x2014;first pre-order bonuses, then microtransactions, &apos;games as a service,&apos; and finally cribbing the MTG model&#x2014;we wouldn&apos;t notice that the system is designed to encourage overspending on items.&#xA0; Of course we noticed, and so have legislators, reigniting the &apos;gambling for children&apos; collectable card game debates from the &apos;90s. Collectible card games managed to slip away from the controversy, but now that it&apos;s back, the games industry has to reckon with the ethics of how it applies game systems to monetization, as well as the way it produces games and the profits they&apos;re expected to make. If they don&apos;t back off, at least <em>a little</em>&#x2014;say, by only putting cosmetic items in boxes and always providing an alternative way to get them&#x2014;someone else might make a decision for them.

        "contents": "In many ways, last night&#x2019;s CS:GO grand final at IEM Oakland was a battle between two opposing philosophies on how to build a top-tier esports team. On one side of the match you had FaZe Clan, a team created by buying out contracts from other top teams and assembling &#xA0;an all-star roster of talent from across Europe. Playing against them you had Ninjas in Pyjamas, a Swedish team with three veterans of the game who have been playing together for years, and two young up-and-comers who they&#x2019;ve scouted from lower-tier teams and given a shot at competing in the highest level of professional Counter-Strike. On paper, it didn&#x2019;t look like much of a matchup. FaZe Clan&#x2019;s dazzling roster of star talent has been consistently winning big events over the last few months, while the new NiP lineup has struggled throughout the year, culminating last month in a failure to qualify for the next ELEAGUE Major in Boston. Before the match got underway, NiP was being sold by the analyst desk as an underdog with a slim chance at making it through all five maps, and judging by recent performance, this was a fair assessment. There was, however, some early warning signs that this wouldn&#x2019;t be the walk in the park for FaZe that many were predicting. Throughout the group stages it was clear that NiP had found a new chemistry with their recently-acquired young teammates, and any remaining doubt about their competence should have been expelled when they walked through the #1 team in the world <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-pro-turns-the-tide-at-iem-oakland-tournament-with-a-monster-spray/\"> in the semifinals </a>. Through all five maps of the grand final, the old guard of NiP proved why they&#x2019;ve been at the top of the game for so long, landing incredible shots and making smart position plays that kept them winning rounds even when outnumbered or outgunned.&#xA0; Many of the rounds were so closely-contested that huge individual efforts were required from virtually every member of both teams to keep the games close, which resulted in some exciting Counter-Strike to watch, and a handful of stellar highlight-reel plays. After trading map wins back and forth, it all came down to the fifth and final game on Cache, where a close first half lead into a handful of back-and-forth rounds, leaving the score at 10-9 in favour of NiP. Then a gap began to appear. The Swedes began to pull new tactics out of their deep repertoire, like <a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/DeliciousSpeedyAlligatorBudBlast\"> having REZ flank through mid </a> with some excellent timing, and <a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/ArbitraryTrustworthyFriesWoofer\"> sending GeT_RiGhT up into the A site boost spot </a> to wreak unexpected havok. All of a sudden the score was 15-9 courtesy of a string of inventive rounds from NiP. After a brief rally due to <a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/SweetMiniatureBoarKappaWealth\"> a big play from karrigan </a>, FaZe was defeated 16-10. One of the most severe slumps we&#x2019;ve seen a top-tier team go through in modern recollection was at an end, and NiP&#x2019;s new lineup proved themselves to be a potent combination of old-guard experience and tactics, and new-school talent and energy. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the tournament was the performance of 19-year-old REZ, the newest addition to the NiP lineup and a new face in the upper echelons of CS:GO generally. He was consistently a top performer for his team, dropping 24 frags in the first game against FaZe and earning himself <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/news/22073/rez-claims-iem-oakland-mvp-award\"> HLTV&#x2019;s MVP award for the tournament </a>. The Swedish team still won&#x2019;t be attending the Boston Major in January, but they&#x2019;ve shown that they still have the potential to compete at that level with their new roster, and the $129,000 they&#x2019;ve taken home this weekend should be an effective salve for the pain of their weaker performances earlier in 2017.

After losing their first pistol round to SK Gaming&#x2014;the number-one ranked team in the world going into this tournament&#x2014;the Ninjas proceeded to lose four more rounds consecutively due to some aggressive flanking maneuvers from SK&#x2019;s fer. Round six appeared to be heading in a similar direction, with NiP&#x2019;s Xizt left alone at half health to defend the bomb against two opponents. All signs pointed to an unstoppable-looking SK continuing to dominate the match, but Xizt proved why he&#x2019;s been an instrumental part of the NiP lineup for half a decade now with a beautiful AK-47 spray into A bombsite that eliminated both surviving SK players. Despite SK Gaming winning the next two rounds, bringing the score to 7-1 in their favour, the momentum had shifted out from under the Brazilian team. Ninjas in Pyjamas found new strategies to shut down SK&#x2019;s aggression, and won every round for the rest of the half, leaving them at 8-7 going into their CT side. The second half of the map was similarly lopsided, with SK Gaming only winning 2 more rounds before NiP closed out the first game of the best-of-three series 16-9. For a match against ostensibly the best team in the world, on the map that SK had selected to play on, this was an impressive result for a NiP squad that has struggled to produce results at recent LAN events. Compounding the impression that they were finding their formerly world-beating form once again, Ninjas in Pyjamas went on to win the semifinal match 2 maps to 1, losing on Cache courtesy of a massive 32-frag performance from SK&#x2019;s coldzera, then coming back to close the match out on Inferno. NiP&#x2019;s GeT_RiGhT put on a show of his own in the final rounds of the third map, with a flanking maneuver so good that he surprised even the announcers. Ninjas in Pyjamas will now move on to face the winner of the other semifinal match between Cloud9 and FaZe Clan, attempting to add one more championship trophy to their already impressive mantle tomorrow afternoon. If they pull it off, it will be a ringing reminder of their potential to a viewership that had begun counting them out of this tournament before it had even begun.&#xA0; ",

Called Trust, the new system takes a more holistic approach to connecting players than Prime by taking into account a much wider range of factors, including some drawn from outside of CS:GO.&#xA0; Prime Matchmaking requires that players link their accounts to their mobile devices and have a minimum CS:GO rank of 21, to help ensure a reasonably consistent level of skill and commitment between connected players. But that &quot;created a hard boundary in the CS:GO community, and players who might otherwise be perfectly happy playing together were separated,&quot; Valve said in a <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/the-trust-factor/\">blog post</a>.&#xA0; Enter the optimistically-named Trust system. &quot;What if the Prime system was re-imagined using a wider range of factors? We started with that question, and have been experimenting with matching players using observed behaviors and attributes of their Steam account, including the overall amount of time they had spent playing CS:GO, how frequently they were reported for cheating, time spent playing other games on their Steam account, etc,&quot; Valve wrote. &quot;We call this system Trust, and these factors considered together form a player&#x2019;s Trust Factor.&quot;&#xA0; The experiment appears to have worked out. The post says that matches created using Trust have resulted in fewer reports, even among players who don&apos;t have Prime status. As a result, Trust Factor will now be the default CS:GO matchmaking system, although players who prefer Prime can stick with it for now.&#xA0; The blog post includes an FAQ, although some of the most obvious Qs aren&apos;t Ad: Valve isn&apos;t going to provide the full list of variables that determine your Trust Factor, nor is it going to tell you what your Trust Factor is or how you can improve it beyond the general suggestion of not being a dick.&#xA0; &quot;We&#x2019;re still iterating on the Trust Factor model and adjusting the way various factors are combined, but we want to make sure that all you have to do to improve your matchmaking experience is continue to play CS:GO and other Steam games legitimately,&quot; the post says. &quot;The more you play, the more information the system has and the easier it will be for the system to determine who you should be matched with.&quot;&#xA0; Still, if you think your Trust Factor is somehow off the mark because you&apos;re getting low-quality matchups (and you&apos;re reasonably confident that you haven&apos;t been a dick lately), you can drop a &quot;Trust Factor feedback&quot; inquiry email to CSGOTeamFeedback@valvesoftware.com.&#xA0; ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://doctorred2000.deviantart.com/art/SFM-CS-GO-Wallpapers-657157142\" target=\"_blank\"> Image by DoctorRed2000 on DeviantArt </a> For the last few days, Valve has been teasing the release of a revamped version of venerated Counter-Strike map Dust 2, and yesterday <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/feast-your-eyes-on-and-test-out-the-revamped-counter-strike-map-dust2/\"> they spilled the full beans </a> on the new facelift. Valve&apos;s been refreshing old Counter-Strike maps for a while now, in an attempt to keep CS:GO looking as modern as possible, but messing with Dust 2 is a bit more of a risky proposition than modifying less-played maps like Train. The more beloved a map is, the larger the potential backlash will be. Dust 2 has been a staple of competitive play for over 15 years, and was far and away the most played map in the game until its removal from the active map pool back in February.&#xA0; It&apos;s not surprising, then, that Valve&apos;s rework is so conservative. While all the assets have been replaced with higher-res, higher-poly ones, achieving the goal of bringing the map in line with modern graphical expectations, changes to the way the map plays are modest.&#xA0; The biggest change is to the visual clarity, which has been improved across the map. Most of the dark or busy looking areas that allowed players to blend in with their surroundings have been illuminated: the tunnels leading to B are much brighter thanks to a new open ceiling, and a lot of the crates throughout the map have been draped in white cloth to better contrast with player models. Bombsite A benefits from the deletion of the busy-looking doors at the back of A long, and some cleanup of the wall decoration along catwalk. These are bound to be uncontroversial changes, and are in line with what Valve has been doing with the other map facelifts. There&#x2019;s also been some common sense cleanup work that probably should&#x2019;ve happened years ago. Stuff like widening the window from CT spawn into B site, and simplifying the scaffolding near CT-side mid doors, feels like pretty basic quality-of-life improvements that will prevent newer players from getting stuck on weird geometry or having their shots glance off of random pipes. What impact will these changes have? In the coming weeks we&#x2019;ll get a better idea of the full ramifications of this update. A couple things to keep an eye on will be whether the new single car on A long (which replaces a pair of cars that were at odd angles in the map&#x2019;s previous version) will actually be useful as cover now, and whether the increase in room to maneuver behind B site&#x2019;s car will increase its viability as a hold point for CTs. It s a healthy overhaul that makes some modest but interesting changes without reinventing the wheel. There are also some subtle changes that may not even be intentional, and may or may not have a substantial impact on gameplay. Foremost among these is a problem we&#x2019;ve seen already on some of the other modernized maps, but doesn&#x2019;t seem to have caused enough of a ruckus to attract Valve&#x2019;s notice: almost every previously-flat surface is now slightly bumpy (presumably for visual fidelity reasons), which affects the way grenades bounce off of floors and walls. Given how big of a deal smoke and flash placement is in CS, this may prove to be problematic in the long term, as it&#x2019;s going to reduce the accuracy with which banked grenades can be placed. Also on the topic of small, maybe-unintentional changes, the spawn locations have shifted slightly. A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/75lq72/new_dust_2_feedback_and_bugs_megathread_13607rc1/do757d6/\"> helpful redditor </a> has pointed out after exploring the map that counter-terrorists can now get to their side of A long a full two seconds before terrorists can get to theirs, which may impact which corners CT players choose to hold, and which angles T players choose to peek from. Again, these are the kind of changes that will require some time to shake out, and we won&#x2019;t know the full effect of this stuff until the competitive meta has fully adapted, which may take even longer than usual given there&apos;s a decade-plus of habits to unlearn. But Valve seems to have struck a good balance with this update. It&#x2019;s a healthy overhaul that makes some modest but interesting changes without reinventing the wheel. From a purely visual perspective, the new Dust 2 is beautiful, and undeniably an upgrade from the previous iteration. The terrorists have also gotten new higher-fidelity player models as part of the deal, and they&#x2019;re a big improvement over the dated look of the existing models. (Puzzlingly, the CT models have not gotten the same treatment thus far.) There are of course a host of bugs related to the new geometry, allowing for all manner of unintentional boost spots and weird clipping, but this has always been the case with these big map refreshes, and generally they get fixed in a fairly timely manner. Once these issues are addressed, we should expect to see Dust 2 re-added to the Active Duty map pool (possibly at the expense of Cobblestone) and the tournament circuit will quickly demonstrate what effect, if any, the update will have on the way Counter-Strike&#x2019;s most iconic map is played.

Most of the changes are visual&#x2014;Valve has quadrupled the texture resolution and changed the art style, opting for a lighter colour palate and a more obvious North African feel, with signs for a Kasbah (basically a fortress), a bazaar and a hotel. Overall the map manages to feel a lot brighter but more decrepit, with weathered walls and crumbling pillars. I&apos;m a big fan. There&apos;s no major changes to the structure of the map, which I supposed is to be expected, but there are some important tweaks. The most noticeable one is at the B bomb site, where the raised area to the back corner has been lowered so it&apos;s level with the rest of the area, as you can see in the image below (old on the left, new on the right). The slider won&apos;t work here, but you can use it on <a href=\"http://www.counter-strike.net/dust2/\" target=\"_blank\">Valve&apos;s blog post unveiling the changes</a> to compare the two versions. The broken down car on the site has been moved to make it easier to get behind, the famous &apos;window&apos; looking down on the middle of the map has been widened, while the section of tunnels that approaches the bomb site has had parts of the roof smashed away so that more light floods in. Bomb site A has changed less: Valve has removed some of the dark doorways and generally de-cluttered the area so there&apos;s less objects to get stuck on. Take a look: At Mid, Valve has added a new shallow staircase, removed some alcoves and improved the lighting. The last change is to the T-side character models, which Valve hopes make them look like &quot;hardened veterans&quot; of CS.

        "contents": "Don&apos;t look now, but right now might be the best time ever for multiplayer FPSes. I&apos;m old enough to have experienced the &apos;FPSummer of Ninety-Nine&apos; that gave us, egad, Quake III, Unreal Tournament, Team Fortress Classic, and the beginning of Counter-Strike. I think 2017 surpasses that. In terms of depth, frequency of support, and contrasting kinds of multiplayer FPSes I can dig into, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s been a better moment for the PC gamer. The appropriate way to make this argument is with bullet points: * An Arma mod on steroids is the most popular FPS on Steam. PlayerUnknown&apos;s Battlegrounds is a story generator that balances intense firefights with goofing around. It&apos;s a 100-person free-for-all on a massive map that also respects your time. This week PUBG is running its first major tournament at Gamescom, with a $350,000 prize pool. &#xA0;; * Even with PUBG alongside it, Arma 3&#x2014;an intricate and often demanding sim&#x2014;averages about 22,000 concurrent players daily. That&apos;s five times the playerbase it had at launch in 2013.&#xA0;; * Blizzard&apos;s first FPS is colorful, competitive, and inclusive. But maybe most noteworthy is the tenacity and transparency with which Blizzard has iterated on Overwatch over time: it&apos;s been patched <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/with-119-patches-overwatch-sets-the-bar-for-post-launch-support/\">; more than 120 times </a> since launch, with seven seasonal events so far.&#xA0; * Investment money is pouring into Blizzard&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-league-adds-new-teams-in-london-and-los-angeles/\">; Overwatch League </a>, which will hopefully lay the groundwork for stable team rosters and great tournaments. * Tribes isn&apos;t dead, <a href=\"https://www.playmidair.com/\">; it was just sleeping </a>. * Valve&apos;s support for CS:GO has been inconsistent, but the shooter has nevertheless cemented itself as an insanely deep competitive game. You could spend months working on your grenade technique alone. With its massive tournaments and a little help from <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\">; online gambling </a>, CS:GO has paved the way for all other FPS&apos; esports scenes. * Quake is back. Even with a free-to-play business model, rentable characters, and &apos;ultimate&apos; abilities attached to each champion, Quake Champions bunnyhops and talks like a pure Quake game. * One of the biggest game publishers in the world made a multiplayer-only, PC-first, tactical FPS and has supported it well for two years. Rainbow Six Siege has <a href=\"http://www.gamesradar.com/rainbow-six-siege-is-played-by-23-million-people-every-day-whats-its-secret/\">; 2.3M daily players </a> on all platforms. * One decade after Halo 2, Destiny 2 is coming to PC.&#xA0;; * Tripwire and Antimatter Games are quietly making some of the best FPSes on this list. Killing Floor 2, which just ran a great summer event, deserves some sort of blood-soaked Emmy for its gore system and gun animations. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam represents one of the best midpoints between authenticity and accessibility, continuing the series&apos; ambitious focus on asymmetry. * Battlefield 1, with easily the best infantry combat in the series, chugs along with paid expansions. * March&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/day-of-infamy-does-justice-to-the-classic-wwii-mod-that-inspired-it/\">; Day of Infamy </a> is a worthy successor to Day of Defeat, with great co-op to boot. * Unreal Tournament is being remade as a unique collaboration between modders and Epic. * Expect a major update to Team Fortress 2 when it turns 10 on October 10. * Call of Duty: WWII is getting a beta on PC. * 20 years after GoldenEye came out on Nintendo 64, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-creation-and-tireless-evolution-of-the-goldeneye-source-mod/\">; the best version </a> of it exists on PC and is maintained by a team of passionate fans. It&apos;s free. * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/lawbreakers-review/\">; LawBreakers is rather good </a>. * Most of these games are funded by cosmetic microtransactions that don&apos;t affect gameplay, rather than expansions or map packs that would fragment the player base. * The 144hz monitors you should play these games on <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-monitors/\">; are getting cheaper </a>.&#xA0; I&apos;m accepting counter-arguments in the comments.&#xA0; ",

Dwarf Fortress <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2006 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Wes Fenlon: </strong>In Dwarf Fortress I&#x2019;ve seen the circle of death and rebirth. It&#x2019;s less of a game, more of an ambitious simulation, representing the complexities of existence in ASCII. Eventually you&#x2019;ll feel like Neo, seeing the truth behind the symbols. Just remember: losing is fun. <strong>Shaun Prescott:</strong> You don&#x2019;t even need to play Dwarf Fortress to marvel at its achievement. Hell, the patch notes are a marvel of their own. 99. Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Fraser Brown:</strong> In Shadow Tactics, every infiltration of an enemy palace or compound is a puzzle overflowing with obstacles. Being sneaky is fun. Being murderous is better. Planning the demise of the game&#x2019;s guards is a singular delight. I&#x2019;m a fan of the ol&#x2019; tanuki distraction method&#x2014;the little critter distracts a guard by being adorable while one of my ninjas pounces on him from a roof. 98. Shadowrun: Dragonfall <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Jody Macgregor:</strong> It&#x2019;s funny that one of the few games to get cyberpunk right is also one with elves in it, but Shadowrun reduces fantasy and cyberpunk to their essentials while emphasising what&#x2019;s best about both. Dragonfall is basically Baldur&#x2019;s Gate 2 with turn-based combat set in near-future Berlin, where hackers and samurai raid corporations and watch a talk show hosted by a dragon. It&#x2019;s as great as it sounds. 97. FEAR <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2005 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Andy Chalk:</strong> Combat in FEAR is magnificent chaos. Glass shatters, dust billows, and sparks, paper, and body parts fly in loud, explosive gunfights against some of the finest, most believably &#x2018;real&#x2019; AI ever created for an FPS. Enemies flank, they take cover, they chatter and they toss grenades with infuriatingly good timing and accuracy. But what I love most about it is the way it weaves a genuinely horrific tale through all that action, breaking up the manic combat with intensely disturbing stretches of creepiness and a few moments worthy of any pure horror game. <strong>Andy Kelly:</strong> I reinstall FEAR at least once a year just to experience that amazing shotgun again. Every shooter has its own unique shotgun, but there&#x2019;s something immensely satisfying about the one in FEAR. How it violently kicks back when you fire it, and the exaggerated way enemies tumble when you shoot them in slow motion. I&#x2019;m not usually one for fetishising weapons, but I&#x2019;ll make an exception here. <strong>Steven Messner:</strong> Speaking of fetishising guns, how can we not talk about the 10mm HV Penetrator, the gun that fires giant steel stakes and crucifies enemies against walls? I get that FEAR&#x2019;s shotgun deserves a lot of praise, but to me the Penetrator is one of the greatest guns of all time. It&#x2019;s the perfect weapon to use against FEAR&#x2019;s ragdoll enemies. I used the gun so damn much that I feel like whoever had to go through after me and clean up all the dead bodies probably suffered some pretty severe trauma from seeing hundreds of people nailed to cubicle walls. 96. Grim Fandango Remastered <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Tom Senior:</strong> Manny Calavera is one of the coolest heroes in PC gaming, and he happens to live in one of the coolest worlds in PC gaming. It&#x2019;s a vibrant take on the afterlife, and a great place to set an epic noir love story. Even after all these years Grim Fandango is funny and is still worth everyone&#x2019;s time. Play it and enjoy the jokes. <strong>Andy K:</strong> I love it when you explore Rubacava in year two. Reading beat poetry at the Blue Casket, listening to Glottis play the piano in Manny&#x2019;s casino. It&#x2019;s like stepping into a classic film noir, albeit one populated by skeletons and giant bees. 95. Metro: Last Light <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Shaun: </strong>It seems wrong to describe a FPS set in a decrepit metro network as &#x2018;beautiful&#x2019;, but Last Light manages it. Between the often-unforgiving combat and the light-but-rewarding survival elements, this sequel manages to tell an engrossing tale which isn&#x2019;t at odds with the relentless violence involved. <strong>Samuel Roberts: </strong>Probably my favourite apocalypse in games&#x2014;it&#x2019;s realistically dour, yet still gorgeous and unsettling.&#xA0; 94. Spider &amp; Web <strong>RELEASED</strong> 1998 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Jody: </strong>This is a free text adventure that begins as a story about a guileless tourist, then frames that as a cover invented by a spy under interrogation, then continues switching between the game you play and the interrogator interrupting to say, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not what happened!&#x201D; Each flashback gets closer to a truth you the player wants to learn, but you the protagonist want to hide. It&#x2019;s clever, twisty, and explosive. 93. Nuclear Throne <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 74 <strong>Wes:</strong> Perhaps the greatest use of Early Access as a model for development, Nuclear Throne is a punchy top-down roguelike shooter honed over nearly 100 weekly updates. Like the best games of its type, what seems like a simple setup &#x2013; collect powerful guns, survive randomly generated levels as you progress to a final boss fight &#x2013; belies hidden stages and characters and secrets to give you the upper hand. The roster of heroes gives you so many different ways to play. I&#x2019;m partial to the samurai Chicken, who can briefly survive without his head, and the noob-friendly Crystal, who can reflect bullets. But the real reason to play this over other roguelikes is how great the action feels. It nails that rhythm of explosive action, bullets and enemies flying towards you, with brief moments of respite as you inch towards whatever&#x2019;s around the corner. Action anxiety perfected. 92. Nidhogg <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Tyler Wilde: </strong>The best sickly-looking fencing game there is, Nidhogg speeds up the mind games and finesse of Street Fighter, chaining tiny, rapid duels between stabby pixel people into hilarious, constantly tense tug-of-war sessions. <strong>Joe Donnelly:</strong> Don&#x2019;t let appearances fool you: beneath the modest veneer lies a deep and engaging versus mode masterpiece. Be it tactful fencing, aerial karate kicking, sword javelin tossing, or turning tail and running&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a strategy for everyone as you push your stick-figured foe back one screen at a time, spawning at either side as you die and regenerate, regenerate and die. Nidhogg also comes with a less enjoyable singleplayer mode that can be wrapped up inside half an hour. Often hilarious, but equally known to bring out the competitive streak in any payer who enters the fray. Be prepared to lose friends over this one. &#xA0; 91: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2004 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry <strong>Fraser: </strong>Everything &#x2018;Star Wars&#x2019; about it is subverted. The result is one of the most interesting yarns in the franchise, peeling back a lot of the fantastical elements of Star Wars and exploring them. <strong>Samuel Roberts:</strong> As I watch the new films I feel like they&#x2019;re not showing us anything we haven&#x2019;t seen before. Perhaps that&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;ve been spoiled by KOTOR II, where there&#x2019;s more nuance in the portrayal of the force and memorable characters.&#xA0; <strong>Wes:</strong> The buggiest game I&#x2019;ve ever completed, even with the essential fan patches. Still worth it for Kreia. 90. Team Fortress 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2007 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 20 <strong>Evan Lahti:</strong> What began as a class-based FPS was transformed into a free-to-play platform for mapmaking, hats, and machinima with a horde mode, events, and a number of bird heads that you can unlock. Valve&#x2019;s learnings from TF2 helped transform PC gaming at large. <strong>Phil Savage:</strong> This is the lowest TF2 has placed on our list by some margin, but that a decade-old multiplayer FPS appears at all is downright heroic. TF2 is eternal. 89. Euro Truck Simulator 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 82 <strong>Andy K: </strong>This makes it into our top 100 every year, with good reason. On paper it sounds boring, but there&#x2019;s something hypnotic about hauling goods across its beautiful recreation of Europe. <strong>Phil: </strong>I slightly prefer American Truck Simulator&#x2019;s vast, desolate atmosphere, but ETS2 remains the brighter star, thanks mostly to the size and variety of its continental recreation. This is a huge, relaxing world to travel through. 88.&#xA0;Resident Evil 7 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Tim Clark:</strong> Few series live long enough to reinvent themselves successfully once, let alone a second time. But that&#x2019;s exactly the dark miracle Resi has pulled off&#x2014;first with Resi 4, which redefined its predecessors&#x2019; clunky third-person exploration into frantic crowd control, and now with this, which has breathed terrifying new life into the haunted house schtick. The switch to first-person, though obvious given the success of indie shockers like Outlast and Amnesia, still feels bold and thrilling. Much of that is down to the unhinged Baker family, each of whom must be faced in their own grand encounter, the best of which are frontloaded towards the start of the game. The generic baddies and a undercooked final act let things down, but the sense is still of a series which has, again, found its feet, even if it&#x2019;s still waist deep in oily viscera. 87. Kentucky Route Zero <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 100 <strong>Joe:</strong> The fact that Kentucky Route Zero has only launched four of its five chapters speaks volumes for its placing on this list. Here&#x2019;s a game that&#x2019;s yet to be finished, but rubs shoulders with the best PC gaming has to offer. Alongside its cast of idiosyncratic characters, it weaves themes of self-reflection, discovery and the supernatural into its world. Relatable vignettes and playful metaphors stand before a stylish art style. Whereas a sense of dread underpins Acts 1 through 3, KRZ&#x2019;s penultimate entry eschews its wider picture to focus on the minutiae of each scenario&#x2014;and its Twain-esque jaunt down the river hones in on the imperfections of your dysfunctional crew. The as-yet unannounced Act 5 will mark the end of the road for Kentucky Route Zero, yet what&#x2019;s come before it is nothing short of wonderful. 86. Guild Wars 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 45 <strong>Phil: </strong>Guild Wars 2 is what happens when you take over a decade&#x2019;s worth of MMO wisdom and decide to do something better. What if instead of looking for quest givers who ask you to kill ten boars, you collaborated with an entire map to complete objectives that build towards a big boss monster and a chest full of loot? What if instead of being inconvenienced by low-level friends, you were rewarded for partnering up and having a good time? What if instead of paying a subscription, the base game was free? This is one of the most generous MMOs around, and ArenaNet&#x2019;s experimentation continues, even now. From rebuilding its central city from scratch, to releasing new story chapters, Guild Wars 2 is always building towards something new and exciting. <strong>Tom S:</strong> Its dazzling world hosts some of the best combat in the genre. Attacks are template-based and dodging matters. I&#x2019;ve had a blast taking on enormous bosses with my necromancer and dozens of other warriors. Its events are huge pile-ons that create amazing spectacles and a sense of community. 85.&#xA0;Rising Storm&#xA0; <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 79 <strong>Evan:</strong> It blends fragility and power better than any FPS of its kind. As a Japanese soldier on Iwo Jima, I like to smuggle a MG behind my opponents, get prone and drop as many unaware attackers as I can. Real war is unfair, and Rising Storm manages to make a fun game out of its asymmetries. <strong>Tyler:</strong> Life in Rising Storm is 90% war movie extra and 10% leading role. 84.&#xA0;Terraria <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2011 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 42 <strong>Tom Marks: </strong>Like the finest wine or the smelliest cheese, Terraria keeps on getting better with age. It&#x2019;s staggering to look back at everything that&#x2019;s been added since it launched&#x2014;a stream of updates has introduced over 3,000 items, new biomes, bosses and countless other improvements. It&#x2019;s dense with exciting things to do and discover, and there&#x2019;s sure to be even more by this time next year. 83. Darkest Dungeon <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 53 <strong>Evan: </strong>As you lose men to madness, syphilis, heart attacks, vampiric blood thirst or other maladies, you&#x2019;ll come to the realisation that you shouldn&#x2019;t treat your adventurers as precious assets to be cared for, but as batteries in the shape of men. That gives the game a different emotional texture: you&#x2019;re not a faithful commander, you&#x2019;re a brutal middle-manager. I love its artistic cohesion and the genius use of a single, ominous narrator (Wayne June) throughout the game to set the mood and speak for the characters, enemies, and the dungeon-as-character. 82.&#xA0;Cities: Skylines <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 89 <strong>Fraser:</strong> Why is building roads so compelling? There&#x2019;s a lot going on in Cities: Skylines, Colossal Order&#x2019;s city builder, but getting the teeming masses to their destinations scratches an itch like nothing else. I&#x2019;m diversifying into blimps now. Seeing my citizens politely queueing up in their thousands to take to the skies makes me a happy mayor. Sure, I had to bulldoze a school to make room for one of the stations, but now all the children are being educated by floating billboards. <strong>Phil:</strong> Fraser&#x2019;s populace is doing a lot better than the occupants of my last town, many of whom died after a sewage disaster. But when I&#x2019;m not battling a tide of brown water, I love the degree of fine-tuning that Cities: Skylines supports. The zoning system is inspired&#x2014;enabling experimentation by letting you earmark a part of your town for farming, nightlife or legal pot use. 81. Killing Floor 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Evan: </strong>Flick an RPG into a crowd of zeds and watch intestines, bile, and whole torsos vomit out the blast radius. It&#x2019;s zombie bowling made by gun nerds, with gaming&#x2019;s best slow-motion inviting you to savour every frame. <strong>Hannah Dwan: </strong>Is there a game that makes tearing apart monstrosities as fun as Killing Floor 2? It&#x2019;s the best and most surprisingly diverse horde mode anyone&#x2019;s ever made. 80. Minecraft <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2009 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 20 <strong>Chris Livingston: </strong>The ultimate game for popping in for a few minutes and then looking around blearily when you realise a dozen hours have passed. Its world can be whatever you want it to be: a singleplayer crafting and exploration game, or a multiplayer sandbox experience. Throw in thousands of mods, custom games and speciality servers, and the near-infinite world of Minecraft gets even bigger. 79. Warhammer: End Times&#x2014;Vermintide <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Matthew: </strong>This is more than Left 4 Dead with rat men&#x2014;a characterful recreation of The Old World you&#x2019;ll want to stop and explore (though the rats will devour you). Each character is a distillation of a Warhammer race, and watching them interact is a treat. The humour contrasts nicely with the hopelessness of it all.&#xA0; <strong>Evan:</strong> It&#x2019;s a Warhammer B-movie in the best way possible. 78.&#xA0;Nethack <strong>RELEASED</strong> 1987 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Wes:</strong> Roguelike once literally meant &#x2018;like the game Rogue&#x2019;, the ASCII dungeon crawler made for &#x2019;80s mainframes. But most modern roguelikes owe more to its descendant NetHack, first released in 1987 (and still updated and actively played to this day). The simple graphics allow for a deep dungeon crawler compared to any other I&#x2019;ve played. Why pick a lock when you can kick down a door? Why eat a pie when you can use it to blind an enemy? If you value mystery and discovery in games, nothing does them better than NetHack. Play online on nethack.alt.org to encounter the remains of other players who never made it out of the dungeon&#x2019;s depths. 77.&#xA0;Overcooked <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Evan:</strong> The best same-screen co-op game on PC. This would be higher if it worked well as a singleplayer game. <strong>Phil:</strong> Shamefully, I have watched a lot of Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen USA. Overcooked is like if Ramsey&#x2019;s competition was more cartoony and collaborative, with less swearing&#x2014;most of the time. Success requires coordination of resources and time&#x2014;which almost always results in glorious culinary chaos. 76.&#xA0;Doom II <strong>RELEASED</strong> 1994 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 69 <strong>Chris L:</strong> Rather than trying to reinvent the original, Doom II just gave us a heavier dose of everything we wanted: more monsters and bigger levels. It&#x2019;s still an utter blast to play. <strong>Phil</strong>: Doom II boasts incredible mod support. You can warp the campaign with over-the-top effects, or you can enjoy the many total conversions, from the The Adventures of Square, to the incredible WolfenDoom. 75.&#xA0;Sunless Sea <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Fraser:</strong> In Sunless Sea, you get a vulnerable ship and a sinister ocean to explore. There&#x2019;s action, trading and permadeath, but what really defines Failbetter&#x2019;s nautical romp is the exceptional writing. It jumps between whimsy and menace. One moment you&#x2019;re solving a dispute between rats and guinea pigs, the next your crew are eating each other. It&#x2019;s a game about crafting weird, tragic stories. The captain-turned-spy who made one too many enemies in the east. The explorer who risked everything to climb out of the Unterzee and back to the surface. There are countless paths, all leading to strange places. <strong>Andy K:</strong> The mystery of what lies on each island is what keeps me pushing through the many hardships. A gruelling game, but worth enduring for the wonderful stories you&#x2019;re told whenever you dock somewhere. 74.&#xA0;VVVVV <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>James Davenport: </strong>You flip gravity (by pressing the V key) to bounce up and down between the floor and ceiling avoiding spikes (they look like this: VVVVVV) while exploring a psychedelic 8-bit open world in pursuit of your friends, Violent, Vermillion, Victoria, Verdigris, and Vitellary. Developer Terry Cavanagh created VVVVVV as an experiment in level design &#x2013; abilities never change, but how surfaces behave and the conditions of the world change constantly. In one stretch, thin lines throw you about like gravity-defying trampolines, and in another the level scrolls on its own, forcing you to think quickly. In one lonely corner of the map, a massive elephant cries. All you can do there is frown. But it&#x2019;s hard to stay down with such a buoyant soundtrack. It&#x2019;s one earworm after another, an assembly of upbeat, catchy chiptunes that still haunt me today.&#xA0; 73.&#xA0;Ladykiller In A Bind <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Hannah: </strong>When I say Ladykiller in a Bind is a NSFW visual novel about horny teenagers, there&#x2019;s probably a certain image people generally imagine: crude, poorly written, and often embarrassing, the gaming equivalent of that time you found an adult magazine in the local park. Ladykiller In A Bind goes against that with smart writing, enjoyable characters, and lifelike depictions of intimacy (or, the chaos of it). It&#x2019;s aware of the stereotype, and so does its best to dismantle it by portraying those teenage years with the maturity of a game designed for those a little older. 72.&#xA0;Fallout 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 1998 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Jody: </strong>The original Fallout nailed an atmosphere of black comedy, combining post-apocalyptic grit with goofy retrofuturism. It also nailed the RPG standard of having three solutions to a problem, but where other games went with &#x2018;violent&#x2019;, &#x2018;sneaky&#x2019;, and &#x2018;magical&#x2019; solutions, Fallout replaced the third option with &#x2018;diplomatic&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s as good a game about talking your way out of trouble as has ever been made. 71.&#xA0;Valkyria Chronicles <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 49 <strong>Tom M:</strong> Even though it arrived on PC late, Valkyria Chronicles is still one the freshest takes on a strategy game I&#x2019;ve seen. It&#x2019;s a mix of turn-based strategy, third-person shooter and JRPG that, against all odds, comes together to form an cohesive whole. The art style and melodramatic story don&#x2019;t scream &#x2018;hardcore strategy&#x2019;, but underneath all that is a one-of-a-kind tactics game that shouldn&#x2019;t be overlooked.&#xA0; 70.&#xA0;Bastion&#xA0; <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2011 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Jody:</strong> Bastion is an action RPG with trimmings so wonderful we sometimes overlook the strong combat at its centre. You carry two weapons, and each is balanced for multiple situations. Control schemes can be tweaked, and the challenge shrines are a neat way of tweaking difficulty. Those trimmings are wonderful, though: the city that rebuilds itself, the narrator who responds to your actions, the perfect soundtrack and the story that reaches a genuinely affecting conclusion. <strong>Phil:</strong> The worldbuilding is exceptional&#x2014;and not just in the immediate sense, as levels tend to literally build themselves around you. The songs the characters sing are pulled from the history of the world Supergiant has created, and imbued with a deeper meaning that feeds back into the more immediate story. It really helps sell the emotions behind the drama that unfolds. 69.&#xA0;N++ <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Shaun: </strong>Ah, the primal gaming pleasure of running and jumping to the end of a level. That&#x2019;s essentially all you do in N++, but it&#x2019;s incredible just how varied this platformer feels despite having over 1,500 levels and an artstyle as barebones as they come. The star attraction of the N series&#x2014;which started off as a Flash game&#x2014;has always been the floaty movement of its stick-figured ninja, who feels so good to direct that it barely matters how many thousands of times you&#x2019;ll die. And while it&#x2019;s true that &#x2018;running&#x2019; and &#x2018;jumping&#x2019; is basically all you do in N++, it&#x2019;s the subtlety in the way these actions are executed that matters&#x2014;momentum and timing is important, but crucially, luck never is. Add to all this a cooperative mode and a level editor, and it feels like N++ is just about the last twitch platformer we&#x2019;ll ever need. Or, at least, it seems a tough task to top it. 68. System Shock 2 <strong>RELEASED</strong> 1999 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Andy C:</strong> This has everything: guns, hacking, frightening enemies, a tale of betrayal, a pumping soundtrack, ambiance and a villain who makes the greatest videogame entrance ever. Throw on one of the updated texture packs and you&#x2019;ve got a game that&#x2019;s as brilliant now as it was in 1999. <strong>Tom S: </strong>The enemy models aren&#x2019;t chilling now, but the sense of struggle is intact. The Von Braun is still an interesting place to master, and the splicing of shooter/RPG systems just works. Games like Dishonored have since taken the formula to new heights, but even that game can&#x2019;t match the tension of this ingenious original. <strong>Phil:</strong> Part of what makes that so effective is the soundtrack is one of the great &#x2019;90s videogame scores. Sparse and creepy, it&#x2019;s instrumental in defining System Shock 2&#x2019;s style. 67. Fez <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 55 <strong>Phil:</strong> A relaxing platformer that&#x2019;s filled with fiendish secrets. On the surface, Fez is a charming game about rotating a 2D world to complete puzzles and create new routes. But scratch beneath its surface, and Fez reveals its heart. You&#x2019;ll translate languages, decode runes and break through the fourth wall. It&#x2019;s meticulously constructed, and all set to a soundtrack that builds a lasting, memorable sense of place. 66. Plants Vs Zombies <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2009 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Chris L: </strong>Charming, challenging and endearing, defend your home from zombies with an army of deadly plants &#x2013; like corn cannons, exploding cherries, and hypnotic mushrooms. It&#x2019;s masterfully balanced, introducing new threats and defences at the perfect pace that brings what at times feels like a casual and colourful war to a nail-biting conclusion. PvZ is tower defence at its finest and funniest.&#xA0; 65. Burnout Paradise&#xA0; <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2009 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 66 <strong>Hannah:</strong> Which Burnout game is the best is a tricky topic, but I&#x2019;m adamant it&#x2019;s Burnout Paradise. A great variety of streets to race down, loads of cars to unlock and, oh baby, the destruction when a car gets wrecked. Wheels bend into the wrong directions, metal shards ping off, all in glorious slow motion. The regular obliteration of cars is the icing on the cake to the most well designed arcade driving game ever. 64.&#xA0;Pillars of Eternity <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 59 <strong>Joe: </strong>With a wonderful story that&#x2019;s bolstered by an intuitive battle system, Pillars of Eternity echoes roleplaying stalwarts such as Icewind Dale, Baldur&#x2019;s Gate and Fallout. A classic.&#xA0; <strong>Andy K: </strong>As someone who grew up with Infinity Engine RPGs, playing something that captures their distinctive magic, but with a modern sheen, was a delight. Deep, rich, and compelling, roleplaying on PC doesn&#x2019;t get much better. 63. Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2003 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Samuel: </strong>There&#x2019;s not a single cover shooter around that&#x2019;s more fun than Remedy&#x2019;s bullet time sequel, in my opinion (there&#x2019;s perhaps an argument for Vanquish). Diving into every enemy-filled room with two pistols blazing is like a puzzle to solve, and the sound design and feedback of the guns is terrific. Its noir styling is at once ironic and sincere, and I still love it. You can pop Gears of War in the bin, thanks.&#xA0; 62.&#xA0;Ori and the Blind Forest <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New <strong>Katharine Byrne: </strong>The cute critters in Moon Studio&#x2019;s platformer will make you go d&#x2019;aww almost as often as the nails hard platforming makes you go arghhh. Its Studio Ghibli-esque animation and soaring soundtrack are both top of their class, and the ability to slingshot Ori off enemy attacks brings something genuinely new to the platforming table, making me very excited for its upcoming sequel.&#xA0; 61.&#xA0;Undertale <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 92 <strong>Matthew:</strong> There&#x2019;s something about Undertale&#x2019;s subversive, retro take on the top-down RPG that sweeps you up and takes you back to a place that&#x2019;s half nightmare, half adventure. It recalls the best and worst of fairy tales &#x2013; a mix of excitement and understated menace &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s brought to life by a smart sense of humour that makes the whole thing strangely relatable. It&#x2019;s particularly essential for anyone who&#x2019;s skipped classic games for fear of standardised JRPG tropes &#x2013; turn-based combat is tweaked with bullet hell minigames and you can bond with the monsters you face in battle instead of straight-up slaughtering them in cold blood. The sacred foundation stones of an entire genre are smashed and rebuilt into something genuinely unique, and the result is a game that anyone can engage with. It&#x2019;s a strange, wonderful and curiously nostalgic experience: however old you are, playing Undertale will make you feel like a plucky youngster trying EarthBound for the first time. <strong>Steven: </strong>I absolutely adore Undertale&#x2019;s combat system. It&#x2019;s often overshadowed by the story and characters but as someone who knows the pain of sitting through yet another turn-based fight with the same enemies, Undertale&#x2019;s combat never feels like a slog. It&#x2019;s a system on par with Super Mario RPG for the SNES, where every attack and block can double its efficacy by carefully timed button presses. But in Undertale, you move a little heart around bullet hell minigames, transforming the combat from a passive experience into an active one. Turn-based combat systems are historically all about rolling dice and thinking one step ahead, but again Undertale subverts expectations while still feeling true to the source material. <strong>Tyler:</strong> It&#x2019;s about fandom and death of the author, self-interested themes that could&#x2019;ve made for an indulgent misery. But love for games flows through Undertale, and it instantly endeared itself to me. Run from almost every game that parodies games except for this one. 60. Planescape: Torment <strong>RELEASED</strong> 1999 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 34 <strong>Tyler: </strong>This should be higher. Maybe it will be, next year, after I launch a campaign to force everyone affiliated with PC Gamer to play the remastered version&#x2014;which, thankfully, doesn&#x2019;t tamper with a single line of dialogue. Torment is a witty, weird RPG that emphasises story and dialogue, and is filled with surprising events that feel like they could&#x2019;ve been made up by a clever DM on the spot. I remember, early on, how you can let an embalmer who thinks you&#x2019;re a zombie fill you with stitches&#x2014;increasing your max HP. Every little thing matters, nothing is filler, no sidequest is boring. 59.&#xA0;World of Warcraft <strong>RELEASED</strong> 2004 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 68 <strong>Leif Johnson:</strong> WoW has some fantastic competition these days, but it remains the MM...",

        "contents": "Deadly up close and accurate over distance, pistols have played a huge role in the recent meta of <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-chickens/\" target=\"_blank\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>. After months of outcry from several pro players about the balance of the game&apos;s most popular pistols, it is no surprise that Valve has begun to make changes to the game&apos;s arsenal. At the moment pistol and eco rounds are unpredictable situations where either side can win, despite a gear disadvantage. Even though Valve has committed to addressing these problems, while encouraging more skilled plays, there is still a long way to go before the community&#x2014;and the professionals&#x2014;regard the arsenal as balanced. With the Tec-9 reduced to a sharpshooting role, the popularity of the Dual Berettas has risen. The <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-kicks-off-csgo-pistol-changes-with-tec-9-nerf/\" target=\"_blank\">recent changes</a>, which will hopefully bring the average game back to more tactical methods rather than the typical run and gun, began with alterations to the Terrorist&#x2019;s go-to pistol&#x2014;the Tec-9. The 500RPM semi-automatic sidearm is a staple at all levels of play, and can kill a fully armoured player with a single shot to the head. It&apos;s mainly used in eco and anti-eco situations, at the start of the game or where the team&#x2019;s money is running low. The changes to the pistol meant the usual left-click spray as you rush onto a bombsite no longer worked. Initially referred to as a nerf but can be more accurately described as a rework to the way the pistol operates, the patch increased the Tec-9&apos;s first shot accuracy, meaning that tap firing is now the way forward. The magazine has also been reduced from 24 rounds to 18. This has altered the identity of the Tec-9. Instead of using it as a crude, run-and-gun spam weapon, the gun now behaves a bit more like a Desert Eagle, except its one-taps can be hit while running or strafing. With the Tec-9 now reduced to a sharpshooting role, the popularity of the Dual Berettas has risen. Costing the same amount as the Tec-9 at $500, the Berettas can take 86 hit points off the head of an armoured player, and some in CS:GO&apos;s community believe that they will be buffed to fill the gap left by the Tec-9. To balance the changes on the Counter-Terrorists side, changes were eventually made to the Five-SeveN pistol on August 15 to reward &#x201C;tactical positioning and defensive play.&#x201D; The pistol, which costs $500, is the Counter-Terrorist counterpart to the Tec-9, so it&apos;s no surprise that the CT sidearm also received a major change. Now the pistol, which is renowned for its large clip and spray accuracy, has been made even more deadly.&#xA0; Players spraying with the Five-SeveN have seen slightly improved accuracy but the biggest difference can be felt on defense, when wielding the pistol against enemies who are pushing onto a bombsite. The difficulty for many Counter-Terrorists on eco or pistol rounds is shutting down a rush (where you&apos;re usually outnumbered) while the rest of your team rotates, and I think these changes will help. CTs should theoretically be able to hold the bomb sites easier, with improved spray accuracy, but pushes will be penalised&#x2014;and rightly so. Valve&#x2019;s quick patches to the pistols indicate more changes to pistols are imminent and some are calling for the powerful but cheap P250, which can inflict more damage against armoured opponents than the Glock-18, the P2000 or the USP-S, to be examined. Up close, the P250 can kill an armoured player with a single shot. Strangely, the $3,100 M4A4 rifle at the same range will not, a difference in firepower that epitomises the need for changes. One thing&apos;s for sure&#x2014;we won&#x2019;t know exactly how much the structure of the game will be affected until all the changes roll out and CS:GO is run through the filter of a high-level tournament, which tend to reveal any advantages that exist in the game.

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\">CS:GO</a>&apos;s Tec-9 is often the pistol of choice on the Terrorist side: it&apos;s cheap, deals decent damage and has a high rate of fire. But now Valve has announced a nerf to the gun that will kickstart wider changes to pistols in the game. It wants to &quot;emphasise skillful use of the weapons&quot;, you see. While the Tec-9&apos;s first shot will be slightly more accurate, spraying down an enemy will be more difficult because accuracy when firing rapidly will be reduced. The magazine and reserve ammo capacity will drop to 18 and 90, from 24 and 120 respectively.&#xA0; The changes will &quot;emphasise aiming while retaining the weapon&#x2019;s high mobility&quot;, Valve says&#x2014;basically, you&apos;ll have to pick your shots rather than just spamming left click. The changes, now in beta, were announced on <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2017/08/19215/\" target=\"_blank\">the CS:GO blog</a>. There&apos;s no details yet on what pistol is up next, or how other weapons will be changed, but expect similar tweaks soon.&#xA0; So, in preparation, why not read <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-pistol-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Fredrik&apos;s guide for improving your pistol play</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/choosing-the-right-pistol-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\">Stefan&apos;s guide</a> to choosing the right weapon?

The exploit was identified by <a href=\"https://oneupsecurity.com/research/remote-code-execution-in-source-games\">One Up Security</a> (via <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nevmwd/counter-strike-bug-allowed-hackers-to-completely-own-your-computer-with-a-frag\">Motherboard</a>) who notified Valve.&#xA0; &quot;Valve&apos;s Source SDK contained a buffer overflow vulnerability which allowed remote code execution on clients and servers,&quot; OUP&apos;s statement reads. &quot;The vulnerability was exploited by fragging a player, which caused a specially crafted ragdoll model to be loaded.&#xA0; Multiple Source games were updated during the month of June 2017 to fix the vulnerability. Titles included CS:GO, TF2, Hl2:DM, Portal 2, and L4D2. We thank Valve for being very responsive and taking care of vulnerabilites swiftly. Valve patched and released updates for their more popular titles within a day.&quot; For a demonstration of how it worked, this <a href=\"https://oneupsecuritycdn-8266.kxcdn.com/static/blog/hl2-rce/rat.mp4\">very short video tells you all you need to know</a>.

        "contents": "Following an Esports Integrity Coalition survey on &quot;community opinion on the appropriate sanctions for those caught cheating in esports,&quot; ESL has announced a decision to <a href=\"https://www.eslgaming.com/article/esl-aligns-esic-s-recommendation-sanctions-cheating-esports-3641\">lift its lifetime ban</a> on players, including those of the former iBUYPOWER team, who were caught throwing matches.&#xA0; The sorry tale stretches back to early 2015, when <a href=\"https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/match-fixing-counter-strike-ibuypower-netcode-guides-1256\">Daily Dot</a> posted evidence of collusion between CS:GO teams iBUYPOWER and NetcodeGuides.com to fix matches and then place bets on their outcome. Following a deeper investigation, Valve issued an &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\">indefinite</a>&quot; ban against the involved players, an injunction that both ESL and ESEA said they would uphold. Valve later clarified that the bans were in fact &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-makes-csgo-match-fixing-bans-permanent/\">permanent</a>.&quot;&#xA0; But the ESIC survey found that, while match-fixing is cheating and cheating is bad, the CS:GO community doesn&apos;t really see it as an especially big deal. &quot;It is clear from the hundreds of &apos;FreeIBP,&apos; &apos;FreeSWAG,&apos; and &apos;FreeBRAX&apos; comments that a very significant number feel that the lifetime bans handed out in the IBP and other historic match-fixing cases were too harsh and, while a significant number of comments support lifetime bans for such activity overall, many more are critical of the publisher&#x2019;s decision in these cases,&quot; it wrote in its Statement on <a href=\"http://www.esportsintegrity.com/2017/07/24/esic-statement-on-appropriate-sanction-for-cheating-in-esports/\">Appropriate Sanction for Cheating in Esports</a>.&#xA0; &quot;ESIC is concerned that the community does not regard match-fixing as serious an offense as cheating to win. ESIC believes that match-fixing is as serious as cheating to win and is, consequently, committed to engaging with the community to try and persuade them that their current perception ought, perhaps, to change.&quot;&#xA0; The community&apos;s willingness to overlook the transgression is not &quot;the only view that matters,&quot; but combined with a review of the &quot;publicly available facts,&quot; it led ESIC to recommend that the lifetime bans be lifted on August 1 of this year. &#xA0;&#xA0; &quot;Our reasoning here is that, whilst the players are clearly culpable and should have known better, the rules surrounding this sort of activity were not clear at the time, no education had been provided to the players, and the procedures used to sanction them were not transparent and did not comply with principles of natural justice,&quot; it wrote.&#xA0; ESL said in its own statement that it and the ESEA held their own meeting with CS:GO pros in June, as part of the ESIC process, to get their perspective on the matter. As a result, ESL said it will &quot;align its official stance on the topic with ESIC&#x2019;s guidance&quot;: Rules for all IEM, ESL One, ESL Pro League, and ESEA Leagues and amateur events will be updated to reflect the recommendations, and &quot;all indefinite match-fixing bans placed on players before February 15, 2015, have been lifted,&quot; including those of former iBUYPOWER players.&#xA0; &quot;We believe that integrity and fair play are of the utmost importance in esports, and our updated catalogue of sanctions reflects that commitment&#x201D;, ESL senior vice president Ulrich Schulze said. The slate isn&apos;t being wiped completely clean, however: &#x201D;All of these adjustments do not apply to bans and punishments issued by Valve directly though, which will still be in place for all Valve sponsored tournaments run by ESL, such as Majors.&#x201D;&#xA0; Addressing the issue of unclear rules, ESL also announced that it will adopt ESIC&apos;s recommended sanctions for future offenses.&#xA0; * <strong>Cheating: </strong>Disqualification from the tournament, results voided, forfeiture of prize money, ban between 2 year and lifetime depending on age and level of player and nature/size of tournament and how the player cheated (this offence includes &#x201C;smurfing&#x201D; where both parties involved are liable to sanctions). Cheating at a competition played above an amateur level (i.e. where significant prize pool is involved or qualification for a professional event is at stake) should normally result in a 5 year ban, but, in aggravating circumstances, can result in a lifetime ban. * <strong>Match-Fixing/betting fraud: </strong>Results voided, 5 year ban unless significant mitigating factors in line with the ESIC Anti-Corruption Code or, in the presence of aggravating circumstances, a longer ban, forfeiture of prize money and monetary fine (if discovered before the end of a tournament, disqualification). * <strong>Doping:</strong> Results voided, ban of between 1 and 2 years, forfeiture of prize money (if discovered before the end of a tournament, disqualification). * <strong>Competition manipulation and bribery:</strong> Results voided, ban of between 1 and 2 years, forfeiture of prize money and monetary fine (if discovered before the end of a tournament, disqualification). The above penalties will be applied for first offenses. For subsequent offenses, ESL and ESC warned that &quot;participants should expect far harsher sanctions and, in the cases of (a) and (b) above, in all likelihood, a lifetime ban from esports.&quot;&#xA0; ESL said in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-19-more-csgo-players-for-match-fixing/\">February 2015</a> that it would abide by Valve&apos;s bans against the players in question, &quot;until these cases are reviewed by Valve.&quot; That clearly happened last year, when the bans were declared permanent&#x2014;and while this might be backing into it a bit, that presumably opened the door for ESL and ESEA to chart its own course, and ultimately lift the bans. I&apos;ve emailed Valve to ask if it plans to grant a reprieve of its own, and will update if I receive a reply.&#xA0; ",

        "contents": "Counter-Strike&apos;s AI bots are universally terrible&#x2014;that&apos;s what most players would have you believe, at least. But during a ranked match on the third-party <a href=\"https://www.faceit.com/en\"> Faceit community league </a>, one bot rose to glory by single-handedly killing every player on the enemy team. BOT Connor is his name, and shaming seasoned Counter-Strike players is his game. Scoring an ace is a rare thing for even pro Counter-Strike players, but having a bot go all John Wick on the enemy team is practically unheard of. That&apos;s exactly what happened this weekend and Czech player &apos;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syM0RhUIMeQ\"> Kosta </a>&apos; was there to capture the incredible killing streak. Here&apos;s the video.&#xA0; I think that BOT Connor won this game for us. If you're losing and the bot wins this super important round, it's just insane. Kosta If you&apos;re unfamiliar with Global Offensive, bots will frequently fill open slots in teams when they are down a player. Aside from being a meat shield, they&apos;re not overly useful. They&apos;ll respond to preset commands and can sometimes get a kill, but as soon as a human player dies, they&apos;ll usually take command of the bot. But BOT Connor doesn&apos;t need a human puppet-master pulling his strings because he&apos;s a goddamn pro. During the match on de_mirage, BOT Connor leads the charge to defend bombsite A. After tossing a flashbang towards the tunnel known as &apos;t ramp,&apos; he immediately rushes in. In the span of five seconds, he scores a kill against one of the terrorists, presses into the ramp, jumps in the air, and scores a second, mid-air kill. As the players on the counter-terrorist team lose their minds over what they just witnessed, BOT Connor scores a third kill. With that part of the map clear, he then turns around, climbs a ladder, and kills the remaining two players. All of this happens in the span of 45 seconds and it&apos;s absolutely savage to watch. The counter-terrorists were down by one and the terrorists only needed another two wins, and this kill by BOT Connor tied the game up. I tracked down Kosta on Facebook and he informed me that BOT Connor inspired the team so much that they managed to come back and win the game. &quot;I think that BOT Connor won this game for us,&quot; Kosta writes. &quot;If you&apos;re losing and the bot wins this super important round, it&apos;s just insane.&quot; &quot;I thought it was hilarious,&quot; Richochetbang told me. He was another counter-terrorist player from the match. You can hear him laughing his ass off as BOT Connor begins his rampage. &quot;Every time he shot a guy they were caught off guard.&quot; While that appears to be true for a few of Connor&apos;s kills, most players aren&apos;t willing to cut the terrorist team much slack. This match took place on the third-party Faceit community league. Like ESEA, it&apos;s a place for more dedicated CS players to gather and features its own matchmaking, anti-cheat, and rankings. The terrorists&apos; average ranking is 4.4, which is decent (Faceit ranks go up to 10). Considering these leagues attract a more serious audience, you wouldn&apos;t expect them to put up such a weak defense against a rogue AI. But hey, we all have bad days. Some are just way worse than others. ",

        "contents": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an outstanding esport, and deservedly recognized as the top competitive shooter on the market. But despite the community&#x2019;s best efforts, it didn&#x2019;t quite make the shortlist for Steam&#x2019;s coveted <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-announces-winners-of-first-ever-steam-awards/\"> Best Use Of A Farm Animal award </a>. &#xA0; If you&#x2019;ve ever fired up CS:GO&apos;s deathmatch mode, you&#x2019;ve probably noted an epidemic of chickens plaguing the server. Relegated to target practice in most players&apos; minds, it&#x2019;s about time these long-running birds got the recognition they deserve. From zombification to the time a chicken got a professional player killed, let&apos;s reflect on the ways our feathered friends have embedded themselves in Counter-Strike&#x2019;s history. Festive feathers With the changing of the seasons, so too comes the inevitable swathe of holiday updates for our favourite online games. But where others run huge events, reworking levels or modes and adding unique player skins, CS:GO has, well, chickens. Since Halloween 2013, Valve has patched the little mascots to match the mood, festooning chickens with all manner of spooky or festive gear. Starting with an adorable, <a href=\"https://i.imgflip.com/1g0lo9.gif\"> bed-sheet ghost costume </a>, chickens have donned Christmas jumpers, pumpkin heads, antlers and more. Each update included its own quirks, from bunnyhopping chickens at Easter, to death-confetti for CS:GO&#x2019;s anniversary. The most impressive change came on Halloween 2014, when patch notes ominously listed: &#x201C;When there&#x2019;s no more room in chicken hell...&#x201D; Players soon discovered that chickens no longer remained dead when shot, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KZuivjyXCA\">rising from the grave in ghoulish green</a> to stalk both the battlefield and your nightmares. Okay, it was mostly adorable, but they&#x2019;re trying their best. A history of hens Counter-Strike&#x2019;s love-hate affair with these iconic birds stretches far back to the days of CS 1.6, where two chickens could be found feeding in cs_italy&#x2019;s market. These early birds were incapable of moving, pecking on the spot until killed. However, despite their limitations, players quickly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzrPye7aKo8\"> took a shine to them </a>. Chickens returned in Condition Zero&#x2019;s singleplayer, Deleted Scenes, which contained <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6JHp8bJhbZw?t=136\"> two hidden chickens as easter eggs. </a> Sadly, upon the release of Counter-Strike: Source in 2004, the popular birds were nowhere to be found, and Counter-Strike&#x2019;s mascot appeared to be plucked from the game forever. Until the 2012 launch of CS:GO.&#xA0; The long-awaited return was a clear point of celebration to the development team, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/csgo_dev/status/106858574990422016\"> announced their appearance <em>before</em> release </a>. It&#x2019;s clear to see why, as the bold little birds had come far in the transition. Free-range, chickens could roam the map and react to player shots/movement. Now found on the competitive Inferno, Cobblestone, Italy, Militia and Rush maps, chickens will also spawn anywhere during deathmatch, and even score 1 point when killed. In homage to 1.6&#x2019;s originals, two butchered chickens can be found <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2D423WGxiYRejJZMExzRUsxclk\"> hanging in Italy&#x2019;s market </a>. &#xA0;Take a look through the offices of the updated Nuke, and you&#x2019;ll find a message informing staff to <a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nlmteT0uq8qoRKFYpQSdwziGsNNgrLwVEm6IGGKl1dOSwKQNKp2BX61Cj3iFX3o14XL3_F4sIhtTMb4=w1920-h947\"> &#x201C;stop letting chickens in the facility.&#x201D; </a> Since release, chickens have also been included in many of the game&#x2019;s Operations, requesting the player eliminate them through a variety of means. Even CS:GO&#x2019;s bots appear to take umbrage at their smaller companions, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls6IxnBhecA\"> voicing their disgust </a><strong>.</strong> Valve has done much to accommodate the influx, patching a henhouse into Inferno&#x2019;s T-side spawn, and even allowing players to claim chickens as their own. <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/MajesticNimbleBuckeyebutterfly\"> Press E on a chicken and she&#x2019;ll follow you until death </a>, even teleporting to spawn if she survives the round. When killed, your period of ownership is reported, letting you remember the good times spent together.&#xA0; Fowl play The inclusion of livestock to the competitive world was always a risky proposition, and on more than one occasion they&#x2019;ve interfered with professional play. When first added, chickens would run away and squawk when approached. In Dreamhack Winter 2013, this led to the death of Recursive&#x2019;s star sniper kennyS, when a fleeing chicken caused his opponent to fire early. Professional AWPers are trained to react with split-second timing, and the unwitting bird triggered Skadoodle to fire right as kenny prepared to peek, killing him through the corner of a wall. When Keyd Stars faced rampageKillers in the R1SECUP, 2015, Fallen found himself a personal chicken bodyguard, casually blocking SHOOWTiME&#x2019;s sight to soften the blow. Unfortunately, rampageKillers went on to win the round, proving this bird&#x2019;s sacrifice in vain. Following a number of professional&#x2019;s complaints, Valve eventually patched chickens, reducing their responsiveness to player movement and the volume of their clucks, citing professional suggestions in the patch notes. When asked directly, however, professional opinions are mixed. While some only want to save their feathered brethren, others simple want to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWBspIfzbMk\"> <em>kill them all</em> </a><em>. </em>Despite the complaints, some chickens <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9msdHj1O4-g\"> still take that extra step for attention </a>. Popular poultry The popularity of chickens with the game&#x2019;s fanbase has inspired a plethora of entertaining fan art, in-game stickers, videos, and even mods. 1.6&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33MU_gXqmaA\"> chicken attack mod </a> transformed one side into bloodthirsty birds intent on pecking the opposition to death. Global Offensive&#x2019;s offerings gave players the chance to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoV45VHxvAM\"> race chickens </a>, or attempt to defuse <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCic_CnHLew\"> bombs strapped to them </a>. Source Filmmaker and the Saxxy awards sparked the creation of some amusing chicken clips, most notably the 2014 entrant, Defuse on the Fly (above), by Deviant Pictures Films.&#xA0; It would seem, however, that chickens don&#x2019;t want to be limited to just canon fodder. Chiken, a silver ranked player, has gained legendary status by infiltrating not only a large number of big CS:GO streamers, but even a LAN tournament semi-final. Joining the lobbies, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHz0LKRzshw\" target=\"_blank\">the infamous Chiken</a> was initially friendly, stating that he only wanted to play. However, following the inevitable kicking that followed, chiken has become more ominous, finally leaving the message: &#x201C;This is only the beginning.&#x201D; With security measures tightened up, the return of chiken at future events remains to be seen.&#xA0; The inclusion of comedic birds in an otherwise realistically-themed competitive shooter has helped highlight the fun in what can often be a very silly game. So next time you see a chicken on the battlefield, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsEoN5idc04\"> think twice before you end its life </a>. ",

We even have the CS:GO: PGL Major Krak&#xF3;w 2017 Offline Qualifier to look forward to. All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. <strong>League of Legends: NA LCS</strong> Immortals continued to dominate the competition in week four coming out on top in their match against Counter Logic Gaming with a 2-0 sweep. The first game started out with a strong early-game from Immortals, but they struggled to turn that lead into any significant objectives. This quickly changed when CLG made several poor teamfights that resulted in IMT taking objectives. CLG struggled to defend their base as structures fell all around them and they eventually fell to the mounting pressure. Dardoch started game two with some strong early ganks that gave CLG and early lead, however, CLG suffered the same problem as the first game and they constantly engaged in unwinnable team fights. Meanwhile, IMT simply punished CLG&#x2019;s over-aggression and methodically took objectives until they closed out the game. Week 5 starts today and we shall see whether anyone can contest IMT for the top spot.

The ultra-aggressive attrition approach employed by FNC has been extremely successful and ROCCAT has been the only team that has been able to punish their playstyle. However, H2K decided not to follow in ROCCAT&#x2019;s footsteps, as they chose to engage Fnatic head-on. This decision proved to be extremely detrimental and FNC&#x2019;s aggressive playstyle simply went unpunished. FNC constantly continued to ramp up the pressure throughout both games and secured a quick 2-0 victory, putting them firmly at the top of the leaderboard. FNC will be aiming to continue this success when they face Splyce today.

However, Phoenix1 managed to secure an early gold lead in game two, but they never managed to convert this into objectives. &#xA0;Eventually, Cloud9 was able to pull off a few strong engages and P1&#x2019;s lead quickly crumbled as C9 took their final win. Meanwhile, Team SoloMid managed to take down their previously undefeated rival Counter Logic Gaming, bringing TSM into fifth place, with CLG claiming top spot.

NiP showed glimpses of individual player skill and brilliance, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough to stop the reigning champions. In the first game, NiP managed to secure a lead in kills and gold, but they couldn&#x2019;t maintain this momentum and after 30 minutes G2 began tightening the noose. It was clear that G2&#x2019;s experience and teamplay was on another level and NiP eventually crumbled. The second game was all about Zven who secured 14 out of 20 total kills with his dominant Twitch plays. Meanwhile, Misfits will be aiming to build upon their week two victories when they take on G2 in today&#x2019;s matchup.

Cloud9 will be aiming to put their spring playoffs loss behind them after Team SoloMid took the trophy.

G2&#x2019;s MSI journey painted a picture of confidence, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough to stop SKT from blowing open their Nexus in the final. However, the defending EU LCS champions will face ROCCAT in first game of the summer split. G2 did lose to ROCCAT at the end of the last regular split, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough to stop G2 from claiming the title.

Na&apos;Vi will also join the group, alongside the Chinese Regional Winners LGD Forever Young.

KD Panthera lost their opening match against Lunatic-Hai, but the team has not let this defeat impact their overall dominance in the arena. However, Lunatic-Hai has yet to lose a single match, so KD Panthera will need to be at their best if they&#x2019;re to dismantle the current leaders. The Group A match begins today at 03:00 PDT / 12:00 CEST, while the Group B match between MVP.S and CB Spirit starts at 04:30 PDT / 13:30 CEST.

The Canadian roster of CorruptedG, Lethamyr, and Sadjunior have been on top form and in week five they &#xA0;dispatched Rogue Esports &#xA0;to claim their regional championship spot. However, Alpha Sydney has dominated the Oceanic Region with their strong defensive plays and accurate cross-map goals. Drippay, Jake, and Torsos pose a threat to Denial&#x2019;s claim to the RLCS throne, so they will need to remain focussed if they wish to advance.

These events will feature &quot;twists on the classic game rules&quot;, and will play out on new maps across both casual and competitive. These events will mostly involve the aforementioned &quot;twists&quot;. For example, Wingman, is a 2v2 best-of-16 format, while Weapons Expert is a 5v5 best-of-30 match where the player can only purchase a weapon once. Other varieties come in the form of War Games, which includes Heavy Assault Suit &#x2013; a bomb defusal round with the added twist that one player is wearing heavy armor.&#xA0; Meanwhile, Headshots Only is a War Game which does what it says on the tin; Hunters-Gatherers is a mode where each player drops a dogtag on death, which can be collected to win the game, and Stab Stab Zap involves only a knife, a recharging Zeus and grenades. There are more War Games, detailed <a href=\"http://www.counter-strike.net/operationhydra/#upgrade\">over here</a>. Of course, you can buy an &quot;all access&quot; pass for $5.99 (US), which boosts the XP you earn, while also adding a new Guardian campaign where you and a friend play through a series of missions where, at a hunch, enemies will need to be shot. There are also the usual range of new weapon skins, cases and more. The full rundown can be read <a href=\"http://www.counter-strike.net/operationhydra/#upgrade\">over here</a>. ",

        "contents": "Photo credit: ESL The Dota 2 Kiev Major wrapped up last weekend with OG defeating Virtus.pro 3-2 to take home their fourth Major crown and the $1 million prize pool. However, there&#x2019;s still plenty of action to come from the League of Legends Mid-Season Invitational to the CS:GO Intel Extreme Masters. We even have the Hearthstone China vs. Europe tournament to look forward to. All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. <strong>League of Legends: Mid-Season Invitational</strong> The Mid-Season Invitational kicked off with eight teams battling for the chance to advance to the main event in Rio de Janeiro. GIGABYTE Marines will play this Saturday against the loser of the round two series between Flash Wolves and Supermassive. Meanwhile, the winner of Saturday&#x2019;s match will advance to the MSI Group Stage, so both teams will need to be at their best. GIGABYTE surprised many fans this week when they managed to take two wins away from TSM, but they failed to take the series. Jungler Levi will be aiming to use his creative pathing once again this weekend, so expect plenty of jungle antics in round three of the Play-In stage. The full schedule and stream can be found on <a href=\"https://eu.lolesports.com/en/schedule\"> LoL Esports </a>. <strong>Rocket League: RLCS Regional Championships</strong> The Rocket League RLCS Championships return this weekend and players will be fighting for their share of $25,000 prize pool and a spot in the Season 3 World Championship. The top two teams from NA and EU will also get guaranteed spots next season, which puts even more pressure on the teams this weekend. The action kicks off in North America this Saturday at 12:00 PDT / 21:00 CEST, while Europe closes out the weekend this Sunday at 09:00 PDT / 18:00 CEST. Tune into all the latest action over on<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/rocketleague\"> Twitch </a> to find out which team will punch their ticket to Los Angeles. <strong>CS:GO: Intel Extreme Masters XII&#x2014;Sydney</strong> Day one of Intel Extreme Masters Sydney 2017 concluded with SK Gaming and Astralis taking the lead. SK Gaming lived up to expectations as they quickly dismantled ViCi by consistently outgunning them. ViCi struggled to produce a positive result against the competition favourites and SK closed out the series 16:6. Meanwhile, Astralis notched a victory over IEM&#x2019;s local representatives, Chiefs Esports. Chiefs did find some success in securing bomb plants, but this was fairly short-lived, as Astralis started winning consecutive rounds. Astralis were on top form and they crushed the Chiefs in a dominant 16:5 victory. This weekend&#x2019;s full schedule and stream can be found by heading over to<a href=\"http://en.intelextrememasters.com/sydney/schedule/\"> IEM&#x2019;s official site </a>. <strong>Overwatch: Apex Season 3</strong> The Overwatch Apex Season 3 kicked off in Korea last week and Lunatic Hai are currently in the lead in the Group A bracket after they beat Team KongDoo Panthera 3-2. Rogue will need to land a critical blow to Mighty AOD if they wish to rival Lunatic Hai for first place. Team KongDoo Uncia will face X-6 Gaming at 03:00 PDT / 12:00 CEST, while Rogue will clash with Mighty AOD at 04:30 PDT / 13:30 CEST. Meanwhile, EnVyUs will start their journey on May 16th where they will battle it out against the likes of Meta Athena and BK Stars. Make sure to check out the full stream over on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ognglobal\"> Twitch </a>. <strong>Hearthstone: Global Games</strong> The Hearthstone Global Games tournament is well underway, and a few teams have begun to establish themselves in the early stages of the tournament. Group C&#x2019;s round three matches concluded yesterday for US viewers, &#xA0;but those of you in Europe can catch all the action today at 03:00 CEST. The USA are off to the best start out of anyone in the Global Games so far&#x2014;securing seven wins in total and only dropping one game. It&#x2019;s a long road ahead for the pros and every team will be fighting hard to secure the $300,000 prize pool. The full schedule and stream for week four can <a href=\"http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/esports/schedule/\"> be found here </a>. <strong>Hearthstone: China vs. Europe</strong> The fourth Hearthstone vs. China tournament began its group stage yesterday and will continue until May 10th. Europe was undefeated for three years straight before China retorted with a championship win last year. Bohan &#x201C;Lovelychook&#x201D; Zhang dethroned former champion Aleksandr &#x201C;Kolento&#x201D; Malsh and drove home his Ferrari sports car prize. This year&#x2019;s CN vs. EU has made the Ferrari winnable by all, so every player will need to be at their best if they wish to drive home in style. A mix of invites and tournament winners will represent the host nation, most notably Blizzcon semi-finalist Jason &#x201C;JazonZhou&#x201D; Zhou and reigning champion Lovelychook. Group play resumes today at 03:00 PDT / 15:00 CEST, so make sure you check out the stream over on<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/firebat\"> Twitch </a>. <strong>Heroes of the Storm: Global Championship</strong> The Heroes of the Storm Global Championship begins week ten of play this weekend and the top teams from EU and NA aim to continue their dominance. Gale Force will need to secure a decisive win over Tempo Storm and B-Step this weekend if they want to make a claim for top spot. Meanwhile, Dignitas will be looking to snag a win over Fnatic after being knocked down to second place.

        "contents": "French professional team Vexed <a href=\"http://www.vexedmultigaming.com/team-vexed/kqly-joins-vexed-for-esl-championnat-national-2017/\"> announced in a blog post </a> this morning that they were hiring Hovik &quot;KQLY&quot; Tovmassian, a one-time staple of <em>CS:GO&#x2019;s </em>upper echelons of professional competition. In his heyday, KQLY played for some of the game&#x2019;s best teams, winning a couple sizeable tournaments and placing well in some massive events as part of French teams LDLC and Titan. One problem: KQLY was banned for cheating back in 2014, prohibiting him from participating in official Valve-sponsored tournaments, the highest tier of competition in CS:GO. Due to <a href=\"https://compete.kotaku.com/counter-strike-tournament-organizer-changes-rules-for-b-1793576857\"> recent rule changes </a> made by ESL, one of CS:GO&#x2019;s biggest tournament organizers, Vexed will be able to participate in some decent-sized tournaments with KQLY in their roster, but the game&#x2019;s players and spectators have reacted negatively to the announcement. Two of Vexed s existing players stated that they had not been informed of the potential roster change before it happened. KQLY is likely the highest-profile player to ever receive a ban for cheating in CS:GO. At the height of his success, shortly after finishing in the top four at ESL One: Cologne as part of Titan, his team seemed poised for greatness in the latter half of 2014. But his squadmates&#x2019; hopes were crushed that November when KQLY was banned, and Valve announced that the whole Titan team would not be allowed to compete at Dreamhack Winter 2014. Eventually, KQLY was replaced and Titan carried on, but they were never able to achieve the success that had seemed inevitable before the ban, and eventually dissolved in 2016. In <a href=\"http://titan.pro/news/read/Titan-Bids-Farewell/58\"> a farewell letter from the CEO </a>, Titan alluded to KQLY&#x2019;s misconduct as a large part of their inability to keep the team operational. <a href=\"http://fragbite.se/\"> KQLY, as a member of Titan. (image via Fragbite.se) </a> The controversy damaged CS:GO&#x2019;s reputation as an esport and made KQLY an unpopular figure, so Vexed&#x2019;s hiring of KQLY to play for them in the upcoming ESL Championnat National tournament was bound to be poorly received by the community. But surprisingly, that negative reception extended to the team itself: <a href=\"https://flickshot.fr/flash/jarod-and-smyli-refuse-to-play-for-vexed-after-the-arrival-of-kqly/472?lang=en\"> two of Vexed&#x2019;s existing players stated </a> that they had not been informed of the potential roster change before it happened, and that they refused to play with KQLY in upcoming events. Vexed has now updated their roster at the bottom of the original announcement, removing all mention of the two dissenting players. Other CS:GO professionals weighed in on the announcement as well. Veteran player and current LDLC member Ex6TenZ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LDLC_Ex6TenZ/status/859095774034055170\"> tweeted a sarcastic one-liner </a> that implied Vexed would have a much harder time finding sponsors for their team now that they had a former cheater in their employ. Former Team Liquid player Hiko expressed similar derision on <a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/LovelyOilyMulePMSTwin\"> his Twitch stream </a> upon hearing the news, exclaiming &#x201C;KQLY&#x2019;s back on a team again - gets VAC banned, but can join a team? Interesting. My boy throws a match and he&#x2019;s banned for life, but KQLY literally cheats in the game and comes back?&#x201D; In the latter half of his remarks, Hiko alludes to an old wound that the CS:GO community has been nursing for years now; he mentions that while the recent ESL rule changes allow anyone banned for cheating to play in ESL tournaments once two years have passed, the iBuyPower players who were <a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/North_American_match_fixing_scandal\"> banned for match fixing </a> in early 2015 are still banned indefinitely. Much of the community believes cheating in the actual game to be as heinous of a crime as throwing a match for financial compensation, and that Valve&#x2019;s failure to address this disparity in punishment has festered for an inordinately long time. Vexed still won&#x2019;t be able to play in the Valve-sponsored &#x201C;Majors,&#x201D; CS:GO&#x2019;s most lucrative tournaments, since Valve maintains that no cheater will ever be allowed back into its good graces. In reality, that doesn&#x2019;t affect a team like Vexed much; they&#x2019;re not at the level where they would qualify for Majors, and since ESL has changed its rules, Vexed can still play all of the tournaments that exist at their skill level without incident. This stands in contrast to the fate of iBuyPower&#x2019;s players, who are still banned by Valve, ESL, and any other tournament organizer who wishes to maintain their relationship with Valve. It&#x2019;s a sticky situation that once again has players questioning Valve&#x2019;s philosophy regarding banned players, and has the potential to deal another blow to CS:GO&#x2019;s reputation with sponsors and organizing bodies.

        "contents": "Last week didn&apos;t get off to a great start for Adam &apos;LoOp&apos; Bahriz. The 17-year-old Counter-Strike player hopped onto the competitive Global Offensive <a href=\"https://play.esea.net/\"> ESEA league </a> to play a few rounds while broadcasting to a tiny audience <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/lo0p__\"> on Twitch </a> only to be bullied and kicked from the match shortly after. Then, after Bahriz&apos;s story got shared on Reddit, the community banded together to donate thousands of dollars to pay for medical procedures and college while also <a href=\"https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/lo0p__/monthly\"> boosting his follower count </a> from under 5,000 to nearly 100,000. He&apos;s even been offered contracts with Twitch and some of CS:GO&apos;s biggest esports teams. &quot;I&apos;m still absolutely mesmerized this is incredible,&quot; Bahriz wrote on Reddit. It&apos;s one of the most dramatic stories of how internet communities can often be toxic one second and heart-warmingly generous the next. And it all started because of a simple misunderstanding due to Bahriz&apos;s disability. Bahriz was born with a condition that has left him legally blind, deaf, and unable to feel pain. It&apos;s known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2, or simply HSAN 2. Despite his disability, he is still an incredible CS player and currently sits at Rank B on ESEA&#x2014;a pretty damn good spot to hold for even able-bodied players. But his condition also led to needing his teeth and part of his nose removed. Understandably, this makes verbal communication a little trickier for him. That&apos;s why he graciously explained his condition at the beginning of the ESEA match. &quot;Sup guys I got a lot of teeth removed due to a genetic disease so I can&apos;t speak that properly, I can still call but be nice,&quot; Bahriz wrote in text chat at the beginning of the round. Bahriz then began using the voice channel to talk strategy with his team, but they didn&apos;t take him seriously.&#xA0; &quot;Dude, we know you&apos;re trolling. Just stop,&quot; one player said back while the rest of the team trash talked Bahriz&apos;s speech impediment and began muting him. A few rounds later, they voted to kick him from the game entirely. Understandably, Bahriz was upset. His team was up 5-1 and Bahriz was trying to recover from a losing streak from previous games. &quot;At that point all I could think about was all the bullshit I&#x2019;ve had to deal with on ESEA for the longest time, not because of a completely lacking of ability to talk, or mechanical skill, or anything like that, but just because of a small speech problem that is caused by something I have no control over,&quot; Bahriz <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/disabled-streamer-receives-hundreds-in-donations-after-1794507360\"> told Kotaku </a>. At that point all I could think about was all the bullshit I ve had to deal with on ESEA for the longest time... just because of a small speech problem that is caused by something I have no control over. The whole incident, including Bahriz&apos;s frustration following being kicked, was broadcast to his handful of viewers. One of them decided to take action. &quot;This honestly broke my heart man,&quot; a user by the name of ch0med <a href=\"https://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=931040&amp;find_comment_number=49\"> wrote on the ESEA forums </a>, linking to Twitch clips of Bahriz being muted and kicked from the game. &quot;This is absolutely disgusting how some people can be towards others without even getting a glimpse of some of the struggles people face. And they turn to gaming to get away from the real world, but still people just feel the need to ruin other people.&quot;&#xA0; Meanwhile, another viewer <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/65uma8/guy_with_hsan_legally_blinddeaf_bullied_off_esea/\"> posted to the CS:GO subreddit </a>, asking the community to &quot;show him some love&quot; because of what happened. And boy, did they. Both posts immediately exploded, with the Reddit thread becoming the most popular on the subreddit within hours. Meanwhile, Twitch shared an incredible clip of Bahriz securing a clutch win for his team alone against five enemies. Because of this, Bahriz&apos;s popularity immediately exploded and by the end of the day his Twitch stream had upwards of 5,000 active viewers.&#xA0; Things get even better. With HSAN 2, Bahriz understandably requires a lot of medical care. As he told Kotaku, he needed eye surgery that his insurance wouldn&apos;t be able to cover. But thanks to an outpouring of donations that day, he&apos;s able to get the operation done and pay for it out of pocket. What&apos;s more, in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/66cort/hey_guys_im_loop_17_yo_partially_blinddeaf_csgo/\"> Ask Me Anything thread </a> he created on the CS:GO subreddit, Bahriz explains he&apos;ll likely be able to pay for college and a trip home to Algeria. Shortly after Bahriz&apos;s story exploded, two of his teammates came out on the ESEA forums to explain their side of the story and apologize. &quot;We thought he was a troll&#x2026;&quot; wrote Adviko. &quot;What would you think if someone came in with a bind text like that, people troll like that all the time. Instead he should tell the people to check out his Twitch. After I checked his Twitch I realized he was for real. I apologize but it was an honest misunderstanding. Lots of people troll in ESEA.&quot; While their position is somewhat understandable, people didn&apos;t have too much sympathy considering how quick they were to judge Bahriz, even after he apologized and said he wouldn&apos;t talk. According to Bahriz, each teammate received a three day ban from the third-party league. The community outreach around Bahriz since the initial flurry of attention has been heartwarming. Team EnVyUs, one of the largest esports teams who most recently took home $800,000 in the World Electronic Sports Games 2016, reached out to offer Bahriz a streaming contract. Bahriz has also since signed a Twitch partner contract.&#xA0; Bahriz now has over 97,000 followers on Twitch after everything that has happened, and his audience continues to grow. While he is stunned by the community&apos;s response, he also hints that things might&apos;ve been taken out of proportion. &quot;I couldn&apos;t give a single fuck that I randomly got kicked, 20 of not pugging is no big deal,&quot; he wrote. &quot; other situations I would&apos;ve probably not muted them and linked my Twitch but I was just tired of that shit at that point.&quot; Still, it&apos;s a good reminder to always be mindful that people we meet online might have their own struggles we&apos;re not aware of.&#xA0; ",

All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 EU LCS Spring Split Finals</strong> Two-time defending EU LCS champions G2 Esports secured three straight wins against Fnatic in the semifinals last Saturday, winning the series and taking a spot in this weekend&#x2019;s finals. Fnatic didn&#x2019;t go down without a fight and they caught G2 off-guard in game one with aggressive roaming and early lane swaps, but G2 played safe and punished Fnatic&#x2019;s over-aggressive plays. Meanwhile, Unicorns of Love took down Misfits in a tense 3-1 series. The final game saw UOL secure an early lead thanks to an explosive play in the bot lane, which gave them a 3-1 lead. UOL used this power advantage to quickly barrage Misfits&#x2019; bot-lane and secure a quick 23-minute victory.

Both teams will play in Vancouver this Saturday and TSM will face Cloud9, while FlyQuest will play in the third place match against Phoenix1 in the finals. The series saw both teams pick strong team fighting compositions, but TSM had a better frontline which they used to tank FlyQuest&#x2019;s damage and snag objectives for a decisive sweep. The semifinal series for Cloud9 was also a one-sided affair as they dominated Phoenix1 in a quick 3-0 series. Cloud9 matched P1 point for point, but they always had the advantage in every skirmish. Phoenix1 desperately tried to make a comeback, but Cloud9&#x2019;s superiority was shown in game three when they only gave up one tower and three kills.

According to the industry researchers at <a href=\"https://www.superdataresearch.com/market-data/gaming-video-content/\" target=\"_blank\">SuperData</a>, the &quot;worldwide gaming video content audience&quot; includes 665 million people. And it&apos;s growing: The company predicts a 21 percent viewer increase between now and 2021. According to SuperData, there&apos;s now a bigger audience for gaming video than the combined audiences of HBO, Netflix, ESPN, and Hulu. For reference, Netflix&apos;s subscriber count is <a href=\"https://qz.com/888801/netflix-shares-are-rising-on-strong-fourth-quarter-2016-subscriber-growth-nflx/\" target=\"_blank\">somewhere near 100 million</a>, while Hulu <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/press/about\" target=\"_blank\">maintains about 12 million</a>. For better or for worse, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie\" target=\"_blank\">PewDiePie</a> alone has over 54 million YouTube subscribers.&#xA0; It&apos;s not a shocking conclusion: Netflix, for instance, is <a href=\"https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-is-now-available-around-the-world\" target=\"_blank\">not currently available in China</a>, so it&apos;s no wonder that it would be dwarfed by a category of typically free, streaming video around the world. But if there was still any doubt that the YouTubes and Twitches of the world have made gaming video as mainstream as any primetime TV show, it ought to have vanished long ago. The report also concludes that men make up 54 percent of the audience for gaming streams and videos and women account for 46 percent. Additionally, gamers who watch streams and videos have a higher average income than other gamers, and like to spend it. &quot;PC and console players who watch spend over $70 a month on digital games and in-game content, 56 percent more than their non-viewer counterparts,&quot; reads SuperData&apos;s press release. We watched &quot;nearly 100 million hours&quot; of League of Legends in February alone, according to the report, with CS:GO coming in second at 40 million hours on Twitch. Twitch is one of the biggest earners in the scene, despite not holding the majority of the eyeballs. SuperData finds that it only captures 16 percent of the audience, but earns 37 percent of &apos;gaming video content&apos;s&apos; revenue thanks in large part to direct spending through subscriptions. And through advertising and direct spending (subscriptions and donations), SuperData predicts $4.6 billion in revenue from gaming video and streams this year. That probably has something to do with why over half the audience for livestreams wants to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-stream-on-twitch/\">try livestreaming themselves</a>. <a href=\"https://www.superdataresearch.com/market-data/gaming-video-content/\" target=\"_blank\">SuperData&apos;s full report</a> will set interested companies back $2,499. Surely there are some interesting insights inside, but here&apos;s the too expensive, didn&apos;t read version: a lot of people like to watch videogames on the computer. ",

There&#x2019;s plenty of action from the Dota 2 StarLadder i-League Invitational to the CS:GO Championship Series. We even have the Overwatch: PIT Championship to look forward to. All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 EU LCS Spring Split</strong> Last weekend&#x2019;s quarterfinals of the European League of Legends LCS saw H2K face off against Fnatic. Fnatic shocked viewers around the world when they dominated H2K with their unconventional champion picks. Rekkles&#x2019; Twitch was unstoppable and after securing Baron and Elder Dragon buffs, Fnatic stormed into H2K&#x2019;s base to deliver the final blow to the Nexus. Game two followed a similar pattern as Rekkles found strength in another unorthodox pick. His Vayne plays gave Fnatic a huge power spike in the late-game and they delivered another crushing blow to H2K. In match point for Fnatic, it was Caps&apos; turn to shine and he locked-in Aurelion Sol in the mid-lane. Meanwhile, Rekkles&#x2019; Kennen and Broxah&#x2019;s Kha&apos;Zix roamed around the map eliminating any signs of life from the H2K roster. Fnatic overcame expectations and they&#x2019;ll be hoping to deliver another decisive win over G2 Esports in the semifinals.

The first game of the series saw CLG mid-laner Huhi lock in Aurelion Sol, which he used to pick off FLY&#x2019;s support multiple times. His global presence was huge, and CLG were able to grab Baron and quickly push into FLY&apos;s base for the first win of the series. Game 2 was a back-and-forth affair with both teams struggling to secure a lead. However, a team fight around Baron pit broke out and CLG managed to take down four members of FlyQuest. This successful engage gave CLG plenty of time to dismantle turrets and apply pressure around the map. Game three saw FlyQuest obliterate CLG with Hai&#x2019;s dominating performance on Talon, while game four also went in favour of FLY thanks to Moon&#x2019;s excellent Rengar plays. However, FLY took the final game by punishing CLG&#x2019;s over-aggressive skirmishes and baiting out an Elder Dragon fight.

LGD.Forever bounced back in game two with a strong defensive strategy that saw only their outer towers fall. However, iG.Vitality showed their superiority in game three by winning every team fight and killing Roshan multiple times. Meanwhile, CDEC Gaming had a great time against Wings Gaming and they swept them in a clean 2-0 victory. CDEC Gaming was forced to play defensively in the first game, but they took the advantage in the second with constant ganks. Wings Gaming eventually collapsed under the pressure and CDEC closed out the final game in just 26- minutes.

        "contents": "Most players like theirs small, while others prefer a bulky frame. Some choose to rely only a single dot. Whatever your preference, your crosshair is an important tool, and it&apos;s worth investing time to find the right one. The key is to experiment and see what works for you. Collected below are the simplest steps to customising your own sights for CS:GO. Ditch the default If you&#x2019;re still using the default crosshair, change it. Introduced to the series in CS:GO, the default dynamic crosshair changes size based on movement, stance and shooting. While the idea is nice in principle&#x2014;teaching new players that movement hampers accuracy&#x2014;the result is a cluttered, confusing mess. Taking up a hefty portion of the screen, the default dynamic is overly animated. Wildly expanding and shrinking as you play, it serves more as a distraction than a representation of where your bullets will go. The expansion of the crosshair can even mislead you into believing your shots will land within that area. The best way to customize your crosshair Beyond the default, CS:GO crosshairs come in four main styles: Default Static, Classic, Classic Dynamic and Classic Static. These are all accessible from the in-game menu, but beneath this, CS:GO hides a treasure trove of customization options. To fully customize your reticle, you&#x2019;ll want to edit the game&#x2019;s autoexec.cfg file. This informs CS:GO of any settings you want it to adopt on startup, and can be found in the game&#x2019;s directory (Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg). Open this up in a notepad and you can edit to your heart&#x2019;s content, provided you know the right commands. Searching for these and testing each change can prove time-consuming, but fortunately the CS:GO community has already risen to the challenge, simplifying the process. Workshop user Crashz has produced <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308490450\"> an extremely generous map </a>, allowing every aspect of the crosshair to be easily adjusted on the fly. From the line thickness to the alpha, it&#x2019;s all managed through a simple button interface. First, try swapping between the basic styles of crosshair to find one you like the feel of before you really crack on with tweaking. The main aspects to play with are thickness, gap, color and dot. While much is left to preference, there are some general rules of thumb to follow: * When considering the crosshair gap (the distance from line to line in the vertical or horizontal), smaller distances are usually best. The larger the void between each side, the harder it is to judge the precise center of the screen. * The bigger it is, the more your screen will be obscured. If you tend to fight at long range and one-tap with rifles, a meaty reticle might not line up with your technique. * When selecting a color, consider your environments. A light yellow will be hard to spot against Dust2&#x2019;s sandy walls. Similarly, a blue or purple crosshair might be less prominent in darker locations. Aim for something light but clear. * Have your heart set on a dynamic crosshair? Consider having a central dot too. As the crosshair expands it can help to have a stationary point to focus on. If you&#x2019;re not feeling creative, you can always copy the pros. Coating the walls of the level are crosshair designs matching a huge number of professional players, and even top YouTubers and streamers. Once you&#x2019;re satisfied, Crashz&#x2019;s map allows you to copy the exact configuration details by hitting the &#x201C;share crosshair&#x201D; button. Beyond letting you compare with a friend, this is a great way to backup crosshairs that you like. Simply save the text in a notepad file and you&#x2019;ll be able to copy the text directly into your autoexec or console to retrieve it. This is an essential step on the off chance you have to reinstall the game. Online alternatives There&#x2019;s no substitute to testing your crosshair in action, but if you don&#x2019;t have time to load up the game, Skarbo&apos;s <a href=\"http://tools.dathost.net/#alpha=200/color=5/color_b=50/color_r=50/color_g=250/dot=0/gap=0/size=5/style=4/usealpha=1/thickness=0.5/outline=0/outline_draw=0\"> CS:GO crosshair generator </a> is a good alternative. Each trait can be adjusted via sliding bars, altering the display on the left. Offering a few advantages over Crashz&#x2019;s map, manually adjust the RGB color values allows fine control over color.&#xA0; While it hasn&#x2019;t been updated in awhile, a selection of classic map locations can be viewed, with targets at a variety of ranges to test your sights. Once again, copy the details in the config box and paste them into your autoexec.cfg to load them next time you play. You could even make something like this. (Please don t.) Try before you buy Before you jump straight into to matchmaking, a few rounds of deathmatch will give ample time to acclimate to your new sights. More importantly, this should highlight any remaining niggles. Try playing with a thinner frame than you&#x2019;re used to, complete a round using just a central dot. If you&#x2019;re missing the shots you used to, don&#x2019;t sweat it. A change in sights is expected to throw you off a bit, but with a little practice, you&#x2019;ll be landing cleaner headshots in no time at all. ",

The developer beefed up the underused R8 revolver, but the more drastic changes were made to the Negev, the expensive, hefty, wild machine gun that players only previously used as a joke. The first time you use the new-look Negev, or the Newgev , as the kids are calling it, it feels broken. You ll move at a snail s pace when carrying it, and the first 16 bullets of your magazine come out at random angles, making it impossible to control. Even the first bullet is wayward, so tap firing is completely out your only hope is to squeeze the trigger and pray. The gamechanger is what happens after that first burst. Your aim levels out and the gun becomes laser accurate at short or medium range, the spray grouping tightly just above your crossbar with no horizontal movement. As long as you re standing still you can snap from target to target with pinpoint accuracy. &#8230; ",

As the <a href=\"http://valvestore.welovefine.com/csgo-collectible-five-year-veteran-coin-faq\">FAQ</a> explains, if you haven&apos;t earned the coin in the game, then you&apos;re not allowed to buy this physical rendition. And yes, they check: In order to preorder, you have to log in with your Steam account, and if there&apos;s no coin in your inventory, you&apos;re out of luck.&#xA0; If it&apos;s simply a matter of timing&#x2014;say, you&apos;re a four-year CS:GO vet&#x2014;then &quot;stay tuned,&quot; because the FAQ notes that &quot;more purchasing opportunities&quot; will be coming in the future. If your account is straight-up ineligible for some other reason, however, that&apos;s the end of it. &quot;We have no way of allowing ineligible users to purchase the Coin, nor can we bypass any VAC bans or ownership checks to allow users to purchase,&quot; it says. For those who are eligible, purchases are limited to one, and only one, per account.&#xA0; The coin, made from die cast zinc alloy with the &quot;5&quot; up front in copper, is 63mm in diameter and 3mm thick, and weighs just a hair under 56 grams. It arrives in a box with an acrylic cover that can be hung on a wall, and also includes an acrylic coin stand if a shelf display is more to your tastes. Worldwide shipping is included in the price, except to Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Burma, Syria and Sudan, although you may have to cover VAT or other region-specific taxes.&#xA0; There&apos;s no two ways about it: 45 bucks for a little commemorative trinket isn&apos;t cheap. But my instinct to be critical is tempered by the Max Payne statuette that&apos;s glaring at me from the shelf on the other side of the room.

There&#x2019;s plenty of action from the Overwatch APEX finals to the CS:GO StarLadder i-League StarSeries. We even have the crazed combo action of the Street Fighter V Ultimate Fighting Arena to look forward to. All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 EU LCS Spring Split</strong> Roccat managed to break G2&#x2019;s year-long streak after picking up game two and three, while Fnatic secured their playoff spot by beating Misfits in a 2-1 victory. Meanwhile, H2k were still looking to grab first place in the group B bracket. Their first series against Origen looked a bit shaky, but xPeke&#x2019;s team failed to close the game out giving H2K the win. H2K faced Splyce&#x2019;s off-meta champions in their next matchup and they schooled Splyce on why you shouldn&#x2019;t pick Teemo in the pro scene. Vitality&#x2019;s games against Unicorns of Love followed a similar pattern as they also fielded non-meta champions, but just like Splyce they couldn&#x2019;t pull it together. This weekend&#x2019;s quarterfinal schedule and stream can be found over on <a href=\"http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/eu-lcs/eu_2017_spring/schedule/default\"> LoL Esports </a>. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 NA LCS Spring Split</strong> The NA LCS returns this weekend with the live quarterfinals where Phoenix1 will take on Team Dignitas, followed by a match between Counter Logic Gaming and FlyQuest. Week 9 was a close affair between Cloud9 and Dignitas, but a clutch teamfight and decisive plays from Jensen&#x2019;s Orianna gave C9 the power they needed to obliterate their foes. Phoenix1 also suffered at the hands of C9, while Team Liquid tried to avoid relegation by picking up two victories against TSM and FlyQuest. Team Liquid managed to beat TSM after DoubleLift&#x2019;s Ezreal obliterated TSM&#x2019;s bot-lane and he carried his team to victory. However, FlyQuest&#x2019;s Hai managed to stop them dead in their tracks with his Talon plays, and he secured a playoffs spot for FlyQuest.

Lunatic-Hai eradicated any signs of life, and they continuously punished Athena&#x2019;s over-aggressive plays with game-changing payload pushes. Lunatic-Hai will now face RunAway in the APEX finals for a chance to be crowned king and take home a lion&#x2019;s share of the $200,370 prize pool.

However, only three players can take home the cash prize, so expect competition to be extremely fierce.

However, this weekend the main competition is taking a brief break and throwing some added mayhem into the mix.

All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 EU LCS Spring Split</strong> Two of Europe&#x2019;s best teams clashed in Week eight and Misfits desperately tried to put their H2K loss behind them. Game one started off slow, but a chaotic team fight broke out when Misfits went for Baron. G2 read the situation and Expect used Teleport to counter, while the rest of his team chased their retreating opponents. G2&#x2019;s Zven breezed through Misfits and secured a quadra kill with Caitlyn, which allowed his team to break open the Nexus for the win. Game two fell to Misfits after a decisive mid-lane team fight, but G2 picked Misfits apart in the final game with clean dives and well-timed rotations. G2 remain undefeated as we head into week nine and it looks like Misfits have some catching up to do if they wish to rival them.

LOD went huge on Varus and he gave Dignitas the power they needed to secure a decisive victory in the third game. Meanwhile, Phoenix1 also managed to destroy Team Liquid after Ryu constantly punished Piglet&#x2019;s aggressive plays in the mid-lane. Ryu used his advantage to roam and snowball other lanes until Team Liquid crumbled under the pressure. However, TSM still remain the team to beat with 14 wins, and we shall see if Phoenix1 have what it takes to topple the LCS leaders.

So far G2 Esports look to be the team to beat as they had dominated Atelier before moving on to sweep Denial. If G2 can consistently maintain the level of play they showed against Denial they will definitely be on their way to earning top spot in the North American series. Meanwhile, European team The Leftovers took down both Flipsid3 and Northern Gaming 3-2, which has given them an extremely strong start to this year&#x2019;s tournament.

Obey Alliance will be hoping to remain on top as they shot into first place after securing victories over Valance Squad and Team Dignitas. However, Obey Alliance are only two points ahead, so they will have to be extremely careful if they wish to increase their lead over the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, Team Eager are the current leaders in North America, and they&#x2019;ll be tackling Luminosity who are currently in second place. Luminosity will be looking to land a critical blow to their rivals and steal first place from under them, so expect to see both teams going all out in this matchup.

Technical difficulties came up during the Team Vitality vs Giants series and game two had to be replayed due to an Orianna bug. This break unhinged the Giants and Vitality took the victory despite losing a game. Meanwhile, the top teams also had to play each other this week, and H2k remained on top form in their game against Misfits, and Unicorns of Love managed to dominate Fnatic after a game-changing team fight in game two. G2 Esports are still the team to beat and we&#x2019;ll see if anyone has what it takes to topple them as we enter week eight of play. This week&#x2019;s schedule and stream can be found over on <a href=\"http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/eu-lcs/eu_2017_spring/schedule/default\"> LoL Esports </a>. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 NA LCS Spring Split</strong> Phoenix1 had another great week and they decimated FlyQuest in both games, and now they&#x2019;re only two wins away from rivalling Cloud9 for second place. Echo Fox&#x2019;s series against Team Dignitas was very close, but in the final game jungler Chaser and mid-laner Keane managed to take complete control of the map and applied pressure until Echo Fox crumbled. Team Liquid made changes to their roster once again, but despite adding Doublelift to their line-up they couldn&#x2019;t quite takedown Cloud9. However, they did manage to win an extremely close game against Envy after a securing Baron. Meanwhile, TSM had a very shaky week which saw them drop two games against both Envy and Immortals, but they did eventually pull through and win both matches. The competition continues to heat up as we enter week eight of play and all teams will be looking to climb the competitive ladder. The full schedule and stream can be found over on <a href=\"http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/na-lcs/na_2017_spring/schedule/default\"> LoL Esports </a>. <strong>CS:GO: StarLadder i-League Season 3</strong> The American and European playoffs are taking place this weekend and only the top two teams from each bracket will secure a place in the LAN finals. G2 Esports and Space Soldiers are kicking things off in Europe today at 08:00 PDT / 16:00 CET, while Cloud9 and Renegades clash in America much later at 18:00 PDT / 02:00 CET. With $300,000 up for grabs you can bet that every team will go in guns blazing, and there&#x2019;s sure to be plenty of high-octane action. The schedule and stream for both playoffs <a href=\"https://starladder.com/en/csgostarseries-s3/matches\"> can be found here </a>. <strong>Rocket League: Championship Series</strong> The 16 teams that will be competing in the Rocket League Championship Series over the next six weeks have been decided. There was a big upset in Europe as PENTA Sports will once again miss out on league play after falling 1-3 to RedEye and losing to Mockit eSports in the loser&#x2019;s bracket. Another surprise was delivered by ZentoX who fought their way through the lower bracket to claim the last available spot in league play. Meanwhile, in North America Radiance managed to take down both Iris and Atelier for the first spot, but the biggest surprise came when Iris was knocked out by Selfless. Make sure you check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rlcs?lang=en\"> RLCS official Twitter handle </a> to receive the latest schedule times and streams. <strong>Hearthstone: Trinity Series</strong> The top four teams from the online portion of the Trinity Series will be participating in the live finals this Saturday. There&#x2019;s a $150,000 prize pool up for grabs, and the tournament will be hosted at ESL Studios in Burbank, California. So far Team Liquid is the favourite team to secure a place at the final, but the competition is looking extremely close and every player will need to be at the top of their game if they want to take home the title. The upper bracket finals and lower bracket semifinal starts today at 10:00 PDT / 18:00 CET, while the lower bracket finals and grand finals start the same time tomorrow. The official stream can be found over on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/esl_hearthstone\"> Twitch </a>. <strong>Heroes of the Storm: Eastern Clash</strong> The top Heroes of the Storm teams from China, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan will clash in order to crown the best team in Asia. Matches will be played in a double-elimination format and there&#x2019;s expected to be rivalries between China and Korea, especially between organisations like MVP Black and eStar Gaming. With $100,000 on the line and a chance to claim bragging rights over Asia the Eastern Clash is expected to deliver an action-packed weekend.

They starved UoL of objectives and gold in the first game, while the second game was won thanks to a game-changing quadra kill from Zven. Splyce has improved tremendously and Kobbe&#x2019;s Jhin was the star of the show going 8/1/9 against Fnatic. The competition is heating up as we enter week six of play and Misfits are still looking to rival G2 for first place.

Bjergsen&#x2019;s Zed and Hauntzer&#x2019;s Shen showed excellent control and synergy in game three, which gave TSM an early advantage that allowed them to push for the win. FlyQuest suffered an unexpected defeat against Dignitas when Hai decided to pick Jarvan mid, which made it all too easy for Dignitas to play around. Team Liquid also suffered a heavy defeat in their game against Counter Logic gaming, but they still have a chance to show improvements when they face Immortals today.

        "contents": "CS:GO players take a lot of pride in their ranks. Ranks represent countless hours spent learning the game and applying your skills alongside teammates. But for how much players tend to fret over their arbitrary skill group, there&apos;s not much info out there about how the ranks work. Generally, playing better will eventually rank you up, but Valve remains tight-lipped about the inner workings. To help you understand this system better, we&apos;ve collected the best-available information from Valve and a variety of other sources. How CS:GO ranks work * To earn your initial rank, you&apos;ll have to <em>win</em> 10 placement matches, at a limit of two per day. These allow time for the game&#x2019;s ranking system to determine your caliber. Note that an unranked player will be unable to queue with anyone of rank Master Guardian 2 or higher, unless queuing with a full team of five. * Once you&apos;ve earned those 10 wins you&#x2019;ll be assigned into one of <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2D423WGxiYRWUFOWlY4N3RzMDA\">; 18 Skill Groups </a>, depending on your performance. You&#x2019;ll now be able to play as many matches as you like, but can only queue with players within +/- 5 ranks of your own (once again, excluding a team of 5 queuing). * Based on successes and failures, your rank will be adjusted at the end of each match, assigning you a higher or lower Skill Group if necessary. The mechanics behind this are still unclear, but the surest way to improve is by winning as a team. * Play no matches for a month and your Skill Group will disappear, requiring a win or draw to return it. Again, you&#x2019;ll no longer be able to play with ranks above Master Guardian 1 until you&#x2019;ve earned it back. Rank distribution <a href=\"https://csgo-stats.com/ranks\" target=\"_blank\"> CSGOStats </a>, an independent analysis website provides a breakdown of the rank distribution, showing the percentage of active players in each rank over a day, week or month. This data is collected through randomly sampled matches, so extending the catchment period to a month gives a good idea of how the ranks spread out. In the sample above we can that the average rank is Gold Nova 3, with around 35% of all players sampled in the Gold Nova bracket. If you&#x2019;ve earned your way to Legendary Eagle, congrats, you&#x2019;re in the top 5% of matchmaking players. In fact, you might be even higher than you think. The site&#x2019;s random sampling technique means that because higher ranked players will, in general, play the game more often, they are disproportionately likely to be sampled. But what does each rank actually mean, and how does the game determine where to place you? <strong>Elo and Glicko-2</strong> Unsurprisingly, Valve has kept incredibly tight-lipped when it comes to the inner workings of its games, for fear that some players might game the system itself, prioritising their own progression over the success of their team. But back in 2015, a Valve employee <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2g3r4c/the_ultimate_guide_to_csgo_ranking/\"> let slip </a> that CS:GO initially based its matchmaking on the Glicko-2 ranking system, though it has since been adapted and improved, involving some heavy modifications.&#xA0; The more games you ve played, the harder it will be to change your rank. Chances are you&#x2019;ve heard of Elo ranking. Designed for player vs player competitions such as chess, each combatant is assigned a number to represent their rank. The difference between two competitor&#x2019;s numbers indicates the expected outcome of the match, with the victor claiming points from the loser. Should the player of higher rank win, he&#x2019;ll take significantly fewer points than the lower player would, outcome reversed. Since the adoption of Elo, many variations have been designed to combat some of the system&#x2019;s flaws. <a href=\"http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html\"> Glicko-2 </a> is one such alternative, assigning a Ratings Deviation (RD) around a base number. A player&#x2019;s Match Making Rank (MMR) then becomes a range (e.g. ), rather than a single number (e.g. 1500). This improves accuracy; the system can then say it knows a player&#x2019;s rank will lie within this bracket to a 95% certainty. The better the system knows your real rank, the smaller this range will be. Glicko-2 also takes into account a player&#x2019;s &apos;volatility,&apos; how much a rank is expected to fluctuate over time (increased through erratic performances, decreased through consistency). However, despite Glicko-2 being an open system, clear limitations stop it from applying directly to CS:GO. Both Elo and Glicko were designed with 1v1 competition in mind. In a 5v5, team-based game, far more factors come into play. An individual player&#x2019;s impact on a game is a difficult thing to judge. Sure, one player can earn four kills in a round, but that may only be because of an ally securing the bomb-plant, or placing a well-timed flash. From K/D ratios to MVPs, performance statistics are varied, and Valve has said nothing about how they&#x2019;re taken into account with regards to rank. In response to this silence, some players have their own theories on how CS:GO&#x2019;s ranking system works. Player theories Back in 2014, Steam user RetriButioN <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312582297\"> posted a lengthy record </a> of his experience ranking up multiple accounts. He&apos;s since updated the guide, acknowledging that all claims are based purely off his own anecdotal evidence, but it makes for an interesting read regardless. He proposes that ranking is determined on a round-by-round basis, adjusting all players involved to redetermine the expected winner. This method could explain why players sometimes rank up on a lost game, given a close scoreline. The chances of this occurring are extremely low, but multiple players have reported unexpected changes in rank&#x2014;see Infamous_Blue&#x2019;s comment <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/20wkge/after_8_smurf_accounts_i_believe_i_have_figured/cg7j3yo/\"> here </a> as an example. However, these cannot act as hard evidence for a round-by-round system, as external factors (e.g. previous games being removed due to a detected cheater) can also influence your ranking during a match. These outside events are more likely to explain especially bizarre claims like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/21b3ma/i_just_deranked_from_a_160_win/\"> deranking after a 16-0 win. </a> RetriButioN also goes on to claim that, aside from winning and losing the round, MVPs are the only factor to affect your ranking score. The logic behind this and the guide came from the use of console command, &apos;developer 1,&apos; which revealed a ranking number that changed based on rounds and MVPs. However, Valve has dispelled this claim, confirming that files stored on the user-end no longer affect ranking. However, if MVPs previously played a role, there&#x2019;s chance that they still do. Recently, reddit user dob_bobbs <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/5tsemm/why_you_havent_ranked_up_yet/\"> shared his own thoughts </a>, covering the workings of the Glicko-2 system and suggesting that a high volatility may limit the loss or gain of points. The logic behind this is that a player may have an unusual bad patch or lucky streak, not indicative of their true skill, meaning that time to establish the trend is needed. What we know for certain With many fan theories floating around, it can be easy to get lost down a rabbithole of guesswork, but there are some key takeaways from what&#x2019;s been learned.&#xA0; <strong>A wide number of factors affect your ranking, and it&#x2019;s all stored by Valve. </strong>&#x201C;All computations are performed on our matchmaking backend and multiple matchmaking parameters describing scientific set of rating variables of a player are represented to players as ,&#x201D; posted vitaliy_valve in response to RetriButioN&#x2019;s guide. No matter how much data mining someone claims to have done, they cannot know the details of the matchmaking system. With a number of variables in effect, it&#x2019;s better to focus on winning the game than arguing over factors like who gets to defuse the bomb, even if someone tells you otherwise. <strong>The more games you&#x2019;ve played, the harder it will be to change your rank. </strong>The nature of Glicko-2&#x2019;s Rating Deviation means that the longer you play at a particular level, the more precisely the game will believe it has determined your appropriate rank. With a smaller RD, larger jumps in your MMR become improbable. If you&#x2019;ve ever seen a popular streamer or Youtuber attempt to rank an account from Silver 1 to Global, you&#x2019;ll notice that it usually takes a long time to progress during the Silver stages. This happens because the account has been intentionally deranked by a player losing repeated games on purpose. During this time, the rating system will believe it has obtained a good idea of the player&#x2019;s true rank, and therefore responds slowly to subsequent victories. This isn&#x2019;t to say you&#x2019;ll never be able to climb the levels again. Given consistent hard work and competition with those above your level, your RD will widen again, allowing greater steps up. <strong>A hiatus will reduce your rank&#x2019;s certainty, but often leads to degradation. </strong>Quit playing CS:GO for a month, and you&#x2019;ll find your skill group has vanished, requiring a draw or win to earn it back. If you stop playing for longer, there&#x2019;s a good chance you&#x2019;ll return at a different rank than before. It has often been suggested that MMR decays over time when inactive, but again it&#x2019;s tough to find evidence to back this up. The most probable cause for degradation comes from increases in Rating Deviation.&#xA0; Your ranking range becomes less certain over time between games, increasing in RD. Each sudden drop represents a match played, letting the system believe it can more precisely identify your true rank. The longer it has been since your last match, the less certain the game can be of your level, which means you could be matched against players of a wider skill range than you would normally. If you&#x2019;re in the upper half of the skill groups, you&#x2019;re more likely to be matched against those lower than you due to the larger pool of players. However, if you find your rank has dropped then it&#x2019;s best not to worry, as your increased RD should allow faster recovery. ",

Detecting and smiting cheaters is a thankless task too, with most folk ignoring anti-cheat technology unless it stops working effectively. Typically enough, Valve has a new approach in mind. During a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/5u2xly/eli5_why_are_spinbots_not_autodetected_or_atleast/\">discussion</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> Reddit page, one user asked why Valve doesn&apos;t implement auto-detection for spinbots &#x2013; bots that literally spin on the spot, auto-killing every player in range. Other users posit quite reasonably that it wouldn&apos;t be hard to detect this supernaturally quick and effective player behavior. That may be true, but according to a Valve spokesperson writing in the thread, it wouldn&apos;t be the best approach. &quot;So some bad news: any hard-coded detection of spin-botting leads to an arms race with cheat developers &#x2013; if they can find the edges of the heuristic you&#x2019;re using to detect the cheat, the problem comes back,&quot; the spokesperson wrote. &quot;Instead, you&#x2019;d want to take a machine-learning approach, training (and continuously retraining) a classifier that can detect the differences between cheaters and normal/highly-skilled players.&quot; That sounds simple enough if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s at stake, but actually, it&apos;s an approach to anti-cheat which ups the ante entirely: both in possible effectiveness and the sheer cost of operating it. &quot;The process of parsing, training, and classifying player data places serious demands on hardware, which means you want a machine other than the server doing the work. And because you don&#x2019;t know ahead of time who might be using this kind of cheat, you&#x2019;d have to monitor matches as they take place, from all ten players&#x2019; perspectives.&quot; The spokesperson continued: &quot;There are over a million CS:GO matches played every day, so to avoid falling behind you&#x2019;d need a system capable of parsing and processing every demo of every match from every player&#x2019;s perspective, which currently means you&#x2019;d need a datacenter capable of powering thousands of CPU cores.&quot; Apparently Valve has &quot;started this work&quot; and already has an early version of the system deployed to Overwatch &#x2013; a self-regulated community dedicated to reviewing cheat reports in the game. The company will &quot;continue this work and expand the system over time&quot;. ",

        "contents": "Photo credit: Heather 'sapphiRe' Garozzo As the bombastic opening to last month&#x2019;s ELEAGUE Major demonstrated, esports have come a long way since the LAN parties of the &#x2018;90s. Within this developing environment, more and more unique careers are emerging. While CS:GO&#x2019;s casters and analysts rival even the players in popularity, a further selection of vital backstage roles are only just starting to gain attention. Chief among these unsung heroes are CS:GO&#x2019;s observers. What is an observer? By controlling the in-game camera, the observer decides which player perspectives or camera angles are broadcast during the match. When you&#x2019;re watching an online stream, every viewpoint is chosen by them. With the onus on ensuring that the big plays are captured each round, the difference between a good and bad observer is not to be understated. Experienced observers are few and far between, and as tournaments continue to expand, it&#x2019;s a position increasingly in demand. I had the chance to speak with Heather &#x2018;sapphiRe&#x2019; Garozzo, one of CS:GO&#x2019;s most accomplished observers, on what the role entails. &#x201C;An observer is essentially an in-game director for a match,&#x201D; Heather says. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a main director who&#x2019;s telling people when to go in game, when to look at the team, the analyst&apos;s desk or the host. Then there&#x2019;s the in-game director which is the observer. My job is to direct the action in the game. Essentially I&#x2019;m a storyteller. I&#x2019;m telling the story of a round or the match.&#x201D; A former professional competitor, Heather has been playing CS since its initial release in 1999. Alongside her gaming career, Heather began covering CS:Source as a freelance writer, travelling at her own expense to cover various events. Eventually noticed by companies such as ESEA and ESL, Heather moved onto CS:GO coverage until, out of the blue, she was asked to observe a match. &#x201C;One weekend, former competitive player impulsivE said he needed an observer,&#x201D; recalls Heather. &#x201C;I said you need a what? An observer? I guess I&#x2019;ll give that a shot. I was kind of nervous as I&#x2019;d never done that before and hadn&#x2019;t really thought of an observer as a thing. I used to watch hundreds of demos, thousands of demos of teams for analytical articles. It turns out I was pretty comfortable with it.&#x201D; As it happened, this match was part of the 2015 ESL One Cologne Major Qualifier and opened the door to a career that few playing the game were even aware of. Since then, Heather has worked at a great number of notable events including the MLG Columbus Major and ESL Pro League Season 2 Finals. Know the players, know the game Anticipating the key moments in each round is no easy task, with players often spread across all corners of the map. A good knowledge of the scene is therefore a great boon. Getting a grasp of which players are the main entry fraggers, AWPers and lurkers is just the beginning. Getting to know the players themselves is the real goal. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d say what really sets me apart from the average observer is that, because I get to observe these guys so often, I know their style,&#x201D; says Heather. &#x201C;Like KennyS. He likes to play these very aggressive angles on Dust2. We&#x2019;re watching the map most of the time, so we&#x2019;re watching little dots on the radar. We&#x2019;re not just clicking round through players trying to find something. When I see KennyS&#x2019;s dot on that particular spot and I know he has an AWP? I&#x2019;m probably gonna switch to him if I see a T approaching.&#x201D; &#x201C;Another example is Stewie2K,&#x201D; Heather adds. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s typically known for pushing through smokes. A lot of players see smokes as a wall. Not Stewie&#x2014;don&#x2019;t switch off him because he&#x2019;s probably going to do something crazy. I think it really makes a difference for me, it allows me to be more reactive when I can anticipate the players.&#x201D; Photo credit: Helena Kristiansson/ESL Caster relationships This knowledge extends beyond those competing to the external talent. Another key part of an observer&#x2019;s work is to compliment the casters. During a match, casters are often in direct communication with the observation team, making requests for specific viewpoints or statistics. Working in tandem over a number of tournaments, Heather has built up a rapport with CS:GO&#x2019;s top casting talent, and is able to adapt her style to suit them. &#x201C;I have to work very closely with &#x201D; says Heather. &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t have a good observer, the talented casters are going to be unable to do their job. They&#x2019;re the narrators and I&#x2019;m directing for them. I&#x2019;m fortunate enough that I get to travel to a lot of different events. I&#x2019;m seeing these guys every other weekend so I get to know them and build up a chemistry.&#x201D; &#x201C;Sadokist likes to call things out that he wants to talk about, so I have to queue those up for him on the main screen,&#x201D; Heather gives as an example. &#x201C;Semmler likes to cover how many players lived or died on previous rounds so I need to dig into the scoreboard and damage done on players. It really helps to get to know their style. To the audience we want it to look like one complete package, not a bunch of different people.&#x201D; Photo credit: Heather 'sapphiRe' Garozzo Rules of thumb The level of involvement and prior knowledge required to reach the top might seem daunting, but Heather is quick to offer some basic tips to improve your observing significantly. &#x201C;There&#x2019;re definitely a few rules of thumb. For example, in a 1v2 I&#x2019;m almost always going to put the camera on the one person, because he&#x2019;s always more likely to do something more impressive or pull off a clutch,&#x201D; Heather advises. &#x201C;When 5 Ts are pushing one CT, I could keep trying to guess which one is going to get the kill, but the better guess is to go on .&#x201D; An observer&#x2019;s goal is to consistently find the most exciting part of the match. This can involve swapping between both sides based on the pace of a team or which segment of the round is occurring. &#xA0;&#x201C;At the beginning of the round, you usually want to show the terrorists as they&#x2019;re the ones that need to advance on the map,&#x201D; says Heather. &#x201C;What they&#x2019;re doing is the most important thing on the map, unless the CTs do something special. Let that part unfold and then, when they&#x2019;re about to execute onto a site, you often want to switch to the CTs.&#x201D; How to start observing If observing sounds like your thing, the tools included in CS:GO make starting out easier than ever&#x2014;but you&#x2019;ll need to earn some experience before you hit the big leagues. Fortunately, Heather suggests, there is plenty of demand. &#x201C;I think of it as similar as the route to casting,&#x201D; says Heather. &#x201C;ESL is not going to hire you without some sort of experience, as you&#x2019;re working with the directors and producers. Even after I got my start at ESL, I tried to do a lot of things on my own. For example on ESEA, or ESL and FACEIT there are literally hundreds of matches every night which go unstreamed, and people want to watch those. That&#x2019;s a great opportunity to practice and build content on your Twitch stream. It&#x2019;s as easy as firing up your stream on a match page.&#x201D; An additional route is to work with those keen to get involved in other areas. The popularity of match commentators like Anders Blume and Henry &#x201C;HenryG&#x201D; Greer has led to many new faces keen to practice their casting talent. Most will be more than keen to work with an observer and ease their workload. &#x201C;I think that would be a great way to do it,&#x201D; Heather says. &#x201C;You have caster duos but I think it would be cool to have caster-observer duos. It&#x2019;s really hard to cast and observe at the same time, so observe for them and you can both get experience.&#x201D; Photo credit: Heather 'sapphiRe' Garozzo Deserving attention By virtue of being an off-camera role, observing has been slow to gain recognition by the community&#x2014;but times are changing. Last year&#x2019;s ESL Pro League Season 2 Finals included observers among their talent announcement, and casters have even been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamesbardolph/status/811646282859159552\"> making an effort to commend their good work </a>. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s such a nice feeling when they do that and it&#x2019;s great to know we&#x2019;re getting more attention,&#x201D; says Heather. &#x201C;I definitely notice that. Things as simple as that when the crew are picked up in the morning, we go with the talent. Casters are going to have preference for who they want to work with. Even on reddit too a lot of people get excited when a particular observer is announced.&#x201D; With most observers starting out as fans and players of the series, it&#x2019;s fantastic to see their work gain appreciation in the audience. As esports evolve, here&#x2019;s hoping these hidden stars continue to be acknowledged. ",

All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. Have a great weekend! <strong>CS:GO: ELEAGUE Major 2017</strong> The CS:GO ELEAGUE quarterfinals begin today as Natus Vincere and Astralis take to the stage. We expect flamie will bring the firepower Navi needs to beat Astralis in the upcoming match, but we&#x2019;ll have to see if his precise bursting and multi-kill capabilities are enough to stop their onslaught. The competition has already been extremely fierce as teams battle not only for progress, but survival. The schedule can <a href=\"http://www.eleague.com/eleague-schedule\"> be found here </a>, while the event will be streamed live via the ELEAGUE channel on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/eleaguetv\"> Twitch </a>. <strong>Overwatch: Winter Premiere</strong> NGE&apos;s Winter Premiere tournament now has its top four teams, who will be advancing to the live LAN finals at PAX South: Immortals, Kungarna, compLexity and Luminosity Gaming. Many fans are excited to see how Kungarna handles themselves against some of the more established teams, as they are considered to be the underdog going into the semifinals. However, every team will be looking to snag their share of the $100,000 prize pool and claim this year&#x2019;s title. Semifinals kick off today at 10:00 PST / 19:00 CET, while the finals start the following day. The event can be watched over on<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/overwatch_nge\"> Twitch </a>. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 EU LCS Spring Split</strong> Once again, H2k and G2 clearly showed their dominance and as they prove they have what it takes to battle it out at the grand finals. G2&#x2019;s offseason training had greatly improved their performance on the Rift and this was shown when they defeated Fnatic and ROCCAT in week one. However, teams like Fnatic, UOL, Misfits and Giants have yet to improve and show their fans that they can challenge the top contenders. The full schedule and stream can be found over on <a href=\"http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/eu-lcs/eu_2017_spring/schedule/default\"> LoL Esports </a>. <strong>League of Legends: 2017 NA LCS Spring Split</strong> Both Cloud9 and OG Cloud9 AKA FlyQuest are currently sitting at the top of the table after what seemed to be a repeat of last year&#x2019;s events. Echo Fox struggled to close out games and Counter Logic Gaming nearly gave their fans multiple heart attacks. However, most eyes were focussed on the rookie NA junglers and Korean import top laners who made their debuts in this year&#x2019;s LCS. We&#x2019;re even starting to see just how OP Camille is.

The team had spent a lengthy amount of time out of the public eye and no one knew how the team would perform, especially against Team Dignitas and Fnatic. However, Misfits managed to come out on top, proving to critics and fans alike that they&#x2019;re still a top contender. Tempo Storm will face Team Freedom today at 14:00 PST / 23:00 CET.

I&apos;m no competitive CS:GO expert myself, but it&apos;d seem Team EnVyUs&apos; decision to stagger their attacks made things easier for jdm64 here, however that&apos;s not to take away from his resolve and skill in this four versus one situation. The remainder of the match went into triple-overtime as a result of jdm64&apos;s class, however the rounds that followed saw Team EnvyUs retain the upper hand&#x2014;eventually going on to win 25-21.&#xA0; Still, top backs-to-the-wall work from Marzano. &#xA0; Thanks, <a href=\"http://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/01/counter-strike-pro-wins-epic-shootout-against-the-entire-enemy-team/\">Kotaku Australia</a>.

All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below. <strong>Dota 2: World Electronic Sports Games</strong> The World Electronic Sports Games event kicked off yesterday at the Changzhou Olympic Sports Center, China. The LAN finals event is the last part in the race for the whopping $1.5 million prize pool. A total of 24 teams have managed to secure their place in the final stage after nearly five months of gruelling regional qualifiers. However, it&#x2019;s not all about the money as the tournament marks a historic moment in the Dota 2 competitive circuit. The WESG is currently the only event to offer over a million USD prize pool to teams formed exclusively from five players of the same nation. The full weekend schedule can<a href=\"http://www.wesg.com/index.php/grandfinal/schedule\"> be found here </a>, while the event can watched over on<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dotastarladder_en\"> Twitch </a>. <strong>StarCraft II: World Electronic Sports Games</strong> StarCraft II also has a fairly hefty prize pool up for grabs in China this week. The WESG will be giving out $402,000 in StarCraft prizes, which is considerably less than some of the others games, but it&#x2019;s still a substantial sum. The quarterfinals start today at 22:00 PST / 07:00 CET, while the semifinals begin tomorrow at 19:00 PST / 04:00 CET. You can watch all the action over on<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/starladder_sc2_en\"> Twitch </a>. <strong>CS:GO: World Electronic Sports Games</strong> CS:GO also kicked off its group stage last night and will resume today. The quarterfinals start tomorrow, while the semi-finals and the grand final will be taking place on the same day, January 15th. There has already be an unexpected surprise as the Swedish CS:GO team GODSENT will no longer be attending the WESG grand final. GODSENT were set to compete against teams such as Signature, Team Kinguin, Space Soldiers, Bravado Gaming, and FIVE eSports Club before they bowed out.

His most difficult opponent will likely be fellow European player Liam &#x201C;Lbdutchboy&#x201D; Brouwer from the Netherlands. &#xA0;Xixo was the highest ranked Hearthstone player on the GosuGamers ladder last year, as he won the StarSeries Season 2 and defeated Jon &#x201C;Orange&#x201D; Westberg in the European WESG qualifiers.

That&apos;s what Jason, better known online as &apos;<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/onehandfps\"> OneHandFPS </a>,&apos; discovered when a motorcycle accident left him paralyzed in his left hand. In an instant, the WASD setup that we all use, along with dozens of other things, became impossible for him. But, amazingly, that hasn&apos;t come between Jason and his love of gaming. I would know. I challenged him to a duel in CS:GO and he kicked my ass with what might as well have been one hand tied behind his back. Though his accident was only eight months ago, Jason streams his attempts to get back into gaming on Twitch. Unable to play by traditional means, he uses a <a href=\"http://www.razerzone.com/ca-en/gaming-mice/razer-naga\"> Razer Naga </a> MMO mouse&#x2014;the one with 12 buttons on the side&#x2014;to do just about everything I would use a keyboard for. He&apos;s still able to use the weight of his left hand to push a button or two on his keyboard if he absolutely has to, but everything from moving to swapping weapons is done on the mouse. If it wasn&apos;t for the second webcam pointed at his hands when he streams, you might never notice that Jason is only using one of them. That&apos;s how good he is. But getting there, he tells me, has been a struggle.&#xA0; The road to recovery&#xA0; What was supposed to be another day of riding motorcycles with his brother turned into a disaster when Jason lost control and steered into a wall, flipping over and falling 35 feet to the ground below. &quot;I broke multiple vertebrae,&quot; he says. &quot;I have a T5 fusion in my back. I broke my scapula. I broke my right arm, my left hand was severely dislocated. They said I broke all of my ribs. My spleen also exploded, so that had to be removed.&quot; In all, he spent nine days recovering in the hospital. But when his left hand still hadn&apos;t regained feeling, Jason worried something was wrong. &quot;After going through a bunch of tests, they determined that I severed some nerves in my brachial plexus which is in my neck,&quot; he says. &quot;So they think I pulled them out of my spinal column.&quot; The diagnosis wasn&apos;t positive. While there might be some procedures to restore a little bit of movement, Jason&apos;s left hand was paralyzed. For Jason, who tells me he&apos;s been playing on the PC for years, that was hard to take. &quot;Gaming is a huge part of my life, it&apos;s like my favorite thing in the world,&quot; he says. &quot;I was like, how am I going to play games? Am I ever going to be able to play Counter-Strike again? Am I ever going to be able to play games with my brothers and my friends?&quot;&#xA0; But Jason didn&apos;t waste any time trying to figure out a way. He very quickly figured out that a game like Diablo 3 could easily be played entirely using the mouse, so he started slaughtering demons to help pass the time he spent at home in recovery. Take one look at the most played games on his Steam profile, however, and it&apos;s easy to see that Jason is a Counter-Strike guy at heart. Eventually he longed for the sandy corridors of de_dust2. After a somewhat successful attempt to play the Overwatch beta, he decided it was time to give Counter-Strike a try. &quot;What I did was I went into a deathmatch&#x2014;I didn&apos;t change any &#x2014;and I just sat there. I let people come to me and I&apos;d just kill them.&quot; It was hardly playing, but it was just enough to motivate him to try a little harder. &quot;I was like, if people are missing this bad while I&apos;m standing still, it can&apos;t be too bad if I try moving around,&quot; he says. &quot;So I decided to try to rebind of Counter-Strike.&quot; With some experimentation, Jason found a setup that worked. And with each match he played, a sliver of his previous ability came back. In the time that we spent dueling each other, it was obvious that Jason is the better player. His aim is deadly, but movement is where he can stumble. Using his thumb to control his character means that he can&apos;t strafe and peek as effectively as most players. He also tells me that in hectic situations he&apos;ll sometimes switch guns due to hitting the wrong button. Still, that hasn&apos;t stopped him from ranking at Gold Nova III. &quot;I definitely get frustrated,&quot; he says. &quot;I know where I used to play at skill-wise, so sometimes it gets frustrating especially when I&apos;m in a . I always telling everyone that the only reason that I&apos;m probably where I&apos;m at right now is because of what I have of the game.&quot; But knowledge in Counter-Strike goes a long way. The first few times Jason came out on top, his brothers would always brag in chat about him pulling it off one-handed. When players didn&apos;t always believe them, they started encouraging Jason to stream himself playing. Though he was apprehensive at first, he quickly realized how sharing his story could be a positive thing. &quot;It&apos;s been amazing,&quot; he says. &quot;Through the streaming and whatnot, I&apos;ve met a bunch of great people. It&apos;s helped me tremendously&#x2014;talking to these people, talking about my accident, and not just storing it away.&quot; &#xA0; Becoming King of the Kill&#xA0; Months later and Jason streams just about every single day of the week. Though his audience is small, he delights in sharing his moments of triumph. Just over a week ago, he had what might be the most meaningful of those experiences. Out of the 150 people that stepped into a match of H1Z1: King of the Kill, Jason was one of two still standing. His opponent crouched behind a large boulder while he took cover behind a tree. Using a molotov for cover, Jason broke cover and rushed his enemy. Just as he closed in, his opponent opened fire but Jason proved to be the better shot. His reaction to winning is priceless.&#xA0; &quot;I play with two hands and I&apos;ve yet to win,&quot; writes one commenter. &quot;You put me to shame.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m super proud of myself,&quot; Jason says of that win. &quot;That meant the world to me at that moment.&quot; And already he says he&apos;s pushing himself towards his next challenge. Fans have been clamoring to see him tackle the will-breaking monstrosities hidden within Dark Souls, a game known for its difficulty but that&apos;s already been beaten with a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/2fndr6/i_completed_dark_souls_using_only_a_guitar/\"> guitar controller </a>, the world flipped <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GivagDcvFk0\"> upside down </a>, and using only <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m2a2dLdZ0M\"> voice commands </a>. He sounds nervous when he tells me about it, but says he&apos;s willing to give it a shot. That kind of attitude is at the heart of Jason&apos;s message: &quot;After my accident, the only thing I could do was be positive. When I started playing games again the only thing I could do was be positive and know that I would never play on that same level,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to tell people that, yeah, this happened to me not too long ago, but we can still work through obstacles in our lives and we can still be positive.&quot; Jason might never reach that same level of skill he had before his accident, but I don&apos;t think he minds all that much. And you know what? Two hands or not, he can still kick some ass. If you ever see him in a game of CS:GO, tell him I want a rematch.&#xA0; ",

        "contents": "The openness of PC gaming allows anyone to contribute, from modders, Twitch streamers, and two-man dev teams to the biggest game studios in the world. But with no real regulator at the helm to set and enforce standards, it also means that everyone has shared ownership of the platform, opening the door to abuse, troublemakers, and scandal. Pour a glass of dramamine and revisit the finest flubs that graced PC gaming this year. From least-most controversial to most-most controversial, these are the stories that drew the greatest negative reaction from the PC gaming community in 2016. Scorched Earth added a ton of new stuff: new creatures like the deathworm and the mantis, new features, over 50 new items, and the centerpiece, six desert biomes. ARK: Scorched Earth The pressure on Steam&apos;s Early Access program has only increased since its introduction in March 2013. Although Early Access has yielded excellent games like Darkest Dungeon, Don&apos;t Starve, Offworld Trading Company, Subnautica, Divinity: Original Sin, Infinifactory, RimWorld, and Kerbal Space Program, some PC gamers remain reluctant to buy into unfinished games and the uncertainty that the Early Access label sometimes carries. In September, Studio Wildcard dealt a blow to Early Access&apos; reputation when it released Scorched Earth, the first paid expansion for Ark: Survival Evolved. At $20, it was two-thirds the cost of the base game. Many fans were unhappy to see a game that was by definition unfinished getting post-release content. On the third most-popular post on the Ark subreddit ever, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/50obbd/kinda_pissed_off_with_the_release_of_an_expansion/d75owpq/\"> one fan criticized </a>: &quot;We paid for the developers to finish Ark: Survival Evolved, instead they took our money and made another game with it.&quot; Studio Wildcard <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/ark-survival-evolved-dev-responds-to-paid-expansion-controversy/\"> defended its decision </a> saying that implementing an expansion early would make the technical process easier for future expansions. <em>More reading: </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/ark-survival-evolved-dev-responds-to-paid-expansion-controversy/\"> <em><strong>Ark: Survival Evolved dev responds to paid expansion controversy</strong></em> </a> <em><strong> </strong></em> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-must-take-greater-ownership-of-steams-early-access-program/\"> <em><strong>Valve must take greater ownership over Steam&apos;s Early Access program</strong></em> </a> Nostalrius could accommodate as many as 11,000 concurrent players. Nostalrius Vanilla WoW (that is, a pre-expansion version of World of Warcraft) has remained a popular way to play the most popular MMO of all time. As Angus <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-takes-legal-action-against-vanilla-wows-biggest-private-server/\"> wrote </a> in April, &quot;Nostalrius is a time capsule: a beautifully nostalgic record of what a living world used to look like. It&apos;s a museum piece created by passionate fans with no official alternative.&quot;&#xA0; But it&apos;s against WoW&apos;s terms of service to operate an independent game server, even if that server takes no money from its community. In April Blizzard issued a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-takes-legal-action-against-vanilla-wows-biggest-private-server/\"> cease-and-desist </a> against Nostalrius, WoW&apos;s biggest vanilla server, which boasted 150,000 active players. The forecast was grim: Blizzard had shut down other vanilla servers before, and it felt unlikely that the internet <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/nostalrius-petition-passes-200k-signatures-mark-kern-to-deliver-it/\"> petition </a> that sprung up in response was going to reverse the action against Nostalrius. The server owners complied, shutting down Nostalrius in April, but the fight wasn&apos;t done. Shortly after, they managed a face-to-face <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/nostalrius-pm-reports-back-on-blizzard-meeting/\"> meeting </a> with Blizzard to press their case for the value of vanilla WoW. &quot;After this meeting, we can affirm that these guys WANT to have legacy WoW servers, that is for sure,&quot; wrote a Nostalrius admin. The story continued to develop as members of the Nostalrius team, seemingly uncontent with Blizzard&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-wont-talk-wow-legacy-servers-at-blizzcon-despite-nostalrius-campaigns/\"> lack of discussion </a> about the issue at BlizzCon, announced their plans to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-server-nostalrius-is-returning-under-a-new-name/\"> bring back </a> the server under a new banner, Elysium. Barring some change of heart by Blizzard, Elysium itself stands a decent chance of also getting shut down. But the resurrection of Nostalrius puts greater pressure on Blizzard to permit vanilla servers, lest it be embroiled in another battle with a big piece of the WoW community. <em>More reading: </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-server-blizzard-wants-to-shut-down/\"> <em><strong>Inside the WoW server Blizzard wants to shut down</strong></em> </a> The revised victory pose. Blizzard&apos;s buttroversy Debate about the portrayal of videogame butts came to a head in 2016 when, in a lengthy post on the Battle.net forums, player Fipps complained about a victory pose for Tracer, Overwatch&apos;s speedy and spunky attacker. &#x201C;I have a young daughter that everyday when I wake up wants to watch the Recall trailer again,&quot; Fipps wrote. &quot;She knows who Tracer is, and as she grows up, she can grow up alongside these characters. What I&apos;m asking is that as you continue to add to the Overwatch cast and investment elements, you double down on your commitment to create strong female characters. You&apos;ve been doing a good job so far, but shipping with a tracer pose like this undermines so much of the good you&apos;ve already done.&#x201D; Blizzard agreed, and promised to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/tracer-gets-new-victory-pose-still-has-butt-world-hopefully-moves-on/\"> amend </a> the pose. &#x201C;We want *everyone* to feel strong and heroic in our community. The last thing we want to do is make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented,&#x201D; game director Jeff Kaplan wrote.&#xA0; Then came criticism that Kaplan was caving to criticism, or worse &apos;censoring&apos; Overwatch in response to a complaint. &quot;We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision, and that&#x2019;s okay,&quot; <a href=\"http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20743015583?page=11#211\"> he wrote </a> in a second update. &quot;That&#x2019;s what these kinds of public tests are for. This wasn&#x2019;t pandering or caving, though. This was the right call from our perspective, and we think the game will be just as fun the next time you play it.&quot; Lost in the pile of this was how civil the original critique was. &quot;My main complaint is that there is no facet of Tracer&apos;s silly/spunky/kind personality in the pose. It&apos;s just a generic butt shot. I don&apos;t see how that&apos;s positive for the game,&quot; wrote Fipps in the original post. I continue to agree that the pose wasn&apos;t Blizzard&apos;s best. Really, the reaction to the reaction was bigger, as it fed into a wider conversation around sexualized characters, feminism, inclusiveness, player criticism and other issues in games. <em>More reading: </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-victory-pose-cut-after-fan-complains-that-its-over-sexualized/\"> <em><strong>Overwatch victory pose cut after fan complains that it&apos;s over-sexualized</strong></em> </a> We loved Forza Horizon 3, but not the UWP strings it's attached to. Microsoft&apos;s UWP Microsoft&apos;s latest courtship of PC gaming continues to be a mixture of good and bad. We loved <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/forza-horizon-3-review/\"> Forza Horizon 3 </a>, liked <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/gears-of-war-4-pc-review/\"> Gears 4 </a>, and found <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/halo-5-forge-multiplayer-on-pc-is-going-to-explode/\"> Halo 5: Forge </a> to be surprisingly great. But on the operating system side, things weren&apos;t all blue skies and green fields for PC gamers in 2016.&#xA0; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/phil-spencer-interview-on-microsofts-pc-gaming-strategy/\"> In March </a>, Microsoft asserted its plan to bring its biggest games to Windows through its Universal Windows Platform, a set of standards and restrictions meant to, in Microsoft&apos;s eyes, make it easier to publish applications across multiple Windows devices, improve security, and help developers write code under a more unified platform. Those modest benefits are outweighed massively by the danger of Windows becoming more of a closed platform. Among game companies, Epic Games CEO and co-founder Tim Sweeney was the most outspoken critic of UWP. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-pummels-microsofts-uwp-initiative/\"> In March </a>, Sweeney labeled the initiative &quot;a closed, Microsoft-controlled distribution and commerce monopoly,&quot; and called for others in the industry to oppose it. Sweeney didn&apos;t miss the opportunity to level more harsh words later in 2016. &quot;Slowly, over the next five years, they will force-patch Windows 10 to make Steam progressively worse and more broken,&quot; he warned <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/tim-sweeney-thinks-microsoft-will-make-steam-progressively-worse-with-windows-10-patches/\"> in July </a>. <em>More reading: </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-pummels-microsofts-uwp-initiative/\"> <em><strong>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney pummels Microsoft&apos;s UWP initiative</strong></em> </a> <em><strong> </strong></em> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/phil-spencer-interview-on-microsofts-pc-gaming-strategy/\"> <em><strong>Phil Spencer on Microsoft&apos;s PC plans: &quot;I wouldn&#x2019;t say our strategy is to unify&quot;</strong></em> </a> CS:GO's in-game items sparked multiple scandals. CS:GO skin gambling The stage for 2016&apos;s skin gambling debacle was set three years earlier, when Valve rolled out cosmetic microtransactions for CS:GO. These items could be traded, sold, and bought through Steam for as much as $400&#x2014;the maximum listing price on the Steam Community Market. It didn&apos;t take long for questionable, unlicensed third-party websites to realize they could use Steam bot accounts to automate item winnings and losings, and it didn&apos;t take long for dozens of flavors of skin gambling to spring up as CS:GO peaked in popularity. The lowest point so far in a story that continues to develop, though, was the revelation that two very popular YouTubers showed themselves winning thousands of dollars of items on a site called <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\"> CSGO Lotto </a> without mentioning or indicating in any way that they were the creators of CSGO Lotto. Oops. Exposed, TmarTn offered a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/tmartn-apology-video/\"> pitiful apology </a>, saying that his relationship with had been &quot;been a matter of public record since the company was first organized in December of 2015,&quot; presumably meaning that a public record existed of his co-ownership of the shady gambling website for someone else to uncover. There&apos;s no definitive verdict on the legality of in-game item gambling at this time, but you can expect the issue to continue to be explored in 2017. <em>More reading: </em><a href=\"http://pcgamer.com/tmartn-apology-video/\"> <em><strong>YouTuber owner of CS:GO betting site offers worst apology ever</strong></em> </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"> <em><strong>CS:GO&#x2019;s controversial skin gambling, explained</strong></em> </a> A beautiful alien dinosaur that existed only as marketing. No Man&apos;s Sky It was a perfect, ugly storm of some of the least-appealing trends in modern gaming: unchecked hype, unfinished games, last-minute <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/heres-the-deal-with-our-no-mans-sky-review/\"> review code </a>, bland procedural generation, and misleading marketing. Before that, though, heavy, sincere anticipation had formed around No Man&apos;s Sky. Here was a game from a small studio with an impossible promise: 18 quintillion planets, procedurally-generated wildlife, infinite exploration. In trailers, it looked like a massive step forward for the stagnating survival genre. To help Hello Games achieve these lofty designs, it had the backing of a major publisher in Sony. And No Man&apos;s Sky was delightfully mysterious, so much so that we were still answering <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/no-mans-sky-10-burning-questions-answered/\"> fundamental questions </a> about the game a month before launch, thanks to limited access to code. At a preview event, Chris was allowed to play for <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/no-mans-sky-hands-on/\"> less than an hour </a>.&#xA0; Concerning signs came in the days before release. A significant <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/massive-no-mans-sky-day-one-patch-increases-galaxy-sizes-fixes-exploits/\"> day-one patch </a> was on the way to fix major exploits. The PC <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/sean-murray-confirms-that-no-mans-sky-will-release-on-pc-three-days-after-ps4/\"> release date </a> itself wasn&apos;t announced until very late. A player who acquired a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/guy-playing-leaked-copy-of-no-mans-sky-claims-he-reached-the-center-but-wont-say-whats-there/\"> leaked copy </a> of the game was able to reach the center of this allegedly near-infinite galaxy very quickly. And in a strange move, Hello Games wrote a blog <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/no-mans-sky-maybe-isnt-the-game-you-imagined-says-hello-games-founder/\"> warning </a> players about the game one day before its launch on PlayStation 4. &quot;This maybe isn&#x2019;t the game you *imagined* from those trailers,&quot; wrote Sean Murray in a blog post that outlined, from his perspective, what the space game was and was not. &quot;I expect it to be super divisive.&quot; It was more than that. But initially, No Man&apos;s Sky became the biggest launch on Steam of 2016, hitting <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/no-mans-sky-sales/\"> 212,620 </a> concurrent players on PC. That&apos;s more than double the all-time peak of 2015 phenomenon Rocket League. In short order, the mystery unraveled. Two players, livestreaming simultaneously on launch day, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/no-mans-sky-multiplayer/\"> could not see one another </a> despite reaching the same location. The limitations of the game&apos;s procedural generation were revealed, as players shared screens and video of samey-looking aliens. And the hope that somewhere, cool, custom <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/if-youre-looking-for-no-mans-skys-missing-giant-sandworm-i-found-it-in-osiris-new-dawn/\"> snake monsters </a> were prowling the universe, disappeared. Players urged other players to seek refunds, and No Man&apos;s Sky&apos;s concurrent players <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/concurrent-players-no-mans-sky/\"> sunk </a>. Hello Games went quiet. Our reviewer, Chris Livingston, recaps the rest of the saga perfectly in our <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-pc-gaming-lows-of-the-year-2016/\"> lows of the year </a>: <em>And then there was the reaction to the reaction: Hello Games went </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-makers-of-no-mans-sky-need-to-start-talking-again/\"> <em>utterly silent</em> </a><em> for a couple of months. While I understand the reasoning&#x2014;when everything you&apos;ve ever said is suddenly under intense scrutiny, it makes sense to be careful saying anything else&#x2014;the impenetrable silence only made matters worse, as fans felt they had been completely abandoned and ignored. At least things have gotten better recently, with new features added in the Foundation update, and the promise of more changes to come in the future.</em> <em>There are lessons to be learned on all sides. Devs: keep in mind that no one ever forgets what you say during development, and while it&apos;s fine to talk about the elements you hope to put in your game, you&apos;re going to hear about it if those things aren&apos;t actually there when you release it. Plus, completely shutting off all communication with the people who have bought your game is a terrible idea.

And, we need to be patient. Even if developers aren&apos;t talking, they&apos;re listening, and adding new features to a game takes time.</em> Ultimately, it was a pleasantly chill, but underwhelming neon planet generator that became the poster child of many of the things we dislike. The lingering thought is how differently things would&apos;ve gone if No Man&apos;s Sky had released in Early Access as a $20 or $30 beta. <em>More reading: </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-anatomy-of-hype-how-no-mans-sky-became-the-best-and-worst-game-ever/\"> <em><strong>The anatomy of hype</strong></em> </a> <em><strong> </strong></em> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/five-reasons-game-marketing-can-be-misleading/\"> <em><strong>Five reasons game marketing can be misleading</strong></em> </a> ",

        "contents": "Photo credit: Helena Kristiansson/ESL 2015 had its fair share of spectacular moments, but this year has seen the combination of individual skill with copious amounts of luck taken to whole new heights. From airborne multikills to superb finales, here are some of this year&#x2019;s standout moments for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Death has wings If this year left you feeling cold, that could only be a good sign: as Luminosity Gaming&#x2019;s Marcelo &apos;coldzera&apos; David demonstrated. In the first half of this year, LG (now SK Gaming) were carving a path through the best teams in the world. Running into Team Liquid in the semifinals of the MLG Columbus Major, they hit a bit of a bump. At 15-9 down, coldzera was the sole line of defence standing between Liquid and Mirage&#x2019;s B-bombsite. As it turned out, he was all the defence LG needed. Landing a jumping double-kill noscope is an unlikely prospect at the best of times, but for coldzera to pull it off <em>and</em> another two kills to save match point at a Major? Phenomenal. The blow proved too much for Liquid, who went on to lose the game in overtime. The full final can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2xmOmP3JEg\"> here </a>. The event has since been immortalized on the map with artwork of a winged AWP. You can find it tucked in by the van on the B-bombsite. Coldzera was such a fan of the piece that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EL/status/736397635527966720\"> he commissioned a tattoo artist to recreate it </a>. Simple sniping The AWP sniper rifle is Counter-Strike&#x2019;s most iconic gun, recognisable instantly by its thunderous boom. If you think yourself an expert, however, let Oleksandr &quot;s1mple&quot; Kostyliev enlighten you with some <em>less conventional</em> uses. Left in a 1v1 with his opponent holed up in Dust2&#x2019;s B-bombsite, s1mple throws both caution and his AWP to the wind in an audacious play. By hurling a massive gun over the wall, his opponent is distracted just long enough for s1mple to push in and take the round with a pistol. S1mple is no stranger to making bold plays and, clearly envious of coldzera&#x2019;s success, he couldn&#x2019;t help but pull of his own spectacular noscope kills. Taking an aggressive 1v2 fight, Simple drops from Heaven on Cache&#x2019;s B-bombsite, sniper in hand. Hitting one player on the way down, he then follows up with an absurd unscoped shot on the remaining terrorist. Map creator FMPONE was quick to mock up some artistic graffiti for the level, a change since added by Valve. Matching coldzera, s1mple had the work <a href=\"https://twitter.com/s1mpleO/status/784370680896819200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> tattooed onto his arm </a>. The best grand final: Luminosity Gaming vs. G2, ESL Pro League Season 3&#xA0; The best grand final: Luminosity Gaming vs. G2, ESL Pro League Season 3 The ESL Pro League Season 3 Grand Final hosted Brazilians Luminosity against the French G2 in a sublime five match finale. Taking place in May, LG were still riding high off their MLG Colombus Major victory. G2&#x2014;after barely scraping through qualification&#x2014; produced an underdog tale for the books, dominating the group stage before besting Fnatic in the semifinals. The final heralded one of the best series in years. Map five honoured Inferno with a fitting send off before its removal and eventual rework by Valve. Despite the map holding a heavy CT-bias, the two teams traded round after round in a brutal slugfest each half. Both sides so evenly matched, it took a heart-stopping overtime finish to establish a champion. Best of five series are extremely rare these days in CS, and the ESL Pro League proved just how much of a spectacle they can offer. If you&#x2019;d like to start from the beginning, game one can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5jZcO9HeE\"> here </a>. A first for North America: Cloud9 win the ESL Pro League&#xA0; Following the brilliant performance of SK Gaming, the standard of competition in North America (NA) has been driven to new heights. Everyone from Team Liquid to CLG has had their moment to shine, but none quite managed to capitalise on a large international win. Fortunately, when America needed a saviour, old favourites Cloud9 stepped up to the mantle. Ousting the defending champions SK gaming 2-1, they became the first NA team to win the ESL Pro League and claim the greater share of the $600,000 prize pool. A recent acquisition for C9, Timothy &quot;autimatic&quot; Ta gave an exemplary account, rising to the challenge time after time to dismantle SK. Following C9&#x2019;s success, OpTic Gaming have taken the ELEAGUE Season 2 crown, increasing NA&#x2019;s foothold on the international circuit. With a foot firmly in the door, the American fanbase can anticipate an exciting year to come. Fail of the year For every success in CS there will always be an accompanying failure, and some provide far more entertainment than others. Topping the list this year could be no other than Splyce&#x2019;s stand-in, Jaryd &quot;summit1g&quot; Lazar. At match point, 15-12, summit is left in a tense 1v1 against CLG&#x2019;s FugLy. After a short exchange, FugLy falls and Summit needs only defuse the bomb to claim victory. &#xA0;With the match all but over, the production cut to Splyce&#x2019;s booth in time to see the team erupt with an outburst of confusion and hilarity. Cut back to the game and we find summit has somehow died, earning CLG the round... Oh dear. Elated in victory, summit runs over his own molotov, taking a staggering 40 damage to kill himself. &#xA0;Adding insult to injury, CLG then went on to recover the match, beating Splyce in overtime 19-16. He may be a successful streamer, but summit is also likely to be the only player who managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The full match is available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wChfw65VjnM\"> here </a>. Unusual entertainment 2016 also saw a number of bizarre occurrences play out: * Virtus.Pro secured an economy round kill at star ladder with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Tg2cH90qI\">; surprising, five-man strategy </a>. * Sneaky Snax managed a ninja defuse against five Faze members when the ENTIRE team <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI9HgBHxw0\">; abandoned the bombsite to hunt him down </a>. * OpTic Gaming found themselves <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-VVH2r_55I\">; without a bomb to plant </a> after taking the bombsite from Astralis during the ESL group stage. * Immortals managed to win a round vs Cloud9 without even seeing their opponents. Unloading three M4s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=391Ce58R8-4\">; through a smoke grenade, they eliminate all five men. </a> Running on RNG 2016 has also seen interest in CS rise in the Eastern market, with China&#x2019;s Tyloo asserting themselves on the international stage by knocking world champions Luminosity Gaming out of the Dreamhack Masters Malmo. Making their way into the quarterfinals, Tyloo were met by the might of NaVi. At 12-8 down, Tyloo attacked Inferno&#x2019;s B-bombsite, producing an incredibly unconventional and unquestionably lucky AK headshot to take secure the plant. Jumping over the first set of boxes, Hui &quot;DD&quot; Wu annihilates Navi&#x2019;s AWPer with a single shot. Likely just looking for positional information, DD rolled the dice and came out on top, though NaVi would later take the match. The full game can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjXLUk3tqcc\"> here </a>. Moments like this are unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon, but the ELEAGUE Atlanta Major is just around the corner in 2017. Pitting the top teams against each other for a million dollar prize pool, CS fans will soon witness what the best of the best can be expected to achieve in the coming year.&#xA0; ",

        "contents": "Maybe you&apos;ve heard of our tiny piece of Counter-Strike history: a map called de_dust_pcg. It was released back in 2005 as a collaboration between Dave Johnston, the creator of the original Dust, and PC Gamer&#x2014;thus the title, right? As Johnston explains in this <a href=\"https://www.johnsto.co.uk/blog/a-third-dust-map/\">blog post</a>, it was originally created as a tutorial for the mag, and so &quot;it never quite got the attention and iteration that Dust and Dust 2 benefited from.&quot; But now it&apos;s getting a second chance, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzNVaAXmQj8\">3kliksphilip</a> has ported it from Counter-Strike: Source to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo/\">CS:GO</a>, and also put up a nice video overview of its history and the changes that were required to make the new version work. &quot;Retrospectively I&#x2019;m surprised at some of the choices I made, and the choices the layout exposes to players,&quot; Johnston wrote. &quot;The map clearly doesn&#x2019;t have the same depth of gameplay as Dust 2, sitting closer to the original Dust in terms of size and complexity&#x2014;perhaps it could be considered Dust 0.8 if these things were numbered in such a way. I&#x2019;m still unsure if the dropped bomb spot was a good idea, but it was certainly fun to try it.&quot;&#xA0; As a tutorial in a magazine, the map didn&apos;t get the iteration that Dust and Dust 2 did, but it also reflects the different priorities of that era, when the focus was on lowering the barriers to entry rather than &quot;the all-important metagames that help enshrine longevity.&quot; Gamers these days are more tolerant of complex map layouts, Johnston said, while modern game engines are better equipped to &quot;recreate and then exploit properties of real world to guide players around the virtual world.&quot; Because of that, he concluded, de_dust_pcg &quot;will probably leave most CS:GO players wanting a little... well, <em>more</em>.&quot;&#xA0; Maybe so, but it&apos;s free, which is a big selling point, and an interesting piece of videogame history to boot. It&apos;s available via the <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=821965396\">Steam Workshop</a>, and 3klikphilip&apos;s <a href=\"https://3kliksphilip.com/\">own site</a> lists some servers running it.

Experienced CS:GO players know that the point of CS:GO is to defend chickens with your life, especially after claiming one by targeting it and pressing &apos;use&apos; to make it follow you around. We must be even more vigilant when our chickens are wearing bright sweaters, as they&apos;re easier targets. Please protect the chickens this winter. Chicken sweaters were a feature in last year&apos;s CS:GO winter update, too. Aside from the increased fowl coziness, the latest patch&#x2014;which went out yesterday&#x2014;adds a new audio setting, Head-Related Transfer Function, which seeks to &quot;vastly improve 360 degree vertical and horizontal sound positioning.&quot; There are also some tweaks to public lobbies, the Nuke map, and a note that &quot;third-person weapon angles now visibly match first-person weapon recoil.&quot;&#xA0; Players can also buy $1 gifts to give out to random players in their matches, spreading some nice holiday cheer. (I tried to give a present to a chicken but it didn&apos;t work and I accidentally shot the chicken. I&apos;m sorry.)

        "contents": "Counter-Strike: Classic Offensive is a remake of Counter-Strike being made inside a remake of Counter-Strike. Yesterday the modder <a href=\"http://www.moddb.com/members/z00l/mods\" target=\"_blank\">Z00L</a> released a launch trailer for his curious mod, a project that aims to reproduce the look and feel of the original Counter-Strike (version &apos;1.6&apos; as it&apos;s more colloquially known) inside CS:GO. &quot;The main goal of the mod is to get the gameplay from 1.6 right into CS:GO including weapons, sounds, movement, all the old stuff you&apos;ve dreamed to see in CS:GO,&quot; he writes on ModDB. &quot;As you can see, I&apos;m pretty near.&quot; The mod is built within CS:GO&apos;s version of Source, and it&apos;ll require CS:GO to play. At launch, planned December 25, Z00L says that retro versions of Dust2, Italy, Mirage and Inferno will be playable. Each of these maps exist in the current version of CS:GO, of course, but they&apos;ve since been aesthetically and structurally reimagined in small or significant ways.&#xA0; As stated <a href=\"http://www.moddb.com/mods/counter-strike-classic-offensive/news/counter-strike-classic-offensive-whats-that\" target=\"_blank\">in August</a>, Z00L&apos;s goals with the project are to make weapons that behave similarly to 1.6, remove &apos;GO&apos;-specific guns, replace all sounds, and remove skins. He also outlines what he <em>is not</em> able to do as a result of the engine: * <em>Wallbangs as in 1.6 (even if I change it it won&apos;t penetrate more than 32units)</em>; * <em>Remake the crouching jumping bug (no I won&apos;t edit the dlls)</em>; * <em>Playermodel selection (a plugin could fix that though)</em>; * <em>See inside smoke particles (the game don&apos;t draw the world when inside, so nope..)</em>; * <em>Bring back the tactical shield</em>; * <em>Change flashes, smoke time, nade physics</em>; * <em>Add buying ammo </em>; So although the project is appetizing to folks like me who grew up playing 1.6 in internet cafes, it does seem to be operating under some fundamental constraints that might make it impossible to include certain movement quirks and &apos;desirable&apos; map bugs what were buffed out over Counter-Strike&apos;s different iterations. It&apos;s hard to tell from the in-game trailer exactly how well Classic Offensive captures the movement and weapon feel of old CS, but to my eyes it resembles the higher-fi Counter-Strike: Source more than anything. I guess that isn&apos;t unsurprising, considering it&apos;s the link between 1.6 and GO. Which version of Counter-Strike was the best, the most pure, or the most tactically interesting remains a hotly debated topic by FPS players. For the year following its release in 2012, <a href=\"http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=730q240q10&amp;from=1341126000000&amp;to=End+Time\" target=\"_blank\">CS:GO wasn&#x2019;t even the most popular version of Counter-Strike</a>&#x2014;some players were still <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike/comments/1ibjad/16_players_why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_csgo/\">actively arguing</a> the merits of GO against its thirteen- and nine-year-old predecessors.

Unrelated to the Blizzard FPS of the same name, Valve's Overwatch system gives select players the ability to watch replays of bad behavior reported by other players and impose penalties \"proportional to\" the offense: \"Suspects who are convicted of griefing are given a moderate cooldown, whereas cheaters are removed from the game entirely,\" the <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/\">CS:GO Overwatch FAQ</a> explains. But the update released yesterday takes some of that discretion out of the hands of judges, and imposes significantly harsher penalties on repeat offenders. Along with a small number of fixes, tweaks, and a wish for a happy Halloween, the October 25 <a href=\"blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2016/10/16815/\">patch notes</a> states, \"A temporary griefing conviction assigned by Overwatch will now be elevated to a permanent conviction if the suspect had a previous temporary griefing conviction.\" Two strikes and you're out, in other words, and even as someone who enjoys watching cheaters eat a hard swing of the banhammer, that seems a bit harsh.

The trouble, at least potentially, is that players who happen to be caught up in a false positive are faced with a real hassle: The \"Competitive Cooldowns and Bans\" FAQ opens with a <a href=\"https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1203-WJCV-7019\">stern warning</a>, outlined in red, that \"cooldowns and bans are non-negotiable and cannot be removed or reduced by Steam Support.\" Watch your step, kids.

        "contents": "<strong>Update:</strong> Valve has now issued a response to the Washington State Gambling Commission's call for action on the matter of CS:GO skin gambling, saying that it does not \"facilitate\" gambling through Steam, and that \"there is no factual or legal support for these accusations.\" The company said it is \"surprised and disappointed\" that the WSGC has chosen to pursue the matter publicly, but added that it has taken steps to discourage skin gambling on third-party websites, and is \"open to further cooperation with the Commission.\" In the firm but amicable letter, Valve's legal counsel notes that the company has no business relationship with gambling sites, does not promote them, and does not earn any revenues through them. These sites take advantage of two well-used Steam services in order to operate: the ability to purchase and trade skins, and the \"ubiquitous\" OpenID system of authentication that \"allows a Steam customer to identify himself on a third-party website by association with his Steam account, without having to give his Steam credentials to the third party site.\" \"We do not want to turn off the Steam services, described above, that skin gambling sites have taken advantage of,\" Valve's response letter says. \"In-game items, Steam trading, and OpenID have substantial benefits for Steam customers and Steam game-making partners. We do not believe it is the Commission s intention, nor is it within the Commission's authority, to turn off lawful commercial and communication services that are not directed to gambling in Washington.\" Despite expressing doubt that it is in fact breaking any laws in the first place \"If there is a specific criminal statute or regulation you believe Valve is violating, please provide a citation,\" the letter says Valve points out that it has already taken action against more than 40 skin gambling sites so far, first with cease-and-desist letters, and then by shutting down their Steam accounts. In the eyes of Valve's lawyer, though, it isn't realistic to expect Valve to hunt down every item-trading bot created by these websites. \"Cleverly designed bots can be indistinguishable from real users,\" reads the response, \"and their methods and techniques are constantly evolving.\" \"Valve can enforce its user agreements against the Steam accounts of skins gambling sites, where we can identify the site and identify the corresponding account. In fact, we would be happy to cooperate with the Commission, if it is able to identity more skins gambling sites that are illegal in Washington and the Steam accounts through which operate,\" the letter says. \"We welcome the change for further communication with the Commission, if it would like to clarify the legal allegations against Valve, or alternatively to work with Valve to identify offending Steam accounts of gambling sites.\" It is in many ways a bold response, although if the commission hasn't identified which laws Valve has broken after 18 months of talks, Valve is probably in a strong position within Washington State. But it also lays bare the complexities of the matter: Can Valve he held responsible for Steam users \"cashing out\" on third-party sites? Can it be held accountable for the actions of those third-party sites, whether or not it is actively \"facilitating\" them? Is Valve's sluggishness to police skin gambling an issue? To my non-lawyerly eyes, it would seem unlikely, but that 18 month stretch of negotiations works both ways: The WSGC clearly thinks it has some basis for complaint. On an unrelated but interesting note, the letter also confirms that Valve's employee headcount is \"approximately 360.\" This is the first updated measure of Valve's size that we've seen in years: Wikipedia lists it as having about 330 employees, but that's based on data from 2013. <strong>Original story:</strong> A couple of weeks ago, the Washington State Gambling Commission gave Valve <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/state-regulator-orders-valve-to-halt-csgo-skin-gambling-through-steam/\">until October 14</a> \"to respond and explain\" how Steam, and specifically the role it plays in skin gambling, is in compliance with the state's gambling laws. Failure to do so, it warned, could lead to \"civil or criminal action\" begin taken against the company. This was from an official state agency, so unlike our weekly cat gif email, the request could not be ignored. But this is also Valve we're talking about, and so naturally, the response did not arrive on time. \"At the close of business on October 14, 2016, a representative of Valve Corporation notified Commission staff that the company is still working on a reply to the Commission's Letter and a reply will be provided Monday, October 17, 2016,\" the WSGC said in a <a href=\"http://www.wsgc.wa.gov/docs/10-2016-valve-update.pdf\">press release</a> put out today. It almost feels like a gag, doesn't it? Valve can't even respond to an inquiry from a powerful state regulator on time. But unless there are some shenanigans afoot that go beyond even the most elaborate Freeman-based hoax, this is all entirely legit: The link to the release is front-and-center on the official <a href=\"http://www.wsgc.wa.gov/\">WSGC website</a>. \"I am disappointed that Valve Corporation missed Friday's deadline, but encouraged that they have committed to responding today,\" WSGC director David Trujillo said. \"I look forward to reviewing their response in detail.\" Protip for Dave: I look forward to playing Half-Life 3 someday, but I'm not penciling anything in on my calendar. You may have legislative clout on your side, but you can't change <a href=\"https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time\">the tides</a>. All you can do is learn to swim. I've reached out to Valve for more information and will update if and when I receive a reply. Thanks, <a href=\"https://pvplive.net/c/valve-set-to-respond-to-gambling-commission-after-\">PvPLive</a>.

        "contents": "After years of player-led lobbying, Valve has reintroduced graffiti sprays to Counter-Strike. There is, however, a catch. Absent since Counter-Strike: Source, graffiti sprays have now been added to Counter Strike: Global Offensive as consumable patterns which means players can obtain them in one of three ways: purchasing individual patterns from the Steam Market; purchasing Graffiti Boxes which \"feature art created by Steam Community Artists\"; or collecting patterns via free weekly drops as rewards for ranking up. Now, while modern Counter-Strikers are pretty accustomed to monetisation a process which inadvertently facilitated the recent <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-issues-cease-and-desist-orders-to-more-than-20-csgo-gambling-sites/\">skin betting scandals</a> Valve has also applied restrictions to the use of the sprays in-game. As outlined in this <a href=\"https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7737-UKVB-0657#howgraffiti\">Steam Community Q&A update</a>, once players unseal graffiti, they can apply the pattern 50 times (players who unseal a graffiti pattern already housed in their inventory will receive an additional 50 charges to their existing supply). Players can only apply graffiti once per round, however or every 45 seconds if matches run longer and one application of graffiti lasts just seven minutes and \"degrades over time until it is no longer visible.\" Check out the <a href=\"https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7737-UKVB-0657#howgraffiti\">Q&A in its entirety</a> for the minutiae of the matter.

        "contents": "Over the last few months Valve have released a steady stream of updates for CS:GO, replacing the audio for every gun and tweaking many other aspects of the game. Behind the scenes they ve also been hard at work fixing some of CS:GO s longstanding bugs and peculiarities. By tying the camera to the player model, hitboxes have been improved significantly, leaving no more excuses for those missed headshots at least until the next issue is found. Also gone are bizarre aerial exploits in which a player could land precise midair shots by counter-strafing or weapon swapping, as shown below. These changes have been long-awaited, and it s great to see a renewed interest from Valve in fine-tuning the game. However, CS:GO is no stranger to bugs, and plenty have haunted it for a long time. Collected below are some of the strangest ones that you can still find in the game today. Ethereal &#x2018;nades The inclusion of bouncing projectiles in hitscan shooters is always going to cause trouble, but grenades still provide more than their fair share. Clip a teammate when throwing any grenade, and you ll find it no longer collides with doors. Used on Cache s A-bombsite, defenders can be caught by an unexpected flashbang. Line up the angle just right and the grenade will skim your teammate without slowing, allowing you to set up useful smokes and Molotovs from a position of relative safety. Highlighted as far back as 2013, Valve don t seem in any rush to release a fix. Fortunately doors are far from common in competitive maps, reducing this bug s impact. Invisible Molotovs There s no questioning how dangerous molotovs can be, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7VTd9Oxa-E\"> with even the best falling victim from time to time </a>. Despite the large visual warning, It s easy enough to step accidentally into the hotzone during a firefight. A risk which becomes all the more deadly when the fire itself is invisible. If a Molotov or incendiary detonates just as it hits a player s feet, they will appear to smother the flames, spawning no fire around them. This won t stop the damage or audio, however. Moving will cause the flames to reappear, and few will stick around when a Molotov comes their way, making this bug unlikely to offer much of an advantage. Run boosting Like bunnyhopping, run boosts offer players an alternative method of movement with which to catch opponents off guard. While Valve has done much to curb use of the former, run boosting remains an effective strategy. By standing one player on top of another and running in tandem, the boost-ee is flung forward at high speed when jumping. Most often put to use in reaching unconventional spots on the map, it can also be used to take a waiting AWPer by surprise. Requiring two players to work in synchronisation, run boosting necessitates a high degree of risk in it s setup, making it a situational option at best. Popular with pros and fans alike, however, it s unlikely to disappear anytime soon. Watch Virtus.Pro put this to use against G2 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygybwSSWZE\"> here </a>. Venting frustration Valve s approach to updating maps is far from consistent. Levels are chosen here and there for revamps. It s great to see older maps receive a bit of polish, but it can also lead to some unusual differences worth knowing. For an AWPer, it s crucial to land that single-shot kill, an advantage removed when firing through any object. Shoot through a vent on Cache, Nuke or Mirage, and you ll find your damage drop below 90, even when aiming through the gaps. Repeat the exercise on Cobblestone however, and you can shoot through without breaking the vent itself. Vents have proven an interesting testbed in CS:GO, behaving differently on each map, and even made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAl4u68DvfM\"> open and closable </a> in Nuke s revamp (a change since revoked). An AWP failing to kill in one hit can be a matter of life and death for the shooter, making it well worth learning each map s individual quirks. Smoke bomb Counter-Strike s terrorists have tried as hard as possible to make their bomb noticeable, attaching a huge blinking light to the front. This might make it easy to find should you leave it lying around, but can also lead to some unintended downsides. Try to sneak through a smoke grenade while carrying the bomb, and you may find yourself an easy target. Those with a careful eye can also take advantage of this to spot when a dropped bomb is picked up inside smoke. Visibility of the bomb through smoke grenades is wildly inconsistent, but seems dependent on the bomb's position relative to the grenade. To reduce the chances of showing up, try to make sure you stick to the centre of the smoke or the far side of your opponent. When trying to recover the bomb, make sure the smoke overshoots the bomb s position slightly. Assorted oddities: stairs, swaps and sound Beyond vents, GO s maps exhibit some further irregularities in design, including smaller but noticeable differences in the way stairs behave. While some act as smooth ramps, others cause the player s viewpoint to bump up and down as you traverse them. Youtuber 3kliksphilip does a fantastic job of explaining the differences <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5B9ytF6gas\"> here </a>. If you ve ever had trouble picking up a gun at a crucial time, you re not alone. GO contains a 'press E to swap weapon' feature which proves unreliable at best. Should the gun lie anywhere near a grenade, the bomb or even another weapon, you may be unable to retrieve it, a problem which even causes the pros <a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/eleaguetv/MushyOryxOpieOP\"> some consternation </a>. Given the option, swap by dropping your original gun instead. Far from a bug but still an issue, CS:GO s surround sound leaves a lot to the imagination. While Horizontal audio is acceptable, verticality is all but indistinguishable, made most dangerously evident on Nuke s overlapping bombsites. A remedy would likely require an overhaul of the map, and that's unlikely to happen any time soon. CS:GO may have a long life ahead of it, but it s likely that many of these bugs will be along for the ride. ",

        "contents": "<strong>Update:</strong> In response to my inquiry, Valve's Doug Lombardi referred to the \"In-Game Item Trading Update\" <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-says-it-will-soon-start-taking-action-against-csgo-skin-gambling-sites/\">posted in July</a>, which states that using Steam to run a gambling business \"is not allowed by our API nor our user agreements,\" and warns that action will be taken against sites that do. \"Our position has not changed and so far we ve sent cease and desist notices to over 40 sites,\" Lombardi said. <strong>Original story:</strong> The Washington State Gambling Commission is demanding that Valve halt the transfer of <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">CS:GO</a> skins through the Steam API, which it says contravenes state gambling laws. In a press release posted by the <a href=\"http://www.esportsbettingreport.com/washington-state-valve-skin-betting/\">Esports Betting Report</a>, the regulatory agency gave Valve until October 14 to \"explain how it is in full compliance with Washington's gambling laws,\" and warned that failure to do so could lead to civil or criminal action being brought against it. The WSGC contacted Valve about the use of CSGO skins in online gambling back in February 2016, initially \"to determine if any additional action was needed.\" As a result of its investigation, the Commission has ordered Valve to \"take whatever actions are necessary\" to keep third-party sites from using the Steam platform to engage in skin gambling activities. \"All third party gambling sites have Steam accounts and use the Steam platform to conduct their gambling transactions,\" the commission said in the release. \"These gambling transactions are automated and performed by a software program or 'bot,' and have proliferated so much that a recent market report by Esports Betting Report indicates that one specific gambling website, CSGO Lounge, brought in approximately $1 billion in 'skin' gambling between January 1st and August 1st this year alone.\" \"In Washington, and everywhere else in the United States, skins betting on esports remains a large, unregulated black market for gambling. And that carries great risk for the players who remain wholly unprotected in an unregulated environment,\" Washington State Gambling Commissioner Chris Stearns said. \"We are also required to pay attention to and investigate the risk of underage gambling which is especially heightened in the esports world. It is our hope that Valve will not only comply but also take proactive steps to work with the Commission on future measures that will benefit the public and protect consumers.\" The spotlight was turned on CS:GO skin gambling earlier this year when it was revealed that YouTubers Trevor 'TmarTn' Martin and Tom 'ProSyndicate' Cassell were the <a href=\"www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\">owners of CSGO Lotto</a>, a site they had heavily promoted to their viewers without disclosing the relationship. Shortly thereafter, another YouTuber, PsiSyndicate, admitted that CS:GO skin gambling videos he'd posted to his channel were <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/youtuber-admits-that-his-csgo-skin-betting-videos-were-rigged/\">also rigged</a>. That led Valve to issue a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-issues-cease-and-desist-orders-to-more-than-20-csgo-gambling-sites/\">cease-and-desist order</a> against more than 20 CS:GO gambling sites a big move, but apparently not enough to satisfy the Commission. We took an up-close look at the ins and outs of skin gambling, including a breakdown of how it works and questions about its legality, that you can <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\">dig into here</a>. I've reached out to Valve for comment, and will update if and when I receive a reply. ",

        "contents": "If you play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, prepare to see a lot of guns being hurled over walls in the coming weeks thanks to a dramatic clutch victory by team Natus Vincere. During the ESL One New York semifinals, European team Natus Vincere (Na'Vi for short) squared off against Team Liquid a team so fearsome even rapper Ice-T shook the dust off his shoulders to step into the spotlight to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/782378844082679808\"> send a warning </a>: \"Don't fuck with Liquid 'cause they're going to bust that ass.\" Apparently, Oleksandr s1mple Kostylev, a recent addition to Na'Vi and one-time member of Team Liquid, didn't get that message. During the third and final game of the match, s1mple once again lived up to his reputation for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj-3kUXmRoc\"> stylish gunslinging </a>. In the final moments of round five, he faced off solo against Nicholas \"nitr0\" Cannella. With nitr0 ready to plant the bomb inside bombsite B on Dust2 and s1mple stuck on the outside with no backup, things weren't looking great for Na'Vi. And then Kostylev did something ludicrous. Just as Cannella planted the bomb, Kostylev approached the window leading into bombsite B, directly above Cannella, and hurled his AWP over the wall. Cannella, sensing movement, turned to face the flying rifle in a moment of confusion as Kostylev came through the window a split second later and planted a few pistol rounds in Cannella's head. The crowd went wild, the round was won, and the commentators were stunned. \"What even is that?\" asked one of them immediately following the play as both struggled to comprehend s1mple's strategy. In CS:GO, throwing weapons isn't uncommon. Players will sometimes hurl a pistol around corners or over walls to try and make enemy players believe it's a flashbang, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-sleight-of-hand-watch-this-incredible-flashbang-fakeout/\"> as Swag did </a> so memorably a couple years ago. As enemies turn away to avoid the flash, players can rush and catch them off guard. But hurling an AWP is practically unheard of and certainly took Cannella by surprise. In the tight corners of bombsite B, the AWP wasn't going to be of much use to Kostylev, so using it as a distraction does make sense but it's still bold as hell. \"That is just him styling on nitr0,\" one of the ESL's commentators explained. \"That is him just mentally breaking him, saying I'm going to utterly dominate you in this one on one.\" And dominate s1imple did. Na'Vi would go on to secure the win over Team Liquid and eventually claim first place and a cool $125,000 cash prize thanks in part to s1mple's ability to make amazing clutch plays. Even if you don't play CS:GO, I absolutely recommend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/782815106593792000\"> watching </a> some of the highlights from this weekend that can be found on the official ESL CS:GO Twitter account. S1mple also made another clutch play when he went <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/782790893497483265\"> toe-to-toe </a> with four members of Virtus.pro using only a Desert Eagle. The CS:GO community has also put together some amazing videos following the tournament, including this highlight reel by YouTuber 'Virre CSGO' which captures all of the excitement of the weekend. ",

        "contents": "I started playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive when it was in open beta. It was a scary time for a Counter-Strike nerd like me. I had played CS 1.6 (the version before Counter-Strike: Source and Global Offensive) since early 2005. In some ways it felt like the end times. My beloved game that had kept me sane through my years in school was slowly but surely dying. After a few months of complaining about the details that separated CS:GO from 1.6 (why would they have firebombs in a Counter-Strike game, I cried) a friend of mine suggested that we attend the upcoming Dreamhack Winter event in J nk ping, Sweden. I had never been to a LAN of that size before so I accepted and we put together a team consisting of friends from the 1.6 days, as well as a friend named John that had never played CS before. At all. If my memory serves me right it was about four months until the event when we started to practice. We had just learned that the bring your own computer tournament was going to serve as a qualifier for a main event that happened to be the first-ever CS:GO Major. After a few nights I must admit that I was ready to give up. John was terrible. A nice guy, but he just couldn t play the game. Then something changed. After a couple of weeks I noticed that John had started to hit his shots, and that he understood the basics of teamplay and positioning. I went to his Steam profile and noticed that he averaged just under ten hours (!) per day. With a few days left we decided to meet up at a friend s house closer to J nk ping to get some LAN hours under our belt before the tournament. We had so much fun, both in-game and out. It really felt like we were making progress each day. When we finally got to the venue and set up our computers I started to get nervous. Was this a mistake? I mean we re pretty good, but not that good, right? We signed up for the tournament, went over the strategies in our playbook one last time and then later that same evening it was go time. Our first game was on the map Inferno. We won that game 16-0. Maybe we d make it out of the groups after all? Fast forward to the next game. We were going to face a British team that had travelled all the way to Sweden for this event. Obviously, they meant business. This time the game was going to be played on Mirage, our strongest map at the time. In the first round we decided to go for a B-split. We took control over mid and then pressured their defenses from two sides. My teammates racked up a few quick kills and we found ourselves in a 5-versus-1 situation. I hid inside the kitchen and managed to remain unseen until the lone counter-terrorist had passed by me. A second later I had drawn my knife, secured the round and humiliated him at the same time. At that moment I felt like a superstar. I was on top of the world. However, that feeling wouldn t last for long as that was the only round we won in that game. 1-16 was the final score and our dream was crushed. After yet another game we finished second to last in our group and our run in the tournament came to an abrupt end. That weekend we watched the Major, and when it was time for the grand final you could really feel the hype. The world s best team NiP was going to play the underdogs, Fnatic. A few rounds into the game the crowd started to chant Friberg! Friberg! Friberg! after some great rounds from NiP s Adam friberg Friberg. At that moment I knew that this <em>wasn t</em> the end times. This was the beginning. That s part of the beauty of Counter-Strike: it never truly dies, even if it's come close at times. Then we got to see the biggest upset in the game s short history up to that point, as Fnatic won the title. What is CS:GO, really? You might wonder why I told you that story about our somewhat na ve attempt to qualify for the first Major tournament. For me that s the core of what CS:GO is: it s competition at its purest. You don t have any special abilities. No silly magic, no heat seeking missiles, no nothing. You have a basic arsenal of weapons at your disposal. Apart from that it s just you and your teammates. Your objective is to plant a bomb at one of two bomb sites and make sure the counter-terrorists can t defuse it before it goes off 40 seconds later. If you re on the other side your objective is to prevent the terrorists from doing so. What truly makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive unique is the economic system. It s a round based game and in the first round you start with $800 and a basic pistol. That money is just enough for you to get body armor, some grenades or a better pistol. You have to choose wisely. If you win a round you get more money for the next one. At the same time you get bonus cash for consecutive losses. This system adds another layer of strategy to the game. Sometimes you re better off not buying anything at all. Even if that means that you re likely to lose that round it also means you have more money left for future rounds and that ll increase your chances of winning a round and swing the momentum your way. The simple graphics and clean textures make players easy to spot. It s not like in Battlefield where you can hide in a bush and kill people without getting seen. Because of how accurate the first few bullets are with most weapons, the connection between your hand movements and what happens on the screen is extreme. It s a lot like a hockey player and his stick: easy to learn but takes a lifetime to master. Aside from your physical dexterity, CS:GO will push your mental capabilities to the test. The number of different strategies you can employ is so great that it s probably close to infinite. I d go so far as to say that CS:GO doesn t have a skill ceiling. It s always possible to get better. What do you need?&#xA0; You need a Steam account and a copy of the game. There are no hidden fees. No DLCs you have to pay for. If you buy the game you gain access to all the content you need to play. There are however weapon skins that you can buy either from other players through the Steam market or by buying keys to open crates that you get from playing. These skins are entirely optional and you gain no advantage whatsoever by doing so. Apart from looking cool and a potential confidence boost if you re the kind of person that enjoys wearing the fanciest clothes or driving flashy cars. You ll also need time. Like I mentioned earlier, it s easy to learn how to play CS:GO, but it s impossible to fully master. If your goal is to improve you ll have to put in a lot of work. Read guides, watch professionals play and above all else: practice a lot! If you on the other hand want to have fun and play a game every now and then all you need is a little over an hour to spare, and that s really stretching it. Most games end <em>way</em> before the 60 minute mark. It s also helpful if you re friendly towards teammates and opponents: sadly, there are a lot of people who aren t. Unless you ve played competitive games online in the past you re likely to encounter more obnoxious people in CS:GO than you ve ever had the bad fortune to meet before. Luckily, you have the option to mute people. Finally I recommend you to get a headset with a microphone. Being able to hear footsteps around you is a big part of the game and being able to use voice chat to communicate enemy positions to your teammates is equally important. Resources for beginners&#xA0; <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Counter-Strike%3A%20Global%20Offensive\"> Twitch </a>'s CS:GO section is an amazing way to find your favorite players and watch them play the game. Try to learn from them. Why did they position themselves like that, in that situation? There are also an almost infinite number of useful videos on YouTube. Search for things like spray control, flashbangs and smokes. Learn from the more experienced players. Once you ve picked up the basics you might want to watch pro matches. Not only will they help you improve faster but they re also a great source of entertainment. Especially once you get to know the players and teams. Over at <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"> HLTV.org </a> they have detailed schedules where you can find information on when teams are playing. They also provide links to the match streams. Check it out! Finally, I d also like to recommend the range CS:GO guides I ve written for PC Gamer over the last year. You ll find some neat tricks to use on different maps, how to use grenades and even guides for how to play different roles on a team. <strong>All of these the guides can be found below.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> Inferno Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> Cache Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> Cache Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> Overpass Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> Cobblestone Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> Train Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> Train Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> Mirage Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> Dust2 Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> Support role guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> Entry fragger role guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> Lurker role guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> AWPer role guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-leader-guide/\"> Team leader guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-smg-guide/\"> SMGs guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/master-sniper-rifles-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> Sniper rifles guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-assault-rifle-guide/\"> Assault rifles guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-pistol-guide/\"> Pistols guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-worst-weapons/\"> Worst weapons guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-he-grenade-molotov-firebomb-guide/\"> HE grenades and firebombs guide </a> ",

The 76ers said the two outfits will be merged under the Team Dignitas name, and will field teams in League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, and Smite. The 76ers and its ownership group, which holds other pro sports teams including the New Jersey Devils of the NHL and the English Premier League team Crystal Palace FC, will directly manage the day-to-day operations of the newly-unified Team Dignitas, sharing best practices in sponsorship, sales, branding, digital marketing, merchandising, publicity and more, the team said. Michael O'Dell, formerly the managing director of the pre-merged Dignitas, will assume the role of president of the new team, while former Apex owner Michael Slan will step in as vice-president and general manager. Greg Richardson of Rumble Entertainment will serve as chairman. The attractiveness of this deal is as much about the people as it is the opportunity, Philadelphia 76ers CEO Scott O Neil said. Bringing together gaming industry luminaries including Greg Richardson, Michael O Dell and David and Michael Slan puts us on track to build the most respected and dominant franchise in the esports space, spur fan engagement, and reimagine corporate sponsorship to create a vibrant, global e-arena where the greatest players in the world aspire to compete. The 76ers aren't the first pro sports organization to get involved in esports: German soccer team Schalke picked up LoL team Elements <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-16-german-football-team-schalke-now-has-a-league-of-legends-team\">earlier this year</a>, and Premier League clubs West Ham and Manchester City have their own <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/manchester-city-fc-signs-its-first-esports-player/\">pro FIFA players</a>. But in terms of scope, and also of visibility in the North American makret, this easily outstrips them all, and it puts Team Dignitas and the 76ers in a uniquely powerful and privileged position. I expect other teams will follow their lead. ",

        "contents": "<a target=\"_blank\"> WoW fan art by Liang Xing. </a> Micah Whipple didn t believe in Real ID. It was unveiled in 2010 as a new social initiative in the Blizzard forums, effectively forcing players to register their real names instead of Battle.net aliases to cut down on the witch hunts and treachery that so often define anonymous, online public spaces. Whipple thought the policy would be unsustainable and unenforceable, but as a World of Warcraft community manager it was his job to go to bat for it. The CM role is simple: be a plebeian, embed yourself in the community, serve as liaison between publisher and community, and most importantly, stay optimistic. What that really means: when the players got angry, Whipple was paid to run into burning buildings. Sometimes he was a firefighter, and sometimes he was a meatshield. As a Blizzard fan, but also a staunch defender of a company I loved working for, I defended the proposal by giving people my real name as proof it wasn t going to be a big deal. My name was information that was freely available, so it seemed like a non-issue, says Whipple. But as one could expect I became a target for the whole thing and received a lot of death threats, threats of sending stuff to my house, releasing whatever info they could find. All the kind of stuff we re all pretty used to happening these days, but back then was not really something we were readily exposed to. Whipple was doing his best to be a good employee and taking one for the team over an idea he didn t necessarily believe in. It s part of the job description. Developers behind the scenes cook up controversial mechanics or balance changes, and the community managers field the fallout. Most of the time he was able to find relief taking smoke breaks with his co-workers to scoff at the eternal scorn (generally the people in the department averaged a half-pack a day). All it takes is one patch, or dubious nerf, or broken mechanic for a passionate player base to turn the forums into a rebel state. Sometimes community managers are firefighters, and sometimes they're meatshields. Most bombshells that drop are known beforehand since they tend to come from outward announcements, but things like bad launches or service issues are sometimes harder to predict and will result in late nights and weekend coverage, says Whipple. If you ve done what you can do, and the only thing left is to ensure the feedback keeps making its way to the developers, it s usually not going to add a lot of value to continue to agonize over people s anger or continue engaging and repeating yourself. The trap you have to work hard to avoid is considering it solved, and disengaging from it entirely. Those things can smolder and burn for a long time if they re not put out decisively enough. As violent as it was, the Real ID pushback was managed. But at a price. Real ID was one of the more painful experiences in his life. I think actually woke me up a bit, and made me realize my employment with any company is a partnership, and not any kind of debt or life-oath that I need to repay, he says. requires a huge amount of empathy, so of course if you re reading negativity day in and day out it s difficult not to take at least some of that with you, continues Whipple. With enough experience you can kind of catch it before it gets bad and take a step back, but more than a couple times I found myself in really dark depressive states for quite a while just due to, essentially, surrounding myself for eight hours a day with people s hate. Pile on top of that just all the standard stuff that s going on in life, and it can get very real very quickly. Looking back, and having a better understanding of what depression actually looks and feels like, it s probably something I should ve sought professional help for. <a target=\"_blank\"> </a> Those controversies seldom deserve the antipathy they inspire. When Blizzard introduced a subpar card for the Priest class in Hearthstone, lead designer (and public face of the game) Ben Brode was forced to take to YouTube <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone-lead-designer-explains-why-new-priest-card-is-so-bad/\"> for an apology tour </a>. There was a months-long political panic centered on a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-victory-pose-cut-after-fan-complains-that-its-over-sexualized/\"> Tracer victory pose </a>. There are legitimate reasons to be angry about videogames, but the righteous fury we re used to usually looks extreme after a controversy blows over. In the moment, when a community is on fire, part of the citizenship is going to pour on gasoline, and it s the community managers who get burned. Fundamentally I can at least understand what might lead to someone to be pissed off at a six percent changed to a five percent, I found myself resenting and dismissing people more and more that just didn t seem to have anything of constructive value to say, Whipple says. Maintaining optimism seems like a nearly impossible part of the job, but great community managers always find a way to care, no matter how bad it gets. Staying invested Alex Leary has worked as a community manager for over a decade. He says one of the biggest issues he faced professionally was during his stint on Everquest after the Shadows of Luclin expansion. Essentially every 12 to 24 hours servers would shut down randomly, immediately smiting anyone who happened to be online. Everquest was a hardcore game. If the server crashes while you re fighting monsters you re gonna come back dead, and you re going to lose experience by dying. It was like someone reaching through the screen and poking every player in the eye, says Leary. Bad server code isn t really a storm you can prepare for. The average community manager doesn t have the correct skillset to decipher a faulty network much less explain it to the masses but that s the deal. Nobody else is going under the bus. It's you, every time. After years of being held personally accountable for every mistake, you think it d be easy to grow numb. According to Leary, that s one of the biggest mistakes you can make. You have to stay tapped-in, he says. If you can t keep that in balance and you start tuning out and ignoring customers you want to make people feel listened to. You want to empower those advocates, those hardcore players who will then turn around at 3am when you re not on the forums and have your back. That s how you keep the pitchforks away. <a target=\"_blank\"> </a> Still, Leary is probably painting a more idyllic picture of what goes on in your average video game forum. Anger incited by server crashes is understandable, but a lot of dust-ups center on far more subjective things like the AWP s damage output (<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/487870763313353027/\"> one shot to the body to kill? Really? How am I supposed to counter that? </a>,) or Hanzo s dodgy hitbox (<a href=\"http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20749364989\"> fix your game Blizzard! </a>). Most of the time the community doesn t have access to the hard data, and naturally, a lot of them don t know what they re talking about. From a very high customer service level I believe everyone s complaint is legitimate, because it s legitimate to them. That said, most people are wrong most of the time about most things, says Whipple. There are a lot of cognitive biases that lead to the different types of online community interactions and herd behaviors, and one of the greatest challenges and greatest powers is learning how to counter them. The biggest challenge, and one that I think mostly goes without a good solution, is that a fairly large contingency of any large community believes they re smart and right most or all of the time. And the infuriating thing (to me) is that a lot of times people believe they re right because someone else said it, and they read it or heard it somewhere. That s the core paradox of being a community manager. You re locked in a permanent debate. You might enlighten a few, but there s an endless stream of righteous complaints waiting in the wings. Online discussions are some of the biggest victims of a lack of curiosity, of creativity, and of an overwhelming belief in personal superiority over others. And it s not just a couple people being pigheaded. Negativity is an increasingly popular way to perceive and communicate with the outside world, says Whipple. But maybe that s why community management is so vital. The job is to resist cynicism and remind the commonwealth why they fell in love with the game in the first place. They may never stem the tide, but the community managers who can weather the storm sometimes build lifelong connections. <a target=\"_blank\"> Dark Age of Camelot, via Gamercrash.com. </a> When it&apos;s worth it Sanya Weathers was hired off an EverQuest rant site to serve as the CM for an upstart MMO called Dark Age of Camelot. She was paid very, very little money, but dived into the gig headfirst. I am not sure if I m the first in the games industry to treat this job like relationship building, but I was at least in the first wave, she says. I learned very quickly that my biggest weakness and my biggest strength was missing the forest for the trees. That is the main thing that causes anger and frustration for players, continues Weathers. What sounds like constant moaning is actually a hundred different complaints when you zoom in closer, and almost all of the issues can be handled by giving more information, by including people in the bigger picture. So I don't get numb to it, because I'm right there in the trees with my players. I can then take that feeling and use my privileged access to get the whole story and share it. Weathers calls herself incredibly lucky. She s never had to deal with a truly destabilizing controversy. Small ones, though? Sure. There was the time a typo in a class ability spreadsheet turned a 0.05 percent boost into a 50 percent boost, or how, after months of conspiracy theories from players, it was finally discovered that a mechanical error was causing charisma to have a measurable weight on all combat rolls. She s also dealt with some sizable customer service issues, in her words a corrupt developer or a grossly-biased , which had to be removed. It was in those moments where Weathers thrived. It's funny, things like that which actually are big and I've lived through too many for my taste don't register as big with a community that has had proper communication, she says. No, what registers as big is when a player is caught cheating, and insists he wasn't cheating, and suddenly a routine CS matter is now this psychotic Rorschach test, this net-wide referendum on whether or not the company has earned the trust of the customer. But that's where I earn my paycheck. Not by how I react in the moment, but whether or not I was able to communicate my company's integrity before the trouble hits. I earn my paycheck not by how I react in the moment, but whether I was able to communicate my company's integrity before the trouble hits. Sanya Weathers Weathers treats community management like a batting cage in the park. The balls keep coming, she keeps swinging until the machine runs out. Then you have the shakes and pee yourself, whatever, while it s going, you keep going. Years later, long after that game closed and its developer Mythic Entertainment was absorbed into the greater EA hierarchy, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CamelotUnchained/comments/190fgf/official_request_for_sanya_weathers/\"> her prodigal return is beseeched in a post </a> on the subreddit for the Kickstarter-funded revival Camelot Unchained. I know it's way off and I know she is already employed but I will be damned if I don't say anything. That woman was amazing at connecting with the community and keeping everyone posted, it reads. If one of your stretch goals is to hire her you would get a lot more money... just saying. None of these people have left the business. Whipple works as a content manager at NCSoft now, but he stayed on Blizzard's community team till 2015 five long years after the community's worst uncovered his home address during the Real ID fiasco. Leary started his career as an EverQuest game master, and has since CM d in City of Heroes, Pocket Legends, and currently The Pokemon Trading Card Game. Putting out those fires is exhausting, but it must also be a little bit rewarding for them to stick with it. <a target=\"_blank\"> Blizzard's community gathers at BlizzCon, via Nerdist.com. </a> All of my jobs come from people who have seen community management in action and realize how tremendously it amplifies their work and how it builds momentum and goodwill and word of mouth, says Weathers. Good community, one that is based on human exchanges and not on collecting likes like a squirrel hoarding acorns, is magical. Likes are nice, but all they represent is potential potential for action. Not a goal in and of itself. A good CM knows the player has already bought the game and doesn't need to be sold anything. A good CM genuinely cares if the players are having a good experience. A good CM builds real relationships, based on give and take, with players, the press, and the people who are both. Community management can often feel static. The outrage is cyclical. No matter how many minds you change or egos you soften, there s always another flare-up around the corner. But if you do the job right, those bonds can last forever. Weathers listened, and sympathized, and returned the next day. The bellyaching is in the past, and what's left is a lot of appreciation for someone who was always there. Community managers wear a lot of hats. They re social media arbiters, PR reps, and occasionally meat shields. But more than anything else, they re paid to believe the angry mob is an illusion, and that civility is only a good conversation away. ",

Although it's unclear at this stage which game they were leveraging, two British men have now been charged with offences under the UK Gambling Act. As reported by the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37385555\">BBC</a>, both Dylan Rigby and Craig Douglas have been charged with promoting lottery and advertising unlawful gambling, while Douglas has also been charged with inviting children to gamble. These prosecutions are thought to be the first involving betting on videogames. The UK s Gambling Commission has been looking into the rise of video game gambling over the past few months, writes the BBC, with the regulatory body now issuing warning to parents of potential underage victims. Both men accused appeared in Birmingham Magistrates Court earlier today, however the case has been adjourned to October 14. It has been estimated that the global market in betting on video games is worth as much as 4 billion, reads the report.

However, <a href=\"http://www.vac-ban.com/\">vac-ban.com</a> indicates that fewer than 4000 CS:GO players were banned that day, while the balance, according to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/52rjsl/thanks_valve_for_finally_banning_cheaters_out_of/\">this thread</a>, went to Dota 2 players. SteamDB doesn't break down VAC ban numbers by game so it's impossible to verify without confirmation from Valve, which I would guess will not be forthcoming. Even so, it seems very likely that this was a bad day for CS:GO <em>and</em> Dota 2 cheaters. <strong>Original story:</strong> Today was not a good day to be a cheater. According to a story by <a href=\"http://steamed.kotaku.com/thousands-of-cheaters-reportedly-banned-from-counter-st-1786640171\">Kotaku</a>, more than 11,000 people have been banned by the Valve Anti-Cheat system for breaking the rules, one of the largest spikes of VAC activity this year. Valve Anti-Cheat is continually banning players, but in this case it appears that the system has become able to detect previously untouchable cheats. The Kotaku report includes an image of banned dickheads sobbing into the empty space where their knife collections once rested (that quote is just too good not to use). The Steam inventories of banned players are essentially frozen: they cannot trade or sell items from their inventory for that game. There's also an indirect acknowledgment from a large cheat provider in this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/52mj1m/untrusted_ban_wave/\">CSGO subreddit thread</a> that his software isn't currently performing as it should. The thread also contains messages about people with previously good cheats ie, which VAC could not detect who have suddenly found themselves locked out. The tricky bit about this sort of thing is that these ban waves very rarely come with explainers that break down how and why a particular round of bans was implemented (although I guess the 'why' part of it is fairly self-evident), or even to confirm that something out of the ordinary has happened at all. But the war against cheating in online games is an ongoing one, and so it only makes sense that, as systems improve, there will be these sudden upticks in activity as Valve 'cracks a code' somewhere and trips people up. Of course, the opposite holds true, too: players determined to cheat will come up with new ways to do so, and around and around it goes. I've emailed Valve for more information about the sudden uptick in bans, and I'll update this post if and when I receive a reply. ",

This is the EU qualifier for the next WCA. The previous one was, by all accounts, a gigantic shambles that people only forgot about because the Shanghai Major was a higher profile shambles.

        "contents": "Valve imposed a new rule for Valve-sponsored <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">CS:GO</a> events yesterday that <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-coaches-banned-from-helping-teams-during-competitive-matches/\">forbids coaches from interacting with players</a> while matches are underway: They may now talk to players only during pregame warm-ups, timeouts, and at halftime. The problem, Valve explained, is that unrestricted access to teams during matches effectively makes coaches a sixth player, and since the goal of our events is to identify the best five-player CS teams that exhibit the best combination of all CS skills, the current participation of coaches in the game is not compatible with that goal. Not everyone agrees with Valve's assessment of the situation, however. A number of analysts and commentators took to Twitter to express displeasure with the new rule, some saying it's simply unnecessary and others claiming that it's outright damaging to the game. New coaching rule is pathetic. Valve was never good at pushing CS:GO forward, but why send it rolling back downhill any further?<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lurppis_/status/765949917189771264\">August 17, 2016</a> It's quite telling that there's not one pro player, journalist, commentator or coach that agree with this new coaching rule.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/766026349039513600\">August 17, 2016</a> The idea that coaches allow teams to be made of 5 brainless aimers is also dumb, and if that's your opinion it's why you're not good at CS<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnFireMoses/status/766411442912370688\">August 18, 2016</a> Let the rest of us continue to grow your mismanaged game for you.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SelflessRyu/status/765946465294422016\">August 17, 2016</a> Nonetheless, Valve seems determined to stick with the change. The ruling won't force the change upon all tournaments, but it will affect the Majors, which as you might expect are the largest tournaments in CS:GO. Valve <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-all-major-csgo-tournaments-will-be-1-million/\" target=\"_blank\">began awarding $1 million</a> in prize money for each major tournament this year. Valve clarified its position on the ruling in a <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/coaching/\">follow-up statement</a> in which it said that it has spoken with pro teams about their coaches at past Majors, and had been assured that their focus was \"on activities traditionally associated with coaching, such as preparation, support, opponent study, etc. We were always open with them about our opinion that distributing the work of 5 players (e.g. keeping track of the economy, calling plays and mid-round calls, and general situational awareness) across 6 people was not in line with our goals, one of which was to make it possible for new teams to emerge and compete at the highest levels. We had no concerns with the other coaching responsibilities and at the time any potential harm was hypothetical, the statement says. Since then it has become apparent that teams are, in fact, transitioning away from fielding players that have a wider breadth of skills and instead relying on coaches to handle some of that work. Ironically, what prompted the new rule was an email from a team coach, sent to an event organizer and forwarded to Valve, seeking a greater level of access to the players during matches. The forwarded email made it clear that despite the conversations we had with them, teams were further investing in coaching in a way that was contrary to the goals of the Majors and the concerns we had expressed. It was important to make a decision before teams further invested in coach IGLs and we decided to rein in the role of coaching in the next Major to exclude player responsibilities, Valve wrote. We understand that there will be some short term disruption for teams that have made an investment in coach IGLs , it concluded. However, we intend the Majors and Minors to be events that can be won by any team of 5 players that demonstrate excellence in all skills of CS and this adjustment is intended to ensure that this remains true. Short term disruption may be understating things somewhat: As <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/18428-valve-to-limit-coach-communication\">HLTV</a> pointed out, a number of high-profile teams including Natus Vincere, NiP, Liquid, mousesports, and FaZe make use of coaches, and losing access to them so suddenly is bound to have an impact on their performance. It won't take long to find out just how much, and which teams are best able to overcome it: ESL has adopted the rule as well, meaning that the first CSGO Major to operate under this new rule will be <a href=\"http://en.esl-one.com/csgo/newyork-2016/\">ESL One New York</a>, which runs over the weekend of October 1-2.

        "contents": "Inferno has always been one of the most iconic maps in Counter-Strike, both in 1.6 and Global Offensive. Many of the biggest tournament finals have ended on the map, along with some of the most memorable plays of all time. Almost every pro team knows exactly how to play it, and as a result Inferno matches were often the closest and most unpredictable. Earlier this year, Valve dropped the bombshell that Inferno was to be removed from the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive active duty map pool and replaced by an updated version of Nuke. This change would have a major effect on the pro scene, as what felt like an entirely new map was replacing one of the staples of pro CS:GO. Teams would have to adapt quickly and devise new strategies for Nuke while forgetting everything they knew about Inferno. A few months after the switch, teams have started to play Nuke more and more, with mixed results. Many of the top squads are comfortable on the map, whereas others are still banning it out. It has certainly shaken up the pro scene, but it seems like the top players in the world can t quite agree if this was a good change or not. I m definitely not a fan of the new Nuke, says Robin \"flusha\" R nnquist, a former member of Fnatic, who were considered to be one of the best teams in the history of CS:GO. We played it a few times and we tried to get better at it and so on, but it's such a chaotic map, you don't know how well you can actually play it. There is just too many things to hold and the timings, if you have the wrong timing you are going to die. It s just a bad map. This opinion seemed to be shared by many pro players when the switch first happened, as many players were critical of the map on social media and the majority of teams banned out the new Nuke in any pro matches. However, one team that seemed to be happy about the change was Ninjas in Pyjamas, who were one of the best teams on the old version of Nuke. We are big fans of Nuke, says Adam \"friberg\" Friberg from NiP. We played Nuke a lot before it was removed and it was probably our go to map. We are very excited to have it back, but we probably need more time to be the best on it. The original version of Nuke was a very divisive map. Some teams, such as NiP, would always pick it, while others would avoid it like the plague. This new version seems to have a similar reputation, but even players who were considered to be some of the best in the world on the original version are still not sold on new Nuke, and preferred the Inferno map that it replaced. I was not a fan when they removed Nuke originally, I think people who didn't play Nuke back then didn't know how to play it properly, says Finn \"karrigan\" Andersen, captain of Astralis. As for taking out Inferno, I started to like it more and more. In the beginning it was very Counter-Terrorist sided but they made a lot of changes, especially with the new round time, to make it better. I feel sad that they removed it, especially switching it with a Nuke that I don't think is ready yet. What I worry about the most is that Nuke gets updated all the time, and they are making changes all the time on the map. So if I invest time now I am concerned that there will be a big update because something happened that Valve didn't like. Of course removing Inferno was always going to annoy some people, especially the teams that played the map a lot. But looking at the competitive map pool there aren't all that many other options to take out, as the maps are all pretty settled outside of Nuke. Interestingly it was captain of the current world champions, SK Gaming, who offered up some alternatives that could have been replaced by Nuke. SK Gaming's FalleN. Photo credit: ECS. I don't think Inferno should be gone to be honest, says Gabriel \"FalleN\" Toledo. If I could remove one map it would be Cobblestone and maybe Dust II, but Dust II is a map that everyone knows CS for, so it is pretty difficult to remove it. But Cobblestone is pretty unbalanced right now. Ultimately it s not up to me, so we will be practising Nuke and we hope to make it a good map for us. Again it was Ninjas in Pyjamas who provided a vastly different opinion on this matter. Team coach and Counter Strike 1.6 legend Bj rn \"THREAT\" Pers gave his thoughts on Inferno s removal. Nuke is still way better than Inferno, which was the worst map in the map pool, says THREAT. It was the least tactical map and the most random map, because you cannot gain any information and you just have to guess. I didn't like that aspect at all. Regardless of the players opinions on the Nuke and Inferno switch, they will have to get used to playing the new version of Nuke. Having a map that you just cannot play gives a team a serious disadvantage at the pro level. However from the pros that we have spoken to it certainly seems that this may not have been the right time to make the switch. There are still a lot of issues with Nuke, which really need to be sorted out quickly, while the classic Inferno map remains one of the best CS:GO maps of all time. What the future holds for these two maps is unclear, but right now it seems that Valve may have acted too hastily on this one. ",

        "contents": "Deemed to give certain teams greater advantage over others, Valve has introduced new rules which limit coach communication during Valve-sponsored esports matches. Although still permitted to converse with players during pre-game warm ups, 30-second timeouts, and during halftime, the new rules which have been endorsed by the ESL state coaches are now banned from interacting with their teams when actual rounds are underway. Posted by <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/18428-valve-to-limit-coach-communication\">HLTV</a>, the email signed by Valve s Ido Magal reads as follows: <em>\"With unrestricted communication with their players, coaches can currently function as a sixth player, and not solely as a source of guidance or training.

        "contents": "Photo credit: ESL In what feels like the end of an era, <a href=\"http://www.fnatic.com/content/96730\"> Swedish side Fnatic have announced a huge change to their CS:GO roster </a>, releasing three players, JW, flusha and KRIMZ from their lineup. While some teams in CS are known for regular changes, there are also the stalwarts, NiP, Virtus Pro and Fnatic, who have maintained (roughly) the same core team for many years. It therefore holds significant weight when these mighty bastions finally crumble. Rather than fully disband, the three players will be moving to join their former teammate, pronax, in team GODSENT, <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sp0n0q\"> of which they will become co-owners and shareholders </a>. This surprise announcement (released just fifteen minutes before GODSENT were scheduled to play a match) follows in the footsteps of Danish side Astralis, who left the TeamSoloMid organisation to form their own. To fill the void left behind, Fnatic have welcomed GODSENT players twist and Lekr0, both Swedish players of talent. The final slot has been taken by wenton, who will be looking to prove himself after Fnatic s lacklustre performance during his time substituting olofmeister. New opportunities It would be hard for onlookers not to see this change as a downgrade for Fnatic, given that they re losing two of their most experienced players in the form of JW and flusha. Both of these players were present at every Major victory during Fnatic s reign. However, the acquisition of GODSENT players gives Fnatic a real chance to revitalise themselves. Twist should acclimatise quickly, holding previous experience with olof and dennis under LGB. Lekr0, fairly new to the upper echelons of competition, could offer a fresh perspective and will be one to watch closely as he establishes himself in the coming months. The swap to GODSENT represents a return to old ways for JW and Flusha, who competed with both pronax and znajder under the Fnatic banner back in 2013. Departing messages from each player hint at ideological differences within the team. This combined with the move to become co-owners of GODSENT indicates that the players rather than the organisation may have been behind the split. Photo credit: ESL Perhaps the most surprising change comes in the separation of olofmeister and KRIMZ, who were renowned as one of CS:GO s most efficient and dangerous pairings. The question for GODSENT will therefore be who can provide the star-player performance in their lineup. Having struggled to perform during olof s downtime, it will be up to KRIMZ to excel once more without his teammate to rely on. In addition, there s a real chance that the move to GODSENT will see JW return to primary AWPing, an opportunity for him to reassert himself through the quick-firing, aggressive play that brought him to fame in the first place. Going down in history Fnatic s core of olof, KRIMZ, flusha and JW will surely be remembered as one of the strongest forces in Global Offensive s history, producing a staggering display of dominance throughout 2014-15. In 2015 alone, Fnatic won no less than five $100,000 prize tournaments, including both Katowice and Cologne Majors. Few beyond NiP can rival their past success and it may be some time before we see another side in charge for so long. In contrast to NiP s slow decline, Fnatic ran into trouble when olofmeister suffered from significant wrist problems and was forced to take a break for his own health in April. Competing with wenton as a substitute, the swedes seemed to fall into disarray, never quite recovering even upon olof s return. Despite this, Fnatic hold a superb legacy in CS and their success will likely be remembered for years to come. ",

        "contents": "Image credit: duncasaurus_ on Reddit. Skins are a big deal in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Since launching in the <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2013/08/7425/\"> Arms Deal update </a> in August 2013, gun paint has become as much a part of Counter-Strike culture as defusing bombs and rescuing hostages. For most of us, a weapon 'finish' or skin is a fun way to liven up your arsenal a reward system within an already rewarding FPS. But skins are also a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"> contentious business </a> and, more importantly, a symbol of a player's status. And when it comes to showing off, there's no gun more likely to drive others green with envy than the M4A4 Howl the closest thing Counter-Strike has to a legendary gun. The M4A4 Howl stands alone when it comes to gun finishes in Counter-Strike. Though you ll occasionally see other guns and knives listed at a higher price, the <a href=\"https://csgostash.com/skin/355/M4A4-Howl\"> StatTrak M4A4 Howl (Factory New) </a> is uniquely valuable. The rarity of the Howl doesn't come from its gorgeous red striping and the fiery creature emblazoned along the left side of the receiver, but rather from the story of theft, DMCA takedowns, and banned players that made it famous. It could've just vanished from the game forever, but Valve made it a legend. Image credit: TH3X on Steam. It&apos;s just skin The story of the Howl traces all the way back to 2010, when Valve made <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/team-fortress-2-now-selling-items-for-real-money-massive-update-just-launched/\"> huge changes </a> to one of its most popular games, Team Fortress 2, that introduced a microtransaction economy called the Mann Co. store. At the time, no one could foresee how this move would impact just about every Valve game as players began trading, crafting, and buying a variety of items using Team Fortress 2's virtual marketplace. Only a year later, Valve expanded on the system by creating <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/team-fortress-2-manniversary-update-adds-steam-workshop-new-hats-new-map-item-trials/\"> the Steam Workshop </a>, where modders and artists from the community were invited to submit their designs to be used and voted on by other players. If those designs were especially popular, Valve would officially include them in updates to Team Fortress 2. It could've just vanished from the game forever, but Valve made it a legend. In the two years that followed, the Steam Workshop began creeping its way into other games like Dota 2 and Skyrim, providing a unified marketplace for user-generated content and, for Valve's games, creating a birthing ground for one of the most complex microtransaction economies in all of gaming. It wasn't until 2013 that the Workshop found its way to CS:GO for players to design and share new maps and game modes. At the time Counter-Strike was still a divided community, with many players choosing to stick with the two previous iterations Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike 1.6. It was only after Valve released the Arms Deal update finally letting players purchase and trade custom skins for their weapons that <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-400-virtual-knives-saved-counter-strike/\"> CS:GO transformed into the multiplayer and esports phenomenon </a> that it is <a href=\"http://steamcharts.com/app/730#All\"> today </a>. Image credit: Nitor_cs on Reddit. In 2014, the marketplace for skins was exploding with players routinely trading rare knives and gun finishes for hundreds of dollars. Artists, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/news/15614/\"> inspired by the wads of cash </a> modders were making if Valve chose their designs to be sold in their games, began flooding the CS:GO Workshop with their ideas for the next hot skin that would have players in a frenzy but not all of those ideas were original. On March 30, 2014, a skin and a sticker were uploaded to the workshop under the title 'Howling Dawn' by Steam users Auzzii and sic. The skin, which would go on to earn more than 4,500 positive ratings, was supposedly the original work of Auzzii. In the description he wrote, \"I wanted to make an intresting illustration, so I created this. It originated from a picture of my dog, it's kind of taking the out of him in a way as he's the complete opisite to the wolf.\" A month later that skin and sticker were officially added to CS:GO as part of the <a href=\"http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Huntsman_Weapon_Case\"> Huntsman collection </a> because of their popularity among the Workshop community. These collections would drop special cases in-game that players could purchase keys to open and earn one of the skins contained within. Those that were lucky opened up a case to find a flashy new M4A4 Howl. CanisAlbus's original artwork that Auzzii stole. Crime and punishment&#xA0; While the Arms Deal update that brought skins to CS:GO played heavily on themes of illegal black market trading, it was never intended to facilitate actual theft. But in June of 2014, Deviantart user CanisAlbus discovered that's exactly what had happened the popular Howl skin wasn't inspired by Auzzii's dog, it was a shameless copy of his own artwork. \"Someone has stolen one of my artworks to make a custom skin for a gun in a game called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,\" CanisAlbus <a href=\"http://canisalbus.deviantart.com/journal/Art-theft-in-Steam-Counter-Strike-459394075\"> wrote in his Deviantart blog </a>. \"I'm just letting you know(sic) that I did design this piece, but I didn't upload the items to the stream marketplace and the spineless worm who submitted it didn't have my permission to do so. However, I have reported both copyright infringements and I'm hoping that the items will be removed soon.\" As CS:GO continued to become more popular, the price of a Howl skin skyrocketed. Days later, Valve announced that they had received a DMCA takedown notice regarding the use of CanisAlbus's artwork without permission and responded. \"When we launched the CS:GO Items Workshop, our goal was to provide artists with a space to share their creative ideas,\" Valve <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/games/CSGO/announcements/detail/1751086783896069815\"> wrote in a blog to the community </a>. \"By design, the Items Workshop has very low friction for artists to submit their work new contributions do not require Valve review or approval.\" They do however, require that modders sign a <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoplegalagreement/?appid=730\"> legal agreement </a> before uploading their creations. The community didn't react kindly. In a Reddit thread <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/27mgly/m4a4_howl_stickers_art_theft_in_the_steam_workshop/\"> one user wrote </a>, \" took me a damn week to finish the artwork for my skin, disregarding the time spent modifying the pattern to fit the gun properly. Auzzii is a tool for doing this, and honestly I'm pretty surprised it hasn't come up sooner.\" A comparison of the old Howl (left) and the new (right). Click the arrows to enlarge. Howl, the Howling Dawn sticker, and the five other guns from the Huntsman collection that sic was involved in making were removed from the weapon cases though they would still remain in player's inventories. In the case of Howl and its sticker, both were given original redesigns by the CS:GO team to reflect their original aesthetic but avoid infringing CanisAlbus's copyright. For sic, this revelation of theft was a slap in the face. He had been making CS:GO skins for months, and compared to first-time contributor Auzzii, stood to lose a lot more. In an update to the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140608212333/http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243992657\"> Howling Dawn's original Workshop page </a>, he implied his ignorance of the theft. \"Guys please take note that I am not the guy to stole the art. It was proposed by Auzzii that I use HIS art to make a skin or sticker, which was the worst decision I've made by far looking at what's happening. I've already contacted the artist Canis about this matter and apologized, hoping to get a solution for this matter.\" Unfortunately for sic, the only solution was a lifetime ban from Steam for himself and Auzzii. Making a legend What makes the Howl such a remarkable story is that Valve simply could have remade the skin and wiped its hands of the matter. Valve s redesign was its own property, so there was no need to pull new copies of the weapon from being generated in weapon cases, but in doing so they created CS:GO's most unique skin. Following the redesign of the finish and sticker and the announcement that neither would be attainable beyond the stock that already existed in player's inventories, Valve embraced sic and Auzzie's illicit activities and bumped Howl up into a category all its own by assigning it 'Contraband' level of rarity. To date, no other item in CS:GO carries this descriptor. With the skin no longer available for purchase, the remaining stock quickly became valuable items for any CS:GO player's collection. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://csgo.steamanalyst.com/id/117351\"> Using archive.org to view CSGO Analyst </a>, we can see that by the end of 2014 the skin was being listed at roughly $270. As CS:GO continued to become more popular and the esports scene took off, that price skyrocketed to the $1,800 it is today. The new Howl noticeably changes the wolf in CanisAlbus's work to a more non-descript beast. Skins in CS:GO come in different qualities, but the Factory New with the StatTrak add-on that tallies kills has become an icon among professional players. GuardiaN of team Natus Vincere hoards six StatTrak Howl (Factory New) M4A4s in addition to lesser quality ones a total worth an estimated $12,000. There's no telling how many Howls are still in circulation. Because the Steam marketplace places limits on the price of items, those being sold are through third-party CS:GO trading websites. <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Sticker%20%7C%20Howling%20Dawn?filter=howl\"> Stickers can still be purchased </a> right now for over $150, however. But if you've got a lot of money to burn and are looking to own one of the most sought after finishes in CS:GO, a StatTrak M4A4 Howl (Factory New) is the closest thing CS:GO has to an Excalibur or a Mj lnir. And it's all thanks to two thieving artists. ",

        "contents": "Seven years and counting, CS:GO updates are still dropping. In 2019, CS:GO is going strong with map updates, new events, and balancing changes. Last year brought the biggest update to Counter-Strike in recent history, Danger Zone, a surprise battle royale mode for up to 16 players. The most recent CS:GO update called &quot;Shattered Web&quot; brings actual characters to the game for the first time in the form of equippable skins for each Agent. Here&apos;s a log of the most recent CS:GO patches. The latest CS:GO update: November 18, 2019 <strong>Operation Shattered Web</strong> * Introducing Operation Shattered Web, featuring all-new equippable Agents, weapon collections, missions, and more! * For more details visit&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.counter-strike.net/shatteredweb\">www.counter-strike.net/shatteredweb</a>; <strong>Gameplay</strong> * Increased price of SG553 to $3000 to bring its price more in line with its value. * Reduced the price of FAMAS and Galil by $200 (to $2050 and $1800, respectively); * Improved full-auto spraying accuracy of FAMAS and Galil. <strong>Danger Zone</strong> * Buymenu price adjustments for ssg08 and radar jammer. * Minor timing adjustments for locked door and safe interaction. * Automated sentries now fire M249 bullets. * Added killfeed icon for automated sentry. * Added more explosive barrels. * Tablet crate icons now show an above/below annotation if significantly above or below the player. * Minor change to zone effect visuals. <strong>Misc</strong> * &#x2018;AWP | Hyper Beast&#x2019; and &#x2018;P90 | Nostalgia&#x2019; updated to correct wear at Factory New; <strong>Workshop</strong> Pearlescent coatings: We have added support for applying a pearlescent coating to weapon finishes. Pearlescent coatings use ceramic crystals to reflect and refract light, splitting it into different colors as the view angle changes. This effect can be used in a number of ways to subtly enhance your weapon finish or make drastic changes. The new Operation Shattered Web collections have some weapons with pearlescent coatings to illustrate some of the ways this new feature can be used. The Workshop Workbench has been updated to include this feature so you can experiment with adding this coating to a weapon finish. Using higher values will make the color bands tighter and more frequent and using negative values will flip the spectrum to start on the opposite end. It should be noted that this coating will shift the hue of your weapon finish so parts with no saturation, and therefore no hue, will have no pearlescent effect. We look forward to seeing what interesting applications you come up with. <strong>Maps</strong> * Added Studio to Scrimmage and Casual Sigma map groups. * Added Jungle to the Danger Zone rotation. * Added Lunacy to Flying Scoutsman; * Zoo and Seaside have been removed. <strong>Cache</strong> * Cache has been moved from Scrimmage to Competitive Matchmaking; <strong>Vertigo</strong> * Added ramp to final stage of scaffolding on A ramp, no longer need to jump up; * Connected corridor to back of A with CT elevator room; * Widened top of mid; * Offset doors from CT spawn and to CT elevator room; * Made A site CT death funnel shorter, widened site area; * Removed big block in CT spawn; * Moved A ramp sandbags to allow jump up; * Various bug and clipping fixes; CS:GO update: August 14, 2019 <strong>Berlin 2019</strong> * The &#x201C;Berlin 2019 Viewer Pass&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Berlin 2019 Viewer Pass + 3 Souvenir Tokens&#x201D; are now available for purchase. 50% of the proceeds go to the players and organizations taking part in the StarLadder Berlin Major. * With a Viewer Pass, you&#x2019;ll get:; * An upgradable Berlin 2019 Event Coin. * Access to the Berlin Pick&#x2019;Em Challenge. * Unlimited team graffiti for the duration of the event. * Steam.tv team flair. * Access to Berlin 2019 Souvenir Packages. * All-new Viewer Pass Missions. * Ability to purchase additional Souvenir Tokens. * Team and player autograph stickers are available for purchase. <strong>Misc</strong> * Improved calculation of client packets processing time to account for dedicated server systems where clock can jump backwards. * Optimized client-side processing when kills are scored with StatTrak weapons. <strong>Maps</strong> * Breach has been updated to the latest Workshop version; CS: GO update: July 22, 2019 <strong>Misc</strong> * Added support for displaying Berlin 2019 Minor play-off matches in-game. * Fixed the events lister showing two rows for events that were both favorited and featured. * Adjusted HE grenade collision hull to reduce rolling when dropped. <strong>Maps</strong> Workout: * Retextured the pool area so its a lot brighter; * Made movement in the pool area smoother; * Pushed the hostage rescue zone further forward; * Added CT sided cover to the basketball court; * Made the entire kids zone area much brighter; * Updated some textures and meshes throughout the map; * Due to customer complaints, homebrew coffee have added some bins; * Stopped players being able to slide up the horse at T side stadium entrance; * Fixed mesh clipping issue at the ice cream stand; Ruby: * Overall layout tweaks; Dust 2: * The anniversary celebration has ended; CS:GO update: June 19, 2019 The latest update has some fixed for Dust 2, the retro map Valve added to CS:GO to celebrate 20 years of Counter-Strike.

        "contents": "The CS:GO skin gambling controversy that <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\">kicked off in June</a> seemed to come to a head a couple of weeks ago when Valve <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-issues-cease-and-desist-orders-to-more-than-20-csgo-gambling-sites/\">issued a cease-and-desist</a> letter to more than 20 gambling sites, including CSGO Lounge, one of the first and biggest websites in the questionably legal industry that grew around Valve's game. It was a fairly straightforward proposition: Commercial use of Steam accounts is unlicensed and in violation of the SSA , Valve wrote, and could lead to penalties of various sorts, including the loss of the account outright. The general expectation was that gambling sites would be forced to shut down, although once such site, CSGOBig, <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sotq87\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the closure was only temporary and vowed to return. But CSGO Lounge has taken a different tack by embracing its gambling heritage, even as it denied that it was ever actually a gambling site at all. From the very beginning, the lounge service was intended as an entertainment service for the esports community of Dota2 and CS:GO, and we have never considered it as a real money betting. Virtual items in CS:GO and Dota2 have no monetary value and any community interaction with the virtual items is meant only for entertainment, without any profit interest, a <a href=\"https://csgolounge.com/notice\" target=\"_blank\">recently-posted notice explains</a>. We did not collect any commission or similar until June 2016, where we started doing it in order to improve our items drafting and quality of winnings, compensate items losses due to issues related to our product or issues with Steam community trading, to enable giveaways for the community and add more features to our service in near future. After all the recent events around virtual items and the official letter by Valve, which we have received as well, we were left out alone without any additional information or communication by Valve on this matter. We had to make a decision on how to proceed with Lounges as community place and entertainment service. The situation is highly confusing we are not offering games of luck, we are not offering any transactions with real money or equivalents. Despite those facts, in order to avoid or reduce the confusion, we have decided to acquire a license to legally operate in most of the countries and be able to accept the esports bets by our community, as if it would be real money, it says. Gambling laws differ significantly across the world and even within individual countries, and essentially Lounge is only now making an attempt to implement systems that comply with them. As Evan explained in his <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\">breakdown of the CSGO skin gambling scene</a>, Lounge itself has been operating for about three years without any meaningful checks against a user's age or location. To me, Lounge's rapid move to implement these systems is a tacit admission of wrongdoing. Starting from Monday, 1st August 2016, we will start limiting the access to the betting functionality for users visiting us from countries and regions, where online esports betting is forbidden. We will add additional registration and verification process and we require you to comply with our new Terms of Service if you want to keep using our service. We also remind that our service is only for users who are at least 18 years old, it continues. We will be operating according to the new terms and any transactions related to the items betting functionality will be handled accordingly to the new terms of service, and only on the territories, which do not forbid it by law. The betting feature will be disabled in the following countries and regions, although users will still be able to withdraw any existing winnings and deposits: * United Kingdom; * United States; * Belgium; * France; * French Guiana; * Guernsey; * Gibraltar; * Ireland; * Isle of Man; * Jersey; * Martinique; * French Polynesia; * Reunion; * Mayotte; * Turkey; * Spain; * Scotland; * Israel; The ban on betting from the US, UK, and parts of Europe in particular should severely impact the number of CS:GO items that are bet on the site. CSGO Lounge said it is trying to come up with ways for people in those regions to stay engaged with its site, although it also warned that it can't guarantee the safety or sanctity of items on the site if and when Valve decides to drop the hammer. That's the big question mark hanging over this whole thing. CSGO Lounge appears to be making moves toward legitimacy, but Valve's C&D specifically cites the unlicensed commercial use of Steam as the problem here not that these are gambling sites, but that Steam and Steam services are licensed for personal, non-commercial use only. Even if the Lounge gets squared away as a proper, up-front gambling site, in other words, if it's still making use of Steam, it will presumably still be in violation of the SSA. Theoretically, it could disentangle itself from Steam and operate independently, but given how tightly integrated it, that seems unlikely or at the very least, unlikely to succeed. I've reached out to both Valve and CSGO Lounge for comment. ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-he-grenade-molotov-firebomb-guide/\"> Last week </a> we talked about how to best use HE grenades and firebombs. Knowing how to deal damage and control areas of the map is great, but before you can make use of that knowledge you need to know how to take control in the first place. That s where smoke grenades and flashbangs come in. One-way smokes Is there anything more annoying than to get killed by someone you can t see? A well placed smoke screen will result in what s called a one-way smoke which basically means you can see through it but no one can see you. Spread across the maps are a few known one-way smoke-spots. If you see a smoke in one of those spots it can be a good idea to fire a few shots just to be sure no one s hiding behind it. Here are a couple of examples of one-way smokes: Pop flashes A flashbang that pops as it enter a player s field of vision is called a pop flash. The purpose of pop flashes is to give your opponent as small window to turn around as possible. Often you want to stand just behind a corner and call for a teammate to flash you in. By doing this you ll either find your enemy completely flashed or with his back facing you if you time it right. There are also a few really good pop flashes that can be used without the help of a teammate. A lot of those flashes are used to take control over areas on the map. This flash on Cache is a basic one but really effective as you don t have to turn around: you can just push. Another spot that can be hard to push without using at least one flashbang is short on Dust2. Aim at the slope right next to the stairs and run in a straight line as you throw it. If you succeed it doesn t matter where they re peeking from they re gonna think it s Christmas. Play around on empty servers and try to find flashes like these two. Watching pro matches is probably one of the best ways to find new throws that you didn t know about. <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"> HLTV.org </a> is a great resource when it comes to pro demos. &#xA0;Smoke grenades and timing It takes 15 seconds from when a smoke grenade detonates until it has completely evaporated. Knowing this is key when you want to time plays or just want to delay your opponent s attack. Let s say you re defending B on Dust2 and you ve saved your smoke. They have 40 seconds left on the clock and your teammate on long just saw an enemy. You know the terrorists need four seconds on the clock to plant the bomb. In this scenario you have to make a decision. Do you hold on to the smoke for a few more seconds or do you use it? I d say you should wait and see what happens. If it turns out the terrorist over on the other side of the map didn t fake, you still have your smoke. If it on the other hand was a fake, it s highly unlikely that the rest of their team will push at the exact same time. You can also use firebombs or flashbangs in order to delay the push even further. There are no right answers to these questions. Play the game and eventually you ll find what works for you. Just make sure to pay attention to what usually happens when you do a certain thing and try to learn from it. Another thing that s important when it comes to using grenades is that you don t want to stand out in the open when you throw them. If you peek a spot and want to smoke off that spot you should always back off a bit before you throw it. Most of the times I ve died with a grenade in my hand could ve been avoided and it s really frustrating when it happens. Try to stay focused when you practice. Sloppy play during practice will result in sloppy play in those games that really matter. After all, we are creatures of habit. Strategic use of utility grenades on attack The true beauty of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is found in how well a team coordinates their plays. Watching teams like fnatic or SK Gaming execute their attacks is like standing before the Mona Lisa. If you ve played CS:GO in a team environment you know just how difficult it is to time your smokes and pop flashes perfectly with your teammates. Even if you ve planned all the grenades you re going to use you still need timing and move like a single organism to make the most out of your strategy. Spend some time with your team tightening up your timings. If you don t already have a team I strongly recommend you to try it out if you want to take your game to the next level. You can either try to join an existing team or form one with friends. Both are super rewarding in their own way. Here s a great example of how to execute a strategy as a unit: Na Vi not only shows us the strategy as a whole, but you also get to see what each player does from their point of view.

        "contents": "An Australian senator has announced that he intends to introduce a bill defining Counter-Strike: Counter Offensive as gambling, thanks to its weapon skin trading system. In what looks to be a world first, independent senator Nick Xenophon will introduce the bill when the Australian federal parliament resumes next month. Speaking to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/games/just-when-we-got-used-to-kids-dying-or-killing-on-screen-something-worse-came-along-20160728-gqfp5x.html\">the Sydney Morning Herald</a>, the senator said that Counter-Strike and similar games \"purport to be one thing\" while they're actually \"morphing into full-on gambling and that itself is incredibly misleading and deceptive. \"This is the Wild West of online gambling that is actually targeting kids,\" Xenophon said. According to the report, the legislation could make it illegal for Valve to solicit payments in exchange for items with different, or random, value. Or else, there could be legislated age requirements to play any game featuring a similar economy, or the requirement to warn of gambling related content. Valve has only recently made meaningful steps to curb the fledgling but already very prolific skin gambling market. In <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-says-it-will-soon-start-taking-action-against-csgo-skin-gambling-sites/\">a statement</a> issued earlier this month, Valve made clear that it has no connection with any of the skin gambling sites that have emerged since they introduced in-game item trading. \"A number of gambling sites started leveraging the Steam trading system, and there's been some false assumptions about our involvement with these sites,\" the statement read. \"We'd like to clarify that we have no business relationships with any of these sites. We have never received any revenue from them. And Steam does not have a system for turning in-game items into real world currency.\" This statement was prompted by this month's <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-owners-sued-for-promoting-an-illegal-gambling-service/\">CSGO Lotto scandal</a>, which involved two high profile streamers failing to disclose their direct connection with the gambling site they were promoting.

        "contents": "How to throw grenades Using the primary fire will result in a long range throw, secondary fire a short distance throw and holding both gives you something in between. It's also possible to achieve throws between the normal three by releasing the buttons in different orders and with different timings. Play around with it until you have a feel for your options. <em>Header image courtesy of </em><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341293987\"><em>Faith&Fear</em></a><em> on Steam.</em> In order to be successful in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive you need to be able to take control over the map and deal damage. High explosive grenades (HE) and the two firebombs (incendiary grenade and Molotovs) serve both purposes. A well timed HE can slow your enemy s movement enough for you to pick up an easy kill. They can also be used in combination with either a Molotov or another HE to do even more damage and potentially kill an opponent without ever putting yourself at risk. The difference between a good grenade user and a <em>really </em>good one is how well you coordinate with your teammates. Therefore it s important to know how, why and when to use grenades if you want to improve your game. Updates to incendiary grenades and Molotovs In recent (and not so recent) updates Valve have gradually tuned the two firebombs to the point where they re almost the same. That said, they differ in price. The Molotov costs the terrorists $400 whereas the incendiary grenade costs the counter-terrorists $600. Another difference is that when you hold down either primary fire, secondary fire or both with the Molotov it makes noise that the other team can hear if they re close enough. Moral of the story: you might catch a bullet to your head if you run around ready to throw your Molotov if you opponent hears that it s safe to come around the corner. They do however both deal the same amount of damage and don t damage armor anymore. &#xA0;NIP&#x2019;s creative firebomb round Richard xizt Landstr m, Jacob pyth Mouruj rvi and Christopher GeT_RiGhT Alesund predicted that the former Luminosity (now SK-Gaming) players would push B-long once again, so they decided to do something creative with their incendiary grenades. They flashed, smoked, lined the grenades up and threw them at the same time. Unfortunately for them the flashbang kept the Luminosity players from pushing further. Imagine what could have happened without that flashbang. At the same time they kind of had to use the flashbang in case their opponents decided to rush. But you get the point: if you find the right spots and the right timing you can do some really cool things with firebombs in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Spend some time on empty servers and experiment with approaches. Not only is it fun when you actually come across a useful place to lock down with firebombs, you ll also figure out what doesn t work. &#xA0;Combining Molotovs and HE grenades Here s another example of a NiP play, this time against the French team G2 eSports: It s always risky to move out in the open when you throw a grenade. Unless it s at the beginning of a round or you ve received information telling you that it s safe, you should avoid doing so. Most of the time it s better to bounce grenades off walls from a safe spot. Apart from the fact that Richard xizt Landstr m died, then, this was a really good play. First the Molotov comes in and covers the chokepoint at double doors, forcing the G2 players to move in one of two directions. After that HE grenade explodes: you can see how it slows the terrorists down so that they take even more damage from the fire. Firebomb damage increases over time, so if you can make your enemy stay in it for a longer duration they re going to take massive damage. As you can see, C dric RpK Guipoy and Edouard SmithZz Dubourdeaux are left with 13 and 21 hp respectively. &#xA0;Grenades and vision You can use both firebombs and HE grenades to briefly hide. If you stand really close to a molotov in a tight space you can see your enemy without a problem. Here s how it looks: Note how it s almost impossible to see your opponent from the other side. This is something you can and should use to your advantage if your opponent tries to fry you. Punish them for every mistake they make. That s how you win games in CS:GO. The thick smoke from the HE grenade provides a perfect screen for you to run behind to cross various parts of maps. This example from double doors at Dust2 is probably the most common example: This allows you to save your precious smoke grenades they can come in handy later in the round. Bonus clip Here, Robin flusha R nnquist from fnatic shows us how to use the HE grenade creatively and in the process he picks up an ace against Team Dignitas. First he hides behind the smoke and tries to spot enemy players on the A site. After a while he throws a grenade towards them. If a HE grenade explodes close enough you can t hear anything for a brief moment. Flusha uses that fact to drop down to CT spawn without the Danish players hearing him land. From then on he uses his incredible gamesense and nerve to take them down one by one. <strong>Find all of our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive guides here:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Train Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Train Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Support role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> <strong>Entry fragger role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> <strong>Lurker role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>AWPer role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-leader-guide/\"> <strong>Team leader guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-smg-guide/\"> <strong>SMGs guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/master-sniper-rifles-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Sniper rifles guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-assault-rifle-guide/\"> <strong>Assault rifles guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-pistol-guide/\"> <strong>Pistols guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-worst-weapons/\"> <strong>Worst weapons guide</strong> </a> ",

        "contents": "It s impossible to perfectly balance any game, but the money system in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has succeeded in making an astonishing number of weapons viable more so than in any previous version of the game. Most of the guns in CS:GO are useful in the right circumstances, but even so there are a few that aren t worth your precious dollars. In this article I ll go over the weapons I think are either bad or over-priced. Remember that these are my opinions: everybody s preferences are different. The R8 Revolver Those of us who played CS:GO when they first released this gun remember a game that was almost unplayable. It was so powerful that there was no point buying other weapons. Valve quickly realized their mistake and fixed the issue in a patch a few days later. The R8 s primary fire has a slight delay before it shoots, making it a lot slower than the Desert Eagle. Its secondary fire fans the hammer much like McCree from Overwatch except it s rarely useful in CS:GO. Here s what it looks like in-game: As you can see it s highly inaccurate. I suppose if you give it some time, eat your vegetables and practice like there s no tomorrow, you can probably hit a parked bus from two feet away. With a bit of luck. But then you consider that the R8 costs $850, which is $150 more than the Desert Eagle. Even if they both cost the same, I can t find a good reason why anyone would prefer the R8. Dual Berettas&#xA0; These guys may look cool, but twice as many pistols doesn t mean twice as good. They have high rate of fire and lots of ammunition, but they aren t accurate at all. If you want to invest $500 in a pistol, that money is better spent on a Tec-9, CZ75-Auto or a Five-Seven. Some of you might argue that Christopher GeT_RiGhT Alesund from NiP has used the Dual Berettas a lot in the past, but I would suggest that he would ve been better off with a different pistol. PP-Bizon The PP-Bizon s magazine holds 64 bullets, which is a lot more than any other SMG in the game. But it stops there. The PP-Bizon has inferior damage, accuracy and armor penetration, which are the three most important qualities you look for in a weapon. It s simply not worth investing in. All the other SMGs can do what the PP-Bizon can do but better, except shoot 64 rounds without reloading but by that time the player using the PP-Bizon is usually dead. The AUG The AUG is an assault rifle used by the CTs. It has incredibly good armor penetration and its damage isn t bad. It s also pretty accurate if you know how to use it. Why wouldn t I recommend that anyone use it, then? Because it costs $3300. That s $200 more than an M4A4 or M4A1-s. You get a scope that gives you a smaller field of view when you can shoot just as accurately if not more with any of the M4s without the scope. The AUG isn t a bad weapon per se, but it doesn t make sense to buy one instead of an M4. SG 553 The SG 553 or Krieg 553 is the terrorist counterpart of the AUG. It s basically the same weapon (give or take a few points here and there) but it costs a massive $3500 when you can get an AK-47 for $2700. In my opinion the AK-47 is the best assault rifle in the game. Compared to the AK-47, the SG 553 is an awful weapon that no one should buy. Ever. Here s what the spread looks like when you burst: Essentially, the SG 553 is a very expensive AK-47 that s a lot harder to control. The M249 and the Negev These are the classic troll weapons in Counter-Strike. Getting killed by any of these weapons means you just got owned. It s almost as bad as getting knifed, and no one wants to get knifed in CS:GO. Both the M249 and the Negev have a lot of spread and high recoil. They do put out a lot of damage per second: if you spray. The problem with spraying with these weapons is that they re almost impossible to control. Admittedly the first bullet is pretty accurate, but that alone doesn t warrant a price tag over $5000. What really makes them bad weapons is the fact that they slow down your movement more than any other weapons in the game more than the AWP, even. We all know that being mobile is the key to staying alive in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and you re not while you re using heavy machine guns. Did I mention these weapons are used when you want to humiliate your opponents? Pro play is no different. Just have a look at this round by Nathan NBK Schmitt: This time NBK accidentally bought the Negev but decided to keep it. All I can do is guess, but I think the guys from former Copenhagen Wolves wish that round never happened. As you can see it s still possible to make big plays with weapons you re not supposed to use. CS:GO is a skill-based game and if you re good enough you can make anything work. I do however strongly recommend that you stick to weapons that make more financial sense to buy. You ll simply win more games that way. <strong>Find all of our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive guides here:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Train Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Train Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Support role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> <strong>Entry fragger role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> <strong>Lurker role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>AWPer role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-leader-guide/\"> <strong>Team leader guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-smg-guide/\"> <strong>SMGs guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/master-sniper-rifles-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Sniper rifles guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-assault-rifle-guide/\"> <strong>Assault rifles guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-pistol-guide/\"> <strong>Pistols guide</strong> </a> ",

        "contents": "The CS:GO skin gambling saga continues. After declaring it would <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-says-it-will-soon-start-taking-action-against-csgo-skin-gambling-sites/\">start taking action against a list of alleged guilty parties last week</a>, Valve has now cemented its intentions by issuing cease and desist orders to over 20 different gambling sites (including one Dota2 site) for using their Steam accounts for commercial purposes. In turn, this breaches the terms and conditions of the alleged offenders' Steam Subscriber Agreements. This has been a tricky story to follow, so allow me to recap: although skin gambling in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has existed for about three years, the topic was thrust into the spotlight just over two weeks ago when it emerged betting site CSGO Lotto was in fact owned by two YouTube personalities <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\">who d previously promoted the site</a> without obviously declaring their involvement. If you re unfamiliar with how CS:GO betting works, I d suggest checking out <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\">Evan s detailed overview</a>. As players play the game, they earn cases which, when opened, grants them randomised skins for their weapons. In order to open said cases, you ll need to cough up actual money, and once acquired you can trade with other players. Ultimately the websites in question allow users to bet their skins against match outcomes, or use them to gamble in a variety of casino-style, browser-based games. The short version is that Valve wants to stop this from happening, however to confuse matters further there s also a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-owners-sued-for-promoting-an-illegal-gambling-service/\">concurrent case running against Valve</a> where one Michael John McLeod believes the blame lies not with the many CS:GO betting sites, but with Valve for enabling and supporting their existence. Whether this comes to anything is a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/why-the-csgo-gambling-lawsuit-against-valve-is-fundamentally-flawed/\">matter of debate</a>. Regardless, Valve has since denied any connection to gambling sites and last week announced plans to shut them down. (Evan also explored the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-csgo-skin-prices-after-valves-gambling-ban/\">impact this had on CS:GO skin prices</a>.) Anyway, the list of guilty websites noted above in its entirety was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wykrhm/status/755607652231589888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> tweeted out </a> by esports person Wykrhm Reddy last night, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CSGOBig/status/755582269134286848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> appeared to be corroborated </a> hours later by one of the sites listed CSGOBig who <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1EkBkEqPo3zbTdjWDJIRlJWbUE/view\"> attached Valve s formal complaint </a>. The letter is signed by Valve s general councel Karl Quackenbush and reads as follows: <em> We are aware that you are operating one of the gambling sites listed below. You are using Steam accounts to conduct this business. Your use of Steam is subject to the terms of the Steam Subscriber Agreement (\"SSA\"). Under the SSA Steam and Steam services are licensed for personal, non-commercial use only. </em> <em> Your commercial use of Steam accounts is unlicensed and in violation of the SSA. You should immediately cease and desist further use of your Steam accounts for any commercial purpose. If you fail to do this within ten (10) days Valve will pursue all available remedies including without limitation terminating your accounts. </em> In response, <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sotq87\">CSGOBig suggests</a> it is only shutting down temporarily and that it ll definitely be back soon.\" The wording of Valve s pretty explicit order, though, might suggest otherwise. We ve contacted Valve for further comment and will update as and when we hear back. ",

        "contents": "Allegations were raised earlier this week that James \"PhantomL0rd\" Varga, a Twitch streamer who according to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/phantoml0rd-csgoshuffle-allegation-skin-gambling-scandal\">PCGamesN</a> has or had nearly 1.4 million followers, is also the owner of CSGO skin gambling site CSGOShuffle, which he heavily promoted on his channel without any sort of disclosure. The claims came to light after a hacker who was actually trying to rip the site off discovered Skype logs of conversations between Varga and CSGOShuffle coder Duhau Joris, which he provided to YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3ltGjUBUo\">Richard Lewis</a>. There's no photo of Varga standing over a body with a smoking gun in his hand, but Lewis says the exchanges between him and Joris heavily suggest, almost to a degree of certainty, that PhantomL0rd is the owner of CSGOShuffle, and on top of that, he has gambled exclusively with 'house money' taken from the business. The logs he presents in his video would appear to bear that out: Varga makes some rather large payments to Joris, seeks help winning bets, and appears clearly to be the man in charge. The whole thing has powerful echoes of the recent <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\">CSGO Lotto fiasco</a>, in that it appears all but certain that Varga was using his channel to promote a gambling site that he has a financial interest in. This is not allowed by either the FTC or Valve, and Twitch recently <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/twitch-clarifies-its-position-on-csgo-skin-gambling-controversy/\">clarified its own position</a> on the matter, which is basically that if a streamer breaks a third-party's terms of service, he also breaks Twitch's, and will be punished accordingly. And that's what appears to have happened to Phantoml0rd, whose <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/phantoml0rd\">Twitch channel</a> has been closed due to terms of service violations. Specific reasons for the shutdown aren't provided, and Varga himself seems to have gone to ground: He hasn't <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhantomL0rd\">tweeted</a> or posted a video to his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGeHk-_K6Lee4CcVN2SKI2A\">YouTube</a> channel since July 16, when he proclaimed ironically, as it turns out that his channel was about to undergo a big change. The <a href=\"https://csgoshuffle.com/\">CSGOShuffle website</a> is also currently down. I've reached out to Varga for comment, and will update if and when I receive a reply. ",

        "contents": "Counter-Strike tournaments are rife with moments of incredible skill as players push themselves to their limits in jaw-dropping performances. These stupefying moments, combining <em>just</em> the right amount of skill, luck and bravado leave people talking for months. In a unique approach to the competitive scene, Valve has taken recognition one step further, immortalising events in-game through graffiti and signs. As CS continues to develop, these memorials embed the competitive history of the game within each map, offering long-term fans a nod of recognition while advertising key moments for new players to look back to. The most recent commemorative addition to the game came from the recent ESL One Cologne Major, where Team Liquid s Oleksandr s1mple Kostyliev <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/cache-s1mple-tribute/\"> hit two unscoped AWP shots in a row to beat Swedish powerhouses, Fnatic </a>. Entering the B-bombsite on Cache through heaven, s1mple eliminates one player while falling before flicking to a second kill at absurd range. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcaDca4Nidc\">Here's the video.</a> The moment highlights a spectacular tournament for both Liquid and s1mple, carving their path to a first North American major final. Map creator FMPONE was quick to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FMPONE/status/752604330700660736\"> post a design to twitter </a>. The mockup, which shows an angelic counter terrorist descending while the scope falls from his weapon, has since been added to the game. There have been many phenomenal individual plays in competitive CS, but SK s Marcelo coldzera David holds what could prove to be CS:GO s true standout moment. At a 15-9 scoreline, Team Liquid needed just one round to secure victory over the Brazilians (then Luminosity Gaming) at the 2016 MLG Colombus Major. With absolutely no margin for error, coldzera led a crucial AWP defence of Mirage s B-bombsite. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlFFiTSdLOY\">Here's the video.</a> Quickly dispatching one player, cold follows up with an unbelievable, unscoped, jumping double-kill. Seemingly unfazed, he then finishes one more player with a sharp, reactive noscope. Such a performance was crushing to Liquid who proceeded to lose the match in a double-overtime. Luminosity, however, went on to win the Major. Tucked away by the van on Mirage s B-site you can now find a winged AWP, adorned by four red skulls taking the place of the gun s scope. The design proved so popular that cold <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EL/status/736397635527966720\"> commissioned a tattoo artist to replicate it on his arm </a>. Swedes Fnatic are no strangers to employing avant-garde tactics in the competitive scene, with player JW well known for his sawed-off shotgun dominance on Cobblestone. At Cologne 2015, Fnatic utilised an aggressive AWP play to push an overtime victory against French side EnVyUs. At $4750 dollars coupled with a lack of flexibility, it s rare to see teams run more than one AWP per round, with more than two all but unheard of. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asDtlvn7N5U\">Here's the video.</a> However, having built an enormous bank of cash for the final round of the half Fnatic chose to empty their reserves. In what must have been the professional equivalent of a jump-scare for EnVyUs apEX, he stepped out to contest the centre of Dust2 only to find himself facing not one, but <em>four</em> AWPs. Gaining an early advantage, many of Fnatic even swapped back to AKs to overwhelm the French side. Resting high over the T s mid sightline, a grinning terrorist now watches over, wielding a ludicrous four sniper rifles. CS:GO s molotovs are no joke, capable of delaying pushes, dealing serious damage and, crucially, denying bomb plants. With little time left on the clock, even an outnumbered player can make use of a well thrown molotov to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbe1tvbIRzM\"> win the round. </a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mao-UqnJ3SI\">Here's the video.</a> Would that threat stop Fnatic s Olof olofmeister Kajbjer Gustafsson? Not a chance. At 14 rounds a piece in the 2014 Cologne Major, the bold Swede wasn t about to let a little heat stop their run, completing a full five second defuse while burning, dying just a fraction of a second after the bomb was defused, much to the delight of his team and fans. In one of the first real nods to the competitive scene, Valve added graffiti of a Hazmat-adorned angel, defusing while wreathed in flames. During 2014-15, Fnatic established themselves as the dominant force in CS, winning titles left, right and centre. Despite this, Fnatic haven t always proven popular. During the Dreamhack Winter semifinals of 2015, Fnatic revealed an outrageous boost against LDLC, stacking players on top of each other to gain an unprecedented sightline across the map. Having lost the first half 12-3, Olof s sniping dominated the bewildered French side into submission. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNQ71mfmt80\">Here's the video.</a> The boost proved so controversial that the match was put in for review to see if it violated any rules for the tournament. Sure to go down in CS history, the play resulted in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRY_TRipfpQ\"> countless analysis videos </a> and the entertainingly terrible <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oqqPCPFdRE\"> musical tributes </a>. Extra controversy was raised after it was revealed Fnatic s coach had actively stifled knowledge of the spot through take down of YouTube videos. After heated discussion with tournament admins, Fnatic eventually forfeited their place, allowing LDLC to progress to the final. Valve acknowledged the exploit with the addition of a warning sign, reading gel nder bersteigen verboten! or surpassing the rails is forbidden! Combining memories of both bravery and infamy, it s little surprise Overpass is sometimes referred to as Olofpass. CS:GO s map secrets have been known to acknowledge more than just competitive events. Tucked in the corner of Dust2 s A-bombsite is a rather unassuming goose spray which serves to honour Minh 'gooseman' Le, a co-developer of the original CS mod. The spray existed as far back as CS 1.6. In recognition of one of CS:GO s more entertaining bugs, Train has a small sign asking players not to step on the birds, after the introduction of pigeons to the map allowed players to <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/EnergeticExemplaryIlladopsis\">ride them out of the map boundaries</a>. In a game renowned for it s high skill ceiling and serious competition, It s nice enjoy a bit of levity through the surprising number of playful easter eggs. A personal favorite is the chicken followers, whereby If you press E on a chicken, it will <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/MajesticNimbleBuckeyebutterfly\">follow you through the map</a> until killed, even spawning with you in the following round.

        "contents": "On Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-says-it-will-soon-start-taking-action-against-csgo-skin-gambling-sites/\"> Valve announced </a> it would begin sending requests to cease operations to gambling websites that use Steam s trading system. Using the OpenID API and making the same web calls as Steam users to run a gambling business is not allowed by our API nor our user agreements, wrote Valve s Erik Johnson. The announcement was a surprise. Although scrutiny of CS:GO gambling peaked as it was <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\"> revealed </a> that two of the world s most popular gaming YouTubers had created a CS:GO skin gambling website and quietly promoted it to their audiences, some of these services have existed <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"> for three years </a>. Other than a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\"> match fixing scandal </a> in 2015 this was the first time that Valve has addressed them. The drop in price seems reactionary, a reflection of some sellers fear that the market would implode. Valve s announcement implied that Steam users should retrieve item skins from gambling websites, and some members of the community began to wonder: would Valve s action trigger a crash of CS:GO s skin market? Some Steam users own <a href=\"http://csgo.steamanalyst.com/inventory-top500\"> hundreds of thousands of dollars </a> worth of CS:GO skins. How would their fortunes, and the inventory value of CS:GO s other 10 million active players, be affected by this announcement? Not much. Although there isn t an index number that reflects the value of the CS:GO item market as a whole, sales data for individual weapons tend to show an initial reaction to the news, followed by normalization. Valve s announcement went out via email just before 1 PM Pacific on June 13. I sampled a set of 20 arbitrary, higher-volume skins on the market, and found that they fell an average of <strong>13.7%</strong> that evening. A <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20%7C%20BOOM%20%28Minimal%20Wear%29\"> Minimum Wear AWP BOOM </a> skin, for example, dropped from $21.75 to $18.56 12 hours after the announcement. The drop in price seems reactionary, a reflection of some sellers fear that the market would implode. Although the correction was very uniform across the items I sampled, most items have not continued to drop in value, and many have risen back to their pre-announcement price. More adjustments can probably be expected as gambling websites close or alter how they operate, but my belief is that these items will retain most of their value as long as CS:GO remains one of the most-played and most-spectated games in the world.

If you also know <em>how</em> to use them you can do some serious damage to your opponent s game plan. Win the pistol round and you set yourselves up for a great half. If on the other hand you lose the pistol round, there are ways to limit the damage done to your economy. Needless to say you should practice pistols and pay attention to their strengths and weaknesses. &#xA0;The pistol round The Glock-18, USP-s and P2000 have one thing in common: they don t penetrate armor. However they do a lot of damage against enemies without armor, especially head armor. On the pistol round you only have $800, which isn t enough to get a helmet. Because of this fact the three pistols mentioned above work really well in pistol rounds. A lot of the time it s better to invest in armor than to upgrade to another pistol. There are exceptions, however, and I will get to them soon. Another option is to buy a few grenades as long as you have a plan. It s also worth mentioning that one player on the CT-side could invest in a defuse kit. Nothing is more frustrating than killing the other team on an attempted retake only to find yourself in a situation where you don t have time enough to defuse the bomb. &#xA0;The Glock-18 The Glock-18 isn t as accurate as the USP-s or the P2000, but it holds 20 bullets and has very little spread. This means it s a really good pistol to run and gun with. What you want to do when you play the Glock-18 on pistol rounds is to get as close to your opponents as possible and aim for their heads. They are likely to be wearing body armor and the Glock-18 has the worst armor penetration of all the pistols in the game. It s often wise to have one or two players buy flashbangs and a smoke just to make it easier for you to get closer to the defending players. Just don t use Glock-18 on eco rounds unless you really need to in order to afford a full buy later on. &#xA0;The USP-s and P2000 These two pistols are insanely accurate over great distances compared to the terrorist counterpart. As a result, you want to do the exact opposite of what the terrorists want. Your job is to make sure you can keep the fight at long distances. As long as you can do that, all you have to do is to tap slowly and aim for their heads. &#xA0;The P250 The P250 is a great pistol that s very accurate at medium range. It also has a lot better armor penetration than the Glock-18, USP-s and P2000, which makes it ideal for the second round if you lose the pistol round. The exception is if you re on the terrorist side and got the plant but lost the round. In this case you shouldn t buy anything at all, and go for a full buy on the third round instead. In particular, buy the P250 if you re going to defend or attack an area where you think you can get close enough to steal an SMG with a fast headshot. &#xA0;The Tec-9 and CZ75-Auto These can be some of the most powerful pistols in the game if used correctly. The Tec-9 is one of the exceptions for pistol rounds that I mentioned earlier. One player can buy armor and have a teammate drop him a Tec-9. That gives the terrorists an almost impossible force of nature to lead the charge. It s also a great weapon to buy on force buys if you re planning on running a fast strategy. It s super powerful and fires rounds really fast. It isn t that accurate, however, which means you need to get close. Much like the Glock-18 it doesn t have that much spread, so it s ideal to run and gun with. The CZ75-Auto can one-shot people at close range even if they have head armor. It s one of the most powerful weapons in the game, but it s incredibly hard to control. It holds 12 bullets per magazine and it shoots really fast. This means that you have to lurk around corners and catch people off guard. You ll most likely only get one chance, so make the most of it. If you manage to kill an enemy with either an AWP or an assault rifle you ve done significant damage to the other team s economy and it was a good investment to buy the CZ75-Auto. &#xA0;Five-Seven The Five-Seven can be equipped instead of the CZ75-Auto in the loadout menu for the counter-terrorist side. It holds 20 bullets and can kill armored players with a single shot to the head. It s low spread and high armor penetration makes it great to spam bullets with at close range. If you re a bit farther away from your target you should go for slower taps instead. At only $500 the Five-Seven is a great alternative to the P250 in the second round if you are feeling confident that you can take out at least one enemy. &#xA0;The Desert Eagle One of the game s most iconic weapons. Over the years the Desert Eagle has given us a lot of highlight videos to enjoy and envy. I m looking at you, Happy. The Desert Eagle costs $700, making it the most expensive pistol in the game. It s really accurate at medium range and fairly accurate at long range as well and famous for its incredible one-shot potential. You can buy the Desert Eagle if you re a great aimer and you know you can afford a full buy on the following round or if your team decides to force buy. It is a real hand cannon, so don t underestimate its power. Master it and your opponents will have reasons to fear you even if you can t afford the bigger toys. <strong>Find all of our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive guides here:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Train Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Train Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Support role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> <strong>Entry fragger role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> <strong>Lurker role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>AWPer role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-leader-guide/\"> <strong>Team leader guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-smg-guide/\"> <strong>SMGs guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/master-sniper-rifles-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Sniper rifles guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-assault-rifle-guide/\"> <strong>Assault rifles guide</strong> </a> ",

        "contents": "In a welcome move earlier today, Valve <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-says-it-will-soon-start-taking-action-against-csgo-skin-gambling-sites/\">made its position clear</a> regarding the use of Steam's in-game item trading functionality, and its use by CS:GO weapon skin gambling sites. Basically, the company confirmed that it's not permitted, writing that the use of \"the OpenID API and making the same web calls as Steam users to run a gambling business is not allowed by our API nor our user agreements.\" Valve wrote that it intends to send requests to gambling sites to cease their operations, and if they don't, Valve will \"pursue the matter as necessary\". Following that statement, Twitch has made one of its own, and while it's not necessarily a new update to its terms of service, it makes explicit that streaming gambling activities of this nature is not allowed at least in cases where the gambling runs contrary to the third-party's TOS, such as it does with Steam. \"As a reminder, per Twitch s <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/p/terms-of-service\">Terms of Service</a>, broadcasters are not permitted to stream content that breaks the terms of service or user agreements of third-parties,\" <a href=\"https://blog.twitch.tv/twitch-and-third-party-terms-of-service-and-user-agreements-b9827599e0fc#.xbr84f2kc\">the statement reads</a>. \"As such, content in which the broadcaster uses or promotes services that violate Valve s stated restrictions is prohibited on Twitch. Our <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/p/rules-of-conduct\">Rules of Conduct</a> lists other examples such as playing pirated games and playing on unauthorized private servers.\" These statements follow revelations last week that two popular CS:GO streamers had not disclosed their co-ownership of CSGO Lotto, despite producing videos using the gambling site. That has prompted closer scrutiny of the skin gambling scene as a whole. ",

Furthermore, it warns that it will soon begin taking action against them, and hinted at possible negative consequences for players who use gambling sites as well. The statement in full: <em>\"In 2011, we added a feature to Steam that enabled users to trade in-game items as a way to make it easier for people to get the items they wanted in games featuring in-game economies.</em> <em>Since then a number of gambling sites started leveraging the Steam trading system, and there's been some false assumptions about our involvement with these sites. We'd like to clarify that we have no business relationships with any of these sites. We have never received any revenue from them. And Steam does not have a system for turning in-game items into real world currency.</em> <em>These sites have basically pieced together their operations in two-part fashion. First, they are using the OpenID API as a way for users to prove ownership of their Steam accounts and items. Any other information they obtain about a user's Steam account is either manually disclosed by the user or obtained from the user's Steam Community profile (when the user has chosen to make their profile public). Second, they create automated Steam accounts that make the same web calls as individual Steam users.</em> <em>Using the OpenID API and making the same web calls as Steam users to run a gambling business is not allowed by our API nor our user agreements. We are going to start sending notices to these sites requesting they cease operations through Steam, and further pursue the matter as necessary. Users should probably consider this information as they manage their in-game item inventory and trade activity.\"</em> Valve is currently at the center of a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-owners-sued-for-promoting-an-illegal-gambling-service/\">lawsuit over CS:GO skin gambling</a>, to which CSGO Lotto co-owners Trevor \"Tmartn\" Martin and Thomas Cassell were recently added. We said in our analysis of the suit that it is <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/why-the-csgo-gambling-lawsuit-against-valve-is-fundamentally-flawed/\">fundamentally flawed</a>, but even so it looks like Valve is anxious to put the matter to bed or at the very least, to be seen doing its part to make it happen.

A familiar format will see 20 CS:GO teams going head-to-head ten from North America and ten from Europe and the tournament will hold its first ever open qualifiers for teams interested in joining the ECS. That last part is of course great news for potential emerging talent, which will see prospective inductees compete in four rounds taking place between August 5 to August 27. Winners of each qualifying round will join up with four invited teams within each region s ECS developmental league; with the top two teams there competing against the bottom two of last term s ECS Season One. Finally, the two winners from each region s promotion matches will join the remaining eight teams from Season One to form Season Two.

        "contents": "<strong>Update:</strong> Nearly three months later, s1mple the player who pulled off the amazing double-noscope worthy of in-game graffiti has commemorated it further by getting that graffiti tattooed on his arm. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/s1mpleO/status/784370680896819200\">tweeted a photo</a> of the finished ink earlier today, which was apparently a birthday gift from his brother. This comes off the back of s1mple playing out of his mind as ESL One New York this past weekend. The craziest moment of the tournament came when he <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/watch-the-most-ridiculous-play-from-this-weekends-csgo-tournament/\">threw his AWP o</a><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/watch-the-most-ridiculous-play-from-this-weekends-csgo-tournament/\">ver</a><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/watch-the-most-ridiculous-play-from-this-weekends-csgo-tournament/\"> a wall</a> as a distraction, before dropping down and taking out the last member of the opposing team. At this point, I think it's safe to say s1mple produces some of the most exciting clips in competitive CS:GO. <strong>Original story: </strong>At ESL Cologne last weekend, Team Liquid became the first North American CS:GO team to make it into the final round of a major tournament. To do it, they had to defeat the team with the most major <em>wins</em> in CS:GO history: Fnatic, the Swedish superstars, the New England Patriots of Counter-Strike. Liquid won their semifinal round against Fnatic two maps to none, an upset that's worth watching <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/match/2303393-liquid-fnatic-esl-one-cologne-2016\" target=\"_blank\">online</a> or through CS:GO's in-game archive. Although there were several clutch plays from Liquid, a spectacular one came from s1mple in round 14 of the second map. S1mple's first noscope is impressive enough, delivered as he hits the ground. The second is ludicrous, tagging the Fnatic player at a range that no mortal has a right to. Even though Liquid were ahead 10-4 at this point, it was a round that Liquid weren't supposed to win against a team that's more than capable of staging a comeback in the second half of the match. It surely dealt some emotional damage to the Swedes. One of the creators of de_cache, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/shawn-fmpone-snelling-details-csgos-santorini-map/\" target=\"_blank\">FMPONE</a>, felt the need to commemorate this sick play by adding a graffiti tag on the wall near where it happened. The revision hasn't been submitted yet by FMPONE, so you won't see it in game at this time, but the art depicts a falling angel with a scopeless rifle between the two CT entrances to bombsite B. \"It's an excellent example of when the casters and everyone, including myself, counts a player out, but that player believes in themselves fully and outperforms all expectations in a great moment,\" FMPONE told me today. \"I thought the casting from James Bardolph and DDK sealed the deal and moved me to make it just as much as the excellent play, as well.\" American himself, FMPONE says that he isn't partial to Team Liquid, but admits that \"the fact that this play was instrumental in the very first NA grand finalist is critical.\" The painted figure wears wings because elevated platforms in Counter-Strike are often shortened to 'heaven' for easy communication in-game. There's a few of these kinds of <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517629399\"> map references in CS:GO </a>, little signatures of moments, or even bugs, that add permanence and history to a context that otherwise never seems to change. Liquid fell in the finals to Brazilian squad SK Gaming, who took their second consecutive major, another massive achievement for the South American team. But this moment by s1mple, and the milestone for North American Counter-Strike that it signifies, should live on in de_cache as a memory of what Liquid achieved. ",

        "contents": "The past week has been an ugly one for the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">CS:GO</a> gambling scene. First it came to light that popular YouTubers Trevor 'TmarTn' Martin and Tom 'ProSyndicate' Cassell were actually the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\">owners of a gambling site</a> they'd been promoting on their channels, without any disclosure of that ownership or the gross conflict of interest. Shortly after that, another YouTuber, Lewis PsiSyndicate Stewart revealed that some of the random CS:GO skin unboxings he'd posted on his channel <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/youtuber-admits-that-his-csgo-skin-betting-videos-were-rigged/\">were rigged</a> as well. Now Stewart has shared the email exchanges between him and skin gambling site Steamloto the source of his CS:GO loot in which the site very blatantly invites him to create a rigged video. Steamloto is not CSGO Lotto, the site that Cassell and TmarTn created. Stewart's email chain, which goes all the way back to October 2015, begins with a brief explanation of how the site works and an inquiry about buying an ad video, but then quickly shifts into a request for something more underhanded. In response to Stewart's suggestion for a video with 5 or 10 of the knives, advertising it as a kind of new up and coming CSGO website idea, Andrew Pryamov of Steamloto wrote, Well, how about you make a video where you try to open like 2-3 restricted ones, and ~2 covert ones. And on your last attempt you get FT Dragon Lore (you'll keep it as a payment). A Dragon Lore AWP is one of the most coveted skins in CS:GO. Although CS:GO weapon prices fluctuate over time, according to <a href=\"http://csgo.steamanalyst.com/id/120449\">CSGO Analyst</a> they're currently worth $700 or more. Stewart <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_1927730765&feature=iv&src_vid=XCKdE9TGmgs&v=r8p_yOhl7e4\">made the video as requested</a>, and he did in fact get his Dragon Lore AWP and also made a big deal of selling his tremendous stroke of good fortune and surprise. In late May of this year, Steamloto requested the creation of another video, and again, there seems to be little interest in transparency or disclosure. Stewart actually recommended that it be set up in a way that it's transparent it was rigged, but Pryamov asks that the second video be kept the same as the first, with just a notation that it's sponsored : In other words, acknowledgment that Steamloto paid for the promotion, but not that the unboxing was rigged. Again, this shady Steamloto promotion isn't related to the CSGO Lotto scam, but it does provide insight into how lucrative skin gambling can be Stewart claimed in his admission that he got $3200 worth of skins for making the two videos and how widespread the problem of undisclosed conflicts of interest really is. I couldn't put a number on it, he said in an email. It's just a lot of new site owners are willing to throw for example $1000 in skins at you just to play on their site, because they know they can easily make more in return from a video which garners 30k views. Rates can vary from $500-$2500 or so in my size, just for one video, he added, and \"sometimes PayPal money is involved, sometimes it's not. all a lot of mixed stuff. Unlike the owners of CSGO Lotto, Stewart said he's not facing any <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-owners-sued-for-promoting-an-illegal-gambling-service/\"> legal consequences </a> for his role in promoting Steamloto, because he's just not big enough for anyone to care that much about it. Getting in front of the trouble by acknowledging that the videos were rigged, and giving away the skins he received for them, no doubt helped as well. But on the whole, CS:GO skin gambling is a big mess for the FTC, he said. We've put together a detailed breakdown of <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"> how CS:GO skin gambling works </a>, along with an analysis of why the CS:GO gambling lawsuit brought against Valve last month (and to which CSGO Lotto co-owners Martin and Cassell were recently added) is \"<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/why-the-csgo-gambling-lawsuit-against-valve-is-fundamentally-flawed/\"> fundamentally flawed </a>.\" If you're at all curious about why this is a big deal, they're both absolutely worth your time.

        "contents": "$2.3 billion. That's how much Bloomberg <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-virtual-guns-counterstrike-gambling/\"> reports </a> the market for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive betting is worth. That's serious money, and it's attracting a lot of scrutiny. One CS:GO player has even taken it upon himself to file a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/316578160/Michael-John-McLeod-et-al-vs-Valve-Corporation#from_embed\"> against Valve </a>, claiming that the operator of Steam has knowingly allowed an illegal online gambling market and has been complicit in creating, sustaining and facilitating that market. The complainant, Michael John McLeod, believes the blame lies not with the many CS:GO betting sites, but with Valve for enabling and supporting their existence. But while his accusation is worth consideration, his arguments are deeply flawed. McLeod makes numerous comparisons to casinos, claiming Valve owns the league, sells the casino chips, and receives a piece of the casino's income. This analogy only works, though, if you completely ignore the nature of the skins being traded. For those unfamiliar with <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"> how CS:GO betting works </a>, players earn cases as they play the game which they can open to receive random skins for their weapons. Opening cases requires buying keys with real money, and once acquired, skins can be traded with other players. This is where the gambling component comes in: many websites allow users to stake their skins on the outcomes of CS:GO matches or even simple coin flips. CSGO Lounge, one of the most popular betting websites. The crucial differentiator here that undermines McLeod's analogy is the fact that skins, unlike casino chips, do not exist primarily as a form of non-money currency. Whereas casinos use chips to exploit legal loopholes in staking cash and to distance gamblers from the money they ve already essentially spent, Valve implemented skins as a means of customization and creative expression, both for the makers of the skins and those who use them. The use of skins evolved later, goes beyond their intended purpose, and was seemingly driven by third-parties, which weakens McLeod's argument that Valve built and supports the betting economy. The complainant, Michael John McLeod, believes the blame lies not with the many CS:GO betting sites, but with Valve for enabling and supporting their existence. McLeod posits that Valve has created and currently supports a secondary marketplace where these in-game purchases can be gambled and cashed out. Claiming that Valve created the betting economy is bold, implying that Valve wittingly contributed to the creation of the third-party gambling sites. McLeod highlights the fact that users are able to link their Steam accounts to these sites, insisting that it requires permission and cooperation from Valve. This is incorrect. For a site to implement Steam account linking, it simply needs a Steam Web API key, a token that anyone with a Steam account can acquire. There is no vetting or approval process involved, and Valve certainly does not exactly what these sites are, what users are doing. Furthermore, McLeod misrepresents the process of converting skins into currency on these betting sites. He claims Valve specifically allows players to transfer skins to third-party when this is not the case. By linking a Steam account to one of these sites, that site is only able to view a user's Steam inventory, not interact with it directly. To transfer skins, a user must engage in <a href=\"https://www.csgolounge.com/guide\"> bot trading </a>, which is a flimsy workaround where dummy Steam accounts created by the sites act as middlemen for the bets. This is in clear violation of Steam's <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/\"> Terms of Service </a>, first in Section 4 with reference to bots: <em>You may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process.</em> As well as in reference to external trading in Section 3, Subsection D: <em>You also understand and acknowledge that Subscriptions traded, sold or purchased in any Subscription Marketplace are license rights, that you have no ownership interest in such Subscriptions, and that Valve does not recognize any transfers of Subscriptions (including transfers by operation of law) that are made outside of Steam.</em> McLeod points out the presence of the Steam logo on the betting sites, implying that it reflects tacit cooperation on Valve's part. Ignoring the fact that anyone can past the Steam logo on their site without permission from Valve, the page that users are taken to upon clicking the Steam link expressly states that the site in question is not affiliated with Steam or Valve. Nevertheless, McLeod claims this is more evidence of collusion between Valve and the betting sites. The lawsuit has attracted the attention of lawyers with experience in the esports industry. A recent <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esports-lawyers-dissect-csgo-gambling-in-reddit-ama/\"> AMA on Reddit </a> hosted by legal professionals Bryce Blum, Ryan Morrison, and Jeff Ifrah supports the notion that the arguments against Valve hold little weight. Ifrah believes that Holding Valve responsible for every single thing that a player or gambler might do with a skin once it is out of Valve s hands of course sounds harsh, saying that the only valid argument might be that Valve could have done more to slow the success of the secondary skin betting market. Blum agrees, saying I ve yet to speak to an attorney that reviewed the complaint and thought the case was likely to get past a motion to dismiss. Many skins are valued at hundreds on the Steam Community Market, and thousands outside of it. But Steam users may lose their rights to such items by depositing items to third-party services. Per the Steam TOS, \"Valve does not recognize any transfers of Subscriptions (including transfers by operation of law) that are made outside of Steam.\" Following McLeod's lawsuit, an anonymous mother has filed <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/317712965/C-B-N-B-vs-Valve-Corporation-CSGO-Lotto-Trevor-Martin-and-Thomas-Cassell\"> a similar suit </a> against not just Valve, but Trevor Martin and Thomas Cassell, the owners of CS:GO betting site CSGO Lotto. Martin and Cassell are accused of deceiving viewers of their YouTube betting videos, in which they do not disclose that they own the site they are betting on. Their addition to the lawsuit, however, is a pursuant claim that does not affect the arguments against Valve. McLeod's arguments fall apart under proper consideration. That's not to say, though, that Valve is necessarily innocent in all this. Legal precedent for the betting of virtual goods is lacking, and it will take cases like McLeod's to establish clear and decisive rules. Valve might be responsible for not taking sufficient steps to regulate the betting economy, but such a verdict cannot be made on McLeod's weak evidence alone. Illegal and/or unethical gambling should not be taken lightly. If we're going to discuss it, let's at least make sure we have the facts straight. ",

The suit alleges that Valve has knowingly allowed an illegal online gambling market to flourish around the purchase, trade, and wagering of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive skins. CSGO Lounge, CSGO Diamonds, and OPSkins are already cited in the action as unnamed co-conspirators, but the Polygon report says the amendment now names Martin and Cassell as defendants also. As owners of the site, they actively promote Lotto as a gambling service, including to minors, it says. It's probably not the end of Martin and Cassell's legal woes, but it's certainly an interesting beginning. This lawsuit covers much greater range, and with far broader implications, than the simple question of <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\">what the CSGO Lotto owners did</a>, and which regulations they broke along the way, and that could actually make it tougher to successfully prosecute.

Martin <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/tmartn-apology-video/\">posted an apology video yesterday</a>, but quickly removed it following a powerful wave of criticism of his obvious effort to shift blame and dodge responsibility.

        "contents": "<em><strong>Update: </strong></em><em>TmarTn removed his original apology video from YouTube. We've posted a reupload of the video above.</em> Trevor '<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TmarTn\" target=\"_blank\">TmarTn</a>' Martin, one of the YouTubers who was recently <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\"> revealed </a> as the owner of CSGO Lotto, the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"> skin gambling </a> website he'd been promoting on his channel without disclosing his interest in it has issued an apology video in which he states that he's sorry if he didn't make his relationship to the site clear enough for everyone. The video begins with Martin kissing his dog in the foyer of his seemingly-very-expensive mansion, with a big truck strategically framed in the double doors behind him. He professes his love and appreciation for his viewers, whose support enables him to chase his dreams and follow his passions, before moving on to explain that, if you didn't know he was the owner of CSGO Lotto, and thus profiting from its success, well, that's your own fault. My connection to CSGO Lotto has been a matter of public record. TmarTn My connection to CSGO Lotto has been a matter of public record since the company was first organized in December of 2015, he says, seemingly reading from a prepared message. However, I do feel like I owe you guys an apology. I am sorry to each and every one of you who felt like that was not made clear enough to you. I truly, honestly hope that you guys give me an opportunity to earn your trust back. But attorney <a href=\"http://morrisonlee.com/\"> Ryan Morrison </a>, one of the three attorneys who took part in a recent Reddit AMA on the matter, said that's not nearly good enough. He means someone could ve searched for that public document, which is utter stupidity, Morrison told us today over Skype. Even if he wrote it in the text underneath his video as he s gone back and done, that s still not sufficient disclosure. He couldn t be further away in terms of compliance. Martin vowed to ensure that his YouTube channel and all other business are in compliance with the law, and made a point of stating that he does not condone minors using the CSGO Lotto site. This is and always has been a clearly stated policy available both in the terms of service as well as the initial signup page on the website, he says. Furthermore, We do not knowingly record information of children under the age of 13 years in compliance with the COPA Act. This has nothing to do with, and does not mean, that we condone minors under the age of 18 to play on the site. But that too falls far short of what's required in Morrison's eyes. We have online gambling that is completely unregulated as far as I can tell from CSGO Lotto, they don t age verify minus one little check tick when you sign up for an account, which is nowhere near enough age verification, he said. They allow you to put in and take out basically as you please, and there s no attempt to follow the different gambling regulations that exist, even in terms of percentages of winning and things like that. Some jurisdictions don t allow you to increase the odds of winning if you put in more money and here that s quite literally how the website works. He s done zero disclosure, especially along the FTC guidelines. Ryan Morrison, attorney Martin is obviously less interested in apologizing than in protecting himself and his company, but these late-game maneuvers may not do him much good. I can t say there s going to be prosecution but I ve said a couple times and I still very much believe that it s as close to a sure thing as possible, Morrison continued. If you look at FanDuel and DraftKings and how many states have gone after those guys now, they re gonna see that this is infinitely worse than anything DraftKings and FanDuel was doing and getting similar attention if not more attention. I refuse to believe there s not a legislator, a district attorney, a state whatever that s not going to make this into a criminal matter. And if that should happen, the potential penalties are very stiff. FTC guidelines are not technically a law in the sense that it has criminal charges, Morrison explained. But it can act like a court. They can seize assets, they can fine you to oblivion, they can do a ton of really scary stuff. Beyond potential FTC penalties for the lack of clear disclosure, Martin and Tom Syndicate Cassell could face separate, criminal prosecution for operating CSGO Lotto. <em>Additional reporting by Evan Lahti</em>. <strong>Update:</strong> Martin has retained the services of law firm Watson LLP, which has issued a statement on the matter to <a href=\"http://www.pcinvasion.com/csgolotto-legal-counsel-issues-statement\">PC Invasion</a>. Much of it simply repeats what Martin said in his video, but the firm also insisted that no wrongdoing actually took place. \"It is important to understand that winners on the website are randomly determined by both algorithms and computer code. The odds of winning games played at CSGO Lotto are not more or less favorable to any players. The company has fail-safe measures in place to prevent any person and any player from independently changing or manipulating the outcomes of any games played,\" the statement says in part. \"CSGO Lotto finds it deeply troubling that statements against both the company and its owners are not supported by facts and lack a serious understanding of 'gambling,' as that term is legally defined. In this way, CSGO Lotto is materially different from its competitors who operate other game play websites that may, in fact, cross the line of legality.\" ",

        "contents": "CS:GO s popularity over the last several years has birthed an industry of independent skin gambling operations. Tens of thousands of people bet in-game items from CS:GO on these third-party websites, and their won and lost digital goods have real-world value within the Steam Community Market. Moral and legal murkiness surrounds these enterprises, many of which are based outside the US, and many of which are not licensed, regulated gambling entities. Though US law has begun to weigh in on fantasy sports gambling apps like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/sports/football/draftkings-fanduel-new-york-attorney-general-tells-fantasy-sites-to-stop-taking-bets-in-new-york.html?_r=0\"> DraftKings </a>, it has yet to address this less-visible extension of video game culture. <a href=\"http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/06/25/counter-strike-player-sues-valve-over-illegal-weapon-skin-gambling\"> A class-action claim </a> against Valve is one of the first signs that this issue will draw broader legal attention. In the meantime, segments of CS:GO s esports scene hold questionable relationships with these services. Teams profit directly from the in-game sales of team and player <a href=\"https://csgostash.com/containers/autograph-capsules\"> virtual stickers </a>, which are valid betting items. The availability of betting has unquestionably grown interest in CS:GO esports, and teams and leagues have received sponsorship from gambling websites. In January 2015 <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/new-evidence-of-counter-strike-global-offensive-match-fixing/\"> Valve banned seven players </a> after it became clear that members of Team iBUYPOWER had fixed a match, betting on their opponent and intentionally losing in order to win tens of thousands of dollars worth of CS:GO skins. Professional players, their managers, and teams organization staff, Valve wrote in response to the incident, should under no circumstances gamble on CS:GO matches, associate with high volume CS:GO gamblers, or deliver information to others that might influence their CS:GO bets. A StatTrak \"Frontside Misty\" AK-47, a popular skin. Other than these specific comments, Valve has not censured skin gambling websites or discouraged anyone from using them. In an April report by <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-virtual-guns-counterstrike-gambling/\"> Bloomberg </a>, a spokesperson for one of the most popular gambling websites, CSGO Lounge, said that Valve has communicated with them and provided technical support. The controversy surrounding skin gambling took a new, upsetting turn last weekend when it was revealed that two high-profile YouTubers had created and then <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/youtuber-admits-that-his-csgo-skin-betting-videos-were-rigged/\"> marketed a CS:GO gambling website </a> to their audiences on YouTube and social media without disclosing their co-ownership. Their videos showed them winning thousands of dollars worth of CS:GO skins on <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\"> CSGO Lotto </a>, portraying their success as luck. Why is CS:GO unique? Secondary markets have sprung up around many games that contain tradable items since the early days of eBay, and developers have grappled with these resellers in different ways. But CS:GO s situation is unprecedented: the near total focus of these third-party groups on turning CS:GO gun skins into tokens that can be used to play casino-like games and the fact that these outfits are unregulated and do not impose checks against the participant s age may be in violation of US law. By not publicly intervening, Valve has allowed gambling to become an inseparable aspect of CS:GO s culture. Four things allowed for the foundation and explosive growth of these third-party gambling websites: * The popularity of <strong>CS:GO</strong>, which boasts more than 10 million unique players (about as many copies as <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-breaks-10-million-players/\">; Overwatch </a> has sold on all platforms) and an esports viewership that rivals Dota 2. * CS:GO&#x2019;s <strong>item drop system</strong> which awards weapon skins and weapon cases at a controlled interval to anyone who plays. Cases contain contain gun and knife skins, but they must be opened with keys, which can be purchased on Steam for $2.49 or acquired via trade. * The <strong>Steam Community Market</strong>, a digital marketplace for 33 games, as well as Steam Community items (such as trading cards), where in-game items are sold and bought with real money from your Steam Wallet. * The <strong>Steam Trading API</strong>, which allows anyone to create third-party tools to manage item transactions on a large scale. How does skin gambling work?&#xA0; There s more than one way to gamble a skin. A multiplicity of CS:GO gambling websites exist, and most offer a unique gimmick or mechanism by which you bet and win items. <a href=\"http://betcsgo.org/\"> Betcsgo.org </a> lists more than 55 websites that offer some form of CS:GO skin gambling. A few examples are below. <strong>Esports betting</strong> In this nascent industry, CSGO Lounge is one of the oldest and most popular, allowing users to bet CS:GO items from their Steam inventories on CS:GO matches in leagues like the ESL and FACEIT. Users can bet up to $300 worth of items on a single match, although secondary Steam accounts can be used to bet beyond that limit. Winnings are based on odds, which change dynamically based on the ratio of bets between teams. If odds are 75-25, that would mean three people would have had to bet on the 75 percent and one on the 25 percent, a CSGO Lounge admin told me in 2014. Anyone with a Steam account can use CSGO Lounge, and per the website s <a href=\"https://csgolounge.com/rules\"> rules </a>, it s your responsibility to figure out if that s legal where you live: By placing a bet on CSGO Lounge you are confirming that you are in abidance with your country's laws which allow you to participate in skin-betting, the <a href=\"https://csgolounge.com/rules\"> rules </a> section of the website reads. This is generally 18 years of age or older, but make sure to check. If you don t claim your winnings within 21 days, CSGO Lounge keeps them. Like nearly all other skin gambling websites, CSGO Lounge uses Steam bot accounts they ve created to receive bets and distribute winnings. Users receive an invitation to trade items from a Steam account controlled by CSGO Lounge s automated system, which offers their winnings as a one-sided trade. <strong>Mystery boxes</strong> CS:GO itself presents players with tiny slot machines: weapon cases that you can pay $2.49 to unlock while you re within the game client. Websites like <a href=\"http://skincrates.com/\"> skincrates.com </a> replicate the excitement of opening these weapon cases but do so using their own, proprietary tokens and cases. It s a facsimile of the experience you have in-game, but with different outcomes and a different group taking your money. SkinCrates repackages individual CS:GO skins that they own into custom crates (not official CS:GO weapon cases) that you can pay to open on their website. $3 worth of SkinCrates credits, for example, allows you to open an AWP Crate, and you can take a chance at one of 24 different knives (of varying value and rarity) with $60 worth of credits. Like other CS:GO gambling outfits, Skincrates dresses itself in the art and aesthetic of CS:GO, using recolored images of cases and special forces characters to make its services feel more official. CSGOfast.com is another egregious example of this technique, where on its <a href=\"https://csgofast.com/#ladder\"> Top players </a> (i.e., gamblers) page it awards rank badges taken from CS:GO s competitive matchmaking to the users who have won the most value. <strong>Public pots</strong> This popular form of skin betting is arguably the most direct, as it s purely odds-based gambling with other players. On <a href=\"https://www.skinjoker.com/\"> skinjoker.com </a>, players deposit skins into a shared pot as a short time limit counts down, after which no more bets are accepted. The system picks a winner based on everyone s entries: the higher total value of the skins you bet, the greater your chance of winning the pot. <strong>Gambling games</strong> Another sub-category of gambling websites allow you convert your items into a proprietary currency for use in web-based versions of traditional games like poker, rock-paper-scissors, dice, or roulette. On <a href=\"https://www.csgolive.com/\"> csgolive.com </a>, you can play blackjack using chips converted from the value of your deposited skins. A link labeled Provably Fair on the website currently leads to nowhere. How many people are gambling? Conservatively, tens of thousands of people are gambling using CS:GO skins. Alexa.com gives csgolounge.com a global rank of 574, a measurement of its average daily visitors and pageviews over the last three months (for comparison, hulu.com ranks 294). In March 2016, 38 million people visited the site. CSGO Lounge s Steam group has more than half a million members. In an ESL One match earlier today between Fnatic and FaZe, 43,840 accounts bet 171,093 items. Csgofast.com tracks daily unique players on its front page, which today shows 17,500 players. Csgobig.com tells you how many dollars worth of CS:GO skins have been won that day; when I visited around dinnertime, it showed more than $1 million. How does Valve benefit? Skin gambling indirectly stimulates the Steam Market. Valve makes 5% off the sale of any Steam Market sale, but they take 15% of the sale of items from Valve games like CS:GO, Dota 2, and Team Fortress 2. If an AWP Asiimov sells for $30 on the market, Valve would take $4.50 item seller would receive $25.50. If the owner of that AWP gets bored of it, or the price rises significantly, they can re-list it on the Steam Market and Valve would again take 15% of the sale. In this way Valve benefits from the volume of transactions and the selling price of the items listed. Is this legal? There isn t a lot of legal precedent on virtual item gambling. Are skins money, virtual capital, or are they more like arcade tokens that these gambling websites accept like pinball machines? One of the few, somewhat comparable recent cases is <a href=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gameofwar.pdf\"> Mason v. Machine Zone </a>, in which a plaintiff alleged that the Casino area of Game of War, where players could bet in-game currency in order to receive rewards, constituted a gambling device, and that the $100 she lost was a result of unfair competition. The court didn t rule in Mason s favor, going so far as to call comparing the value of in-game virtual gold and in-game rewards to the value of real money a whimsical undertaking that has no place in federal court. Because Game of War doesn t offer payouts of real-world money, Mason had transformed her money into valueless play money, the court says. Plaintiff was not wagering with dollars, the decision reads, she was playing with virtual gold. Plaintiff acquired that gold in the gold store, where she exchanged her real-world currency for a nontransferable, revocable license to use virtual currency for entertainment purposes. At the moment of that antecedent transaction, Plaintiff s loss, if any, was complete: then and there she had swapped something of value (real money) for something of whimsy (pretend gold ). There are major differences between Game of War and CS:GO, especially the presence of an open digital market operated by Valve that provides pricing information on weapon skins in real money. But one small similarity is that secondary markets do exist for selling Game of War accounts for real-world money, a fact that the court didn t seem to give much weight. What she could not do is cash out of the game. In this respect, while GoW s Casino function aesthetically resembles classic games of chance, the underlying transaction is more akin to purchasing cinema or amusement park tickets. Consumers of such services pay for the pleasure of entertainment per se, not for the prospect of economic gain, the decision read. Some of the only legal insight on the topic came in an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4rep4f/we_are_bryce_blum_ryan_morrison_and_jeff_ifrah/\"> AMA </a> on /r/GlobalOffensive this week, where three lawyers who specialize in gaming, gambling, or esports offered their perspectives on the issues connected to CS:GO skin gambling. \"For my money,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eSportsLaw?lang=en\"> Bryce Blum </a> says of the likelihood that skin gambling will be considered gambling by the law, \"I think this is a no brainer because the secondary market is prominent, permitted to exist, and skins have widely known value. That being said, there isn't a case directly on point here so it's impossible to say for certain.\" Some YouTubers and streamers have turned their gambling into videos for their audiences. he question is whether the skins are a thing of value, adds Jeff Ifrah. Generally, in traditional gambling cases, this means cash or chips. Skins, even with secondary markets, hold their value because of the gaming, which puts it squarely in the virtual world, he continued, If the skins are virtual things of value, using them for gambling would be OK under most laws. Overall, their legal attitude is that betting doesn t necessarily need to banned in all forms, but that it needs more regulation and protections for participants. CSGO has grown to its current prominence in large part due to betting, and I don't think eliminating all skin betting is necessary or a smart move, writes Blum. We do however desperately need to eliminate the bad actors from the space. The types of fraud that came to the fore in the CSGO Lotto and CSGO Diamond situations are precisely what arises when betting sites operate without oversight or transparency. The entire industry needs to take a stand on this issue, not just Valve. CS:GO skin gambling operations are not in imminent legal danger, and there are no known suits against them at time of publication. Sports betting is illegal everywhere within the United States with the exception of Nevada, Oregon, Delaware, and Montana. Internet-based gambling is prohibited in all but three US states, even if you re older than 18. Unless Valve makes a public statement condemning the activities of these groups, or restricts use of its Steam Market API to groups that it vets, gambling will continue to be a morally and legally gray by-product of one of the world s most popular PC games that s accessible to anyone with a Steam account. We ll continue to cover this topic and update this article as new information emerges. ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\">CSGO</a> has a gambling problem. Valve is involved in a suit over whether CSGO's key-and-crate loot system and the accompanying skin market should be defined and regulated as gambling, while a handful of YouTubers <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lotto-investigation-uncovers-colossal-conflict-of-interest/\" target=\"_blank\">have been exposed as the owners</a> of a skin gambling site they promoted. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/youtuber-admits-that-his-csgo-skin-betting-videos-were-rigged/\" target=\"_blank\">Another confessed that his gambling wins were staged</a> in conjunction with the betting site. This has prompted airmchair lawyers to sit up straight and start dispensing their own dubious wisdom. What counts as gambling? When should we fire up the electric chair? I'm as guilty as anyone. Thankfully, three real lawyers Bryce Blum, Ryan Morrison and Jeff Ifrah <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4rep4f/we_are_bryce_blum_ryan_morrison_and_jeff_ifrah/\" target=\"_blank\">held an AMA on Reddit</a> to dissect the key issues. They often disagree, which should tell you that whatever lies ahead for betting in CSGO, it won't be a smooth ride. So, is skin gambling actual gambling in the eyes of the law? \"For my money,\" Blum (/u/esportslaw) says, \"I think this is a no brainer because the secondary market is prominent, permitted to exist, and skins have widely known value. That being said, there isn't a case directly on point here so it's impossible to say for certain.\" \"In our work,\" Ifrah (/u/ifrahlaw) contends, \"the question is whether the skins are a 'thing of value.' Generally, in traditional gambling cases, this means cash or chips. There is a recent court decision from Maryland Mason v. Machine Zone that stressed the distinction between virtual things of value and things of value with 'real world' value. I think this case will be instructive in the future. Skins, even with secondary markets, hold their value because of the gaming, which puts it squarely in the virtual world. If the skins are virtual things of value, using them for gambling would be OK under most laws.\" They're even further from consensus on whether the YouTubers at the heart of recent scandals are likely to face criminal proceedings. \"From my perspective,\" Blum says, \"it s pretty unlikely that the government will do anything here. Pretty much every government agency is understaffed and overworked. Whether or not a case is pursued is a matter of prioritization and allocation of limited resources. Remember that the fantasy sports industry was massive for years, but it took a highly public insider trading scandal and one of the largest ad buys in history to give the situation sufficient profile to warrant governmental action.\" \"I respectfully disagree with Bryce,\" Morrison (/u/VideoGameAttorney) says, \"and think jail time and/or criminal charges are a real possibility here. DAs go after juicy stories to build their careers, and this is that. Thousands upon thousands of kids tricked into spending money on a site that they lied about not owning. There will be one state that goes all in on this, and that's all it takes. I really believe that.\" And what about the Valve case? Does it have legs? \"I don't think the lawsuit against Valve will go anywhere,\" Morrison says, \"but it definitely has legal ground. While I expect it to settle quickly and not see a courtroom, keep the following in mind: \"Valve owns every single skin that exists. You don't buy skins, you buy a license to use the skins. \"Valve has been reported as helping to actually <em>run</em> these websites (specifically CSGO Lounge according to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-virtual-guns-counterstrike-gambling/\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg article</a>). \"Valve allows you to buy and sell skins on their own market, and allows unregulated gambling websites to use their API to operate with ease. \"So if you own every skin, help run the websites that gamble them, and then turn those skins into quick and easy cash... that's a recipe that some folks may call 'not wonderful.' For what they can do? They can stop letting these insanely popular websites use their marketplace so easily.\" ",

        "contents": "If you ve ever played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive you ve probably noticed that assault rifles are the weapons of choice for most players. The reasons are many. Not only do they look cool, but in the right hands they can turn the tide of any game. In this article I ll show you how to use assault rifles and hopefully it ll help you win more games on your road to the Global Elite. Why should you use assault rifles? The short answer is that, together with the AWP, they re the best weapons in the game. They re accurate and have great armor penetration, making them the foundation of CS. Pistols, SMGs and sniper rifles are used in different and very specific situations: in most rounds you ll find yourself using assault rifles. &#xA0;Which assault rifle should you use? By far the most popular ones are the <strong>AK-47</strong>, <strong>M4A4</strong> and <strong>M4A1-s</strong>, the latter being subject to a massive overhaul late last year. In an update in which many (including myself) thought the weapon would be rendered useless, both the M4A1-s armor penetration and rate of fire was lowered. The lowered rate of fire proved to make the weapon more accurate: it s a lot easier to control the spray than before. This, coupled with the fact that it has a silencer, has made sure the weapon is still being used even at the highest level of competitive CS:GO. If you can t afford one of the above mentioned weapons you can go for the <strong>FAMAS</strong> (CT) or the <strong>Galil AR</strong> (T) if your team decides to go for a buy round. They re both pretty accurate and has decent damage output. They are however inferior at long range and marginally worse at close range. &#xA0;Learn the spray patterns If you learn how to control the recoil of the most popular assault rifles you have a greater chance of coming out on top when it really matters. Teamplay might be an integral part of Counter-Strike, but you ll never reach your goals if you don t know the basics. And your work is never done. You need continuous practice if you want to maintain your skill level. Let s start with the T-side weapon of choice: the AK-47. This is what the spray looks like if you don t try to control the recoil. What can we make of this? Notice how the first two bullets go pretty straight. After that the bullets start gravitating towards the sky and to the left. After a while the pattern goes to the right and stays there for a while before it goes back to the left. Practice to move your mouse to counter the recoil and you should end up with something like this. Let s take a look at the M4s. The M4A4 s recoil pattern makes the bullets go straight up, then to the left, back to the right and then left again. Here s how it looks both when you just hold down the trigger and when you try to control it. The M4A1-s pattern is basically the same except it s a bit slower, and obviously stops after 20 bullets instead of 30. &#xA0;Long, medium and short range As you might know there are a few different techniques you can use when you shoot. There s the famous one-taps la ScreaM, the short bursts and then spraying. But when should you use each technique? As a rule of thumb you should almost never go for one-taps with the M4s because of how accurate the first three bullets are. Instead you should go for short bursts at long and medium range. With the AK-47, things are a little bit different. One bullet to the head and you ll score a kill. Therefore a few quick one-taps can do the trick at long range. At medium range I prefer to use three bullet bursts with the AK-47. The first two bullets will go in a straight line and for the third i pull my crosshairs slightly down. Like this: At short range it s almost always best to go for sprays. If you re good you can do some serious damage at medium range as well. That s all individual and what works for one player might not work for another and the other way around. One small piece of advice is that it s one thing to spray on a wall and another thing to spray down moving targets. Like Jordan n0thing Gilbert said on his stream, the most important part of spraying is to get the height right. If you can do that you ll find more success when you try to spray someone down. I suggest that you take a few minutes to watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3jAOcjIBfk\"> clip </a>. In the video he talks about how important the first few shots are. A big part of mastering any weapon in CS:GO is to aim properly. Subscribe to a map called <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&id=213240871\"> training_aim_csgo2 </a>. Settings for practicing spray control Practice on different distances. The main reason for this kind of practice is to get used to your sensitivity. I recommend that you turn off mouse acceleration. That way you ll be more consistent. If you can make things easier for yourself you should. I d also recommend a fairly low sensitivity. Even if one might argue that it d be better to learn how to master high sensitivity it s not realistic. Especially on long range and when you have to react really fast. The lower you go, the more precise you ll be. Even if you have really good muscle memory you won t be able to land those insane headshots under pressure if your sensitivity is too high. <strong>Find all of our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive guides here:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Train Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Train Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Support role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> <strong>Entry fragger role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> <strong>Lurker role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>AWPer role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-leader-guide/\"> <strong>Team leader guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-smg-guide/\"> <strong>SMGs guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/master-sniper-rifles-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Sniper rifles guide</strong> </a> ",

Which is awkward. Not only were the videos not marked as promotions, but the videos also promoted a website in which the creators had quite a significant stake.

As he explains in a video (embedded below), PsiSyndicate was approached by CS:GO betting site Steamloto, who provided him with valuable weapon skins to \"randomly\" unbox. PsiSyndicate then acted as if they were random wins, thus making the whole racket look very worthwhile for anyone keen on gambling CS:GO weapon skins. \"The idea was brought to me by Steamloto, they proposes rigging in return for a Dragon Lore, I just fell right into it,\" PsiSyndicate says, referring to an especially valuable CS:GO weapon skin. \"The total takings was $3200 in skins, Dragon Lore / Ruby, $1,200 ($4,000 really, $2,800 of my own skins) of which I gave away,\" he continued. Whether PsiSyndicate's experience is a one-off, or if it's quite a common phenomenon among streamers and YouTubers, isn't clear. He won't be doing it again, though. \"CSGO is a tempting, weird place for all CSGO YouTubers and Twitch streamers alike, I fell down a weird place and don't plan on going back there.

        "contents": "The recent success of G2 has marked one of the most exciting developments in professional CS. Barely scraping into the ESL Pro League finals in May, G2 shocked onlookers by dominating their group pool. After defeating Fnatic they went toe-to-toe against the world number one, Luminosity Gaming, in a thrilling five-match finale. Though LG took the crown in May, the ECS Finals in June provided the perfect opportunity for revenge, and this time the French did not falter. During the tournament, G2 s Adil ScreaM Benrlitom and Richard shox Papillon discussed the revitalisation of French CS. &#xA0;Headshot kings As a star player, adored by fans for his legendary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT0zLjXqMwg\"> one-taps </a>, Benrlitom presents a surprisingly reserved persona bordering on shy. Speaking after G2 s quarter final victory over NiP, discussion of his expectations is assured, but equally restrained. This quiet level of confidence is echoed by G2 s captain, Richard. Both men give the impression that they believe strongly in their team, but clearly understand the level of work needed make it to the top. Individually if we re gonna be really good, we can win against everyone, but if we don t play well individually, we can lose to anyone, says Adil. Right now we re more reliant on communication and individuals... we re trying to mix everything and find our own game style. We re still searching for it but we need some time and it s going well right now. Since the ESL Pro League we lost some matches in ELEAGUE against teams like NiP, mousesports and Gambit at the major qualification so that was pretty hard, Richard says. After this we just came back home and worked on what we needed to fix mistakes. At the moment I m pretty happy with the team because we re finding again the way we want to play. We still have a lot to improve of course because we need more experience, we re a young team but we re going in a good way. Photo credit: ECS &#xA0;Team mentality This shared ideology is core to G2, and reflects the long history between the players. Both men have had long careers in French CS, and much of that has been spent together. If one thing has been established by G2 s recent performance, it s that Richard and Adil, both players of phenomenal skill alone, combine to form one of CS:GO s most formidable double acts. The thing with me and ScreaM, it was back in 2010 in CS:Source, I saw his aim and realised he had definitely got talent, explains Richard. So in the same month we were creating a team and I wanted to pick him. I took under my wings and wanted to help him learn more about the game. Even if we managed to split after because, I mean we were all young you know and when you re very young it s hard. We were like 16, 18, something like this. Between him and me we always liked playing together. Not only outside the game everything is good, but inside because we have the same vision. Shox and me, we have been playing together for a long time, Adil says. He s always been really good, I had some good times as well and now we re feeling good in this team. That s how we work. The whole team... the relationship we have is really good actually, I mean we re not kids, we just like each other but some of us have known each other for ten years, six years, something like that so we really know each other and it s important to feel good outside the game also. Photo credit: ECS &#xA0;The French shuffle This team-wide positive approach is is core to G2 s survival as a French squad. Despite a dizzying amount of talent, French CS has always been hindered by near incessant roster changes, swapping players back and forth between teams. That s always been a problem in France, admits Adil. It s just a communication problem I guess, they re not being honest with each other, they re not trying to fix problems by talking. They think that by changing players it s good. It s good in the beginning but later you re always going to have problems and you re always going to have to fix them with talking. I think it s getting better now and I hope it ll get a lot better in the future. To be honest, the thing is, you know it s the French scene, Richard says. When everything is good, it s okay, but when things get bad some people want to try different things. I think we ll not have this problem because we all five have the same mentality and same goals. This is key because we had this same problem with EnVyUs when we had some problems we didn t fix them because we didn t talk. What people don t see behind the scenes is that even we have had some internal problems but we managed to speak and solve them. Since then our results have gotten directly better. Photo credit: ECS By ensuring good communication across the team, G2 have established an extremely dangerous roster, with SmithZz, RpK and boddy all offering standout moments at the ECS Finals. As captain, Richard is keen to highlight the rest of the team. For me it s really important, he says. A lot of people just see the scoreboard and the rating. What they don t see is that yeah, sometimes we re gonna get a double or triple kill, but that s because one of our teammates has just made the perfect flashbang and we re killing people that are blind. People don t see this so I m really happy this is improving. To have a good team, you need good chemistry, you can t have five fraggers, you have to have roles. People need to see what roles they play and people will realise how good they are. With strength in unity and victories over the best teams around, G2 have shot up the rankings, dragging France back to the limelight. If their recent form is maintained, G2 look to be serious contenders for the CS throne. ",

Learn more in </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-skin-gambling/\"><em> this article </em></a><em>.</em> <strong>Update:</strong> The message warning Steam users logging into the CSGO Lotto site that it could be engaging in phishing, scamming, spamming, or delivering malware in no longer in place. The warning was initially created by a Steam moderator, not Valve itself. <strong>Original story:</strong> CS:GO's weapon skin lottery is in the spotlight again with the discovery that two YouTubers who promoted the skin-gambling site CSGO Lotto in the guise of 'content' are, in fact, its owners. Valve is already embroiled in a class action lawsuit over whether its crate-and-key system of skin drops and the ability to indirectly trade skins for cash should be classed and regulated as gambling. This case is more obviously egregious. YouTubers Trevor 'TmarTn' Martin and Tom 'ProSyndicate' Cassell ran a number of videos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb3TS-56Yw&list=PLwiTZDxPg_I2ETxKLx-m1gpHRmUyIhWTz\" target=\"_blank\">several now set to private</a> in which they would gamble weapon skins on CSGO Lotto and win. Sometimes they would win big, resulting in videos with titles like \"HOW TO WIN $13,000 IN 5 MINUTES\". That reads like a banner ad I would avoid, and research into <a href=\"http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&directionType=Initial&searchNameOrder=CSGOLOTTO%20P150000974870&aggregateId=domp-p15000097487-864ff1fc-2baf-48c7-96e5-32ffb0ce6356&searchTerm=CSGO%20Lotto&listNameOrder=CSGOLOTTO%20P150000974870\" target=\"_blank\">CSGO Lotto's incorporation details</a> by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4IuXz-cux1M\" target=\"_blank\">HonorTheCall</a> revealed its president to be none other than Trevor Martin. Its VP? Thomas Cassell. The discovery that a number of content creators were failing to disclose sponsorships or promotions caused uproar quite recently. It's illegal, after all. To actually own the company being promoted a gambling site, no less and not disclose that is a step further. It also calls into question the legitimacy of the gambles portrayed in their videos. Responding to the revelation in a vlog, Martin says, \"This is something that has never been a secret\". However, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_8fU2QG-lV0\" target=\"_blank\">extensive research by h3h3 Productions</a> failed to find any instance of his interest in CSGO Lotto being declared. Indeed, in an earlier video Martin announces, \"We found this new site called CSGO Lotto so I'll link it down in the description if you guys want to check it out. We were betting on it today and I won a pot of like $69 or something like that, so it was a pretty small pot, but it was like the coolest feeling ever. I ended up following them on Twitter and stuff, and they hit me up and they're talking to me about potentially doing like a skin sponsorship ...\" Martin appears to be using \"they\" to refer to a company he himself owns. Defending himself against the allegations, Martin continues, \"The problem with would be if I didn't divulge that information, and I do: you can look in the descriptions of every single one of my CSGO Lotto videos ...\" However, a search of Google's archives for 'HOW TO WIN $13,000' <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V-dS74WJTw\" target=\"_blank\">using Wayback Machine</a> reveals that the sentence, \"Video made possible by CSGOLotto,\" was added after the video was uploaded. Others still lack the (fairly flaky) disclosure. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOOPy5iidP4\" target=\"_blank\">Speaking to YouTuber Scarce</a> via Twitter, Martin has also said, \"I do own the site now, I didn't back then. At that point it was a feeler video to see if my viewers would enjoy that type of content and whether or not I should invest in the business.\" This also appears to be false: Martin's name can be found on <a href=\"http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ConvertTiffToPDF?storagePath=COR%5C2015%5C1208%5C30720303.tif&documentNumber=P15000097487\" target=\"_blank\">CSGO Lotto's articles of incorporation</a> as the incorporator. The evidence appears damning and, given that both the UK's Advertising Standards Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission have previously slammed creators for failing to disclose product placements, the issue could escalate beyond the confines of YouTube. Steam is already advising users attempting to access CSGO Lotto that \"The URL you are attempting to log in to has been blocked by our moderators and staff. This site may be engaged in phishing, scamming, spamming, or delivering malware.\" ",

        "contents": "There are four different sniper rifles in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They re all useful, and they can all help you win rounds. The key thing you need to know, aside from how to use them effectively, is when you should be using each one. Why snipe at all? Is it worth investing in a sniper rifle at all? Why not just buy another assault rifle instead? Sniper rifles work very differently compared to other weapons in the game. Each one excels in its own area. I d say that it s absolutely worth investing in a sniper rifle every now and then, as long as you know what you want to achieve. Maybe you want to hold down an area of the map and kill the first guy who peeks. If you suspect that they might have an AWP you should get one as well. Why? Because the AWP kills you with a single hit. That s one of the reasons why AWP has become the most popular sniper rifle in the game: it straightforwardly counters all the other sniper rifles. Maybe you don t expect them to have an AWP and you want to hold down a narrow corridor where they likely will try to smoke you out? Then an auto-sniper might be the gun you re looking for. And sometimes it s not just about getting kills. You might be low on cash and want to peek certain spots as safely as possible: behind the van on Mirage, for instance. Then the SSG 08 might be the right choice. You can jump and still shoot accurately when compared to the other sniper rifles, but you will need to land a headshot to kill an enemy with one bullet unless they re close and didn t buy armour. The upside is that the SSG 08 allows you to move around almost as fast as you can without a weapon equipped, making it the ultimate weapon to use when you want to peek for information and stay alive at the same time. When should you snipe? First of all you need enough money. The AWP costs $4750, the SCAR-20 and G3SG1 both cost $5000 each and the SSG 08 is yours for $1700. When you use a weapon that expensive (SSG 08 excluded) you really, really want to buy armor as well. Sometimes, when you think it s crucial in order to win the game, you can buy an AWP without armor, also known as a glass cannon. Like I mentioned earlier the AWP kills enemies with a single bullet. That s the key to glass cannons being viable: kill them before they get a chance to shoot back. That s not the case with the other sniper rifles, however, which is why I almost never use them without armor. Next, let s look at the kill rewards. A kill with the AWP will give you $100 and with all the other sniper rifles you get the normal $300. What this means is that if you use the AWP you ll not only get $200 less per kill, but with each kill you ll deny your own team that same amount of money. As you can see it s pretty important that you have a good reason to buy an AWP. In order for the other team to lose as much money as your team does when you die you need to kill either another AWPer or two riflers. You can t however only look at numbers. At the end of the day you need to win 16 rounds. How you do that is up to you, but it s a lot easier if you maintain a healthy economy throughout the game. Where should you snipe? Obviously you can find yourself in a favorable position by being creative and snipe from unexpected positions, but there are a few questions you should ask yourself first. Do I have a backup plan? Make sure you can back off safely in case you miss. Your weapon costs a lot of money and you won t help your team win the game if you re dead. Am I likely to win the duel if they have a sniper on the other side? Practice a lot and get comfortable with all the angles you might need to peek. Come prepared! Here are some examples of spots I like when using different sniper rifles: By the van on Mirage. Excellent spot to play with the SSG 08. You can peek B-apartments and stay relatively safe at the same time. This is a spot where I like to use an auto-sniper. Most teams smoke lower before pushing, in which case I can spam the smoke and hopefully pick up a kill or two and stay safe at the same time. When I play from here I like to have a teammate playing around the bomb train peeking upper. After I ve spammed the smoke I m ready to assist my teammate from far back, using the long distance to my advantage. Ask a teammate to throw a flashbang over the roof towards long and use your AWP to take control over the area. Practice a bit so that you aim at the right spot when you come around the corner. That way all you have to do is to click and you should be able to score the kill. You should practice how to use angles to your advantage no matter what weapons you use, but it s even more important when you ve invested in a sniper rifle. It s been little over a year since Valve lowered movement speed while scoped in when using the AWP, which means you now have to move around the corner and then scope if you want to be able to fire as fast as possible. Practice the technique, however, and eventually you ll master it and wreck everyone on the server. <strong>Find all of our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive guides here:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Train Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Train Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Support role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> <strong>Entry fragger role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> <strong>Lurker role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>AWPer role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-leader-guide/\"> <strong>Team leader guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-smg-guide/\"> <strong>SMGs guide</strong> </a> ",

        "contents": "Photo credit: ECS Jordan n0thing Gilbert Often reserved and camera-shy, professional gamers can make for unconventional interviewees. Cloud9 s outspoken and cheerful Jordan n0thing Gilbert is the antithesis of this. Backstage at the ECS Finals in London it s clear Jordan is a man who everyone knows, and who knows everyone, stopping regularly to chat or break a joke with players, casters and crew. After their victory over the Danish Astralis, Jordan sat down to share his views on North American CS and the weight of competing for his nation s hearts. &#xA0;The state of NA Despite his youthful exuberance, Jordan is actually one of the most experienced faces in the North American scene, and as captain of Cloud9 he faces a lot of pressure for the team to perform. The rise of Luminosity Gaming has rocked the American scene, and while C9 no longer hold the top spot, they see LG s story as an inspiration. I think it takes away some of our excuses, says Jordan. Because it shows that a team who not only came to North America without being ranked in the top ten, then also grinded their way to the top ten. That just goes to show that if you re hungry, if you re passionate and a tight-knit group of guys that really works together then teamwork is well there s no I in team right? It s actually pretty funny, I set my desktop background to a picture of Fallen s bedroom because they had to share a bed, him and Fer, and I literally have a big bedroom out in Cali. I used it as motivation because those guys came in and showed us that there s no excuse if you can be mentally strong and work hard as a team you can achieve anything. With the likes of Team Liquid, Counter Logic Gaming and TeamSoloMid all vying for attention, NA CS has entered one of it s most contested periods, making for exciting viewing. American audiences dominate online, comprising a huge portion of discussion on sites such as HLTV and the Global Offensive subreddit. While this gives NA teams an enormous support base, it also presents a onus for success many players struggle to handle. One of the toughest things in North America is the weak mentalities across the scene, Jordan begins. I feel like a lot of NA teams lose the psychological battle. In terms of mechanical skill the Europeans aren t dominating us, it s not like they have the best 3-point shooters in basketball. Most of it comes down to overall talent in teamwork and decision making. It s great to see more North American teams competing because we have that mechanical skill, we just have to up that psychological game. If we get there then the conversation can end and the stigma can go away. Photo credit: ECS &#xA0;Haters gonna hate The ever-present divide between North American and European CS the former often struggling to compete in spite of a vast player spectrum and monetary support has dogged the NA scene for years. American fans expect victory, so when things aren t going well, playing for one of your country s top hopes can be grueling. Far from being limited to Cloud9, the internet is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_LnPzRtv3Q\"> rife </a> with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvB-t71lys\"> mockeries </a> of North American failure. While the great majority is in good humour, there is also a significant amount of aggression. It takes a certain mindset to realise that there s gonna be a lot of supporters and a lot haters, says Jordan. gathered a lot of fans over the summer who enjoy watching our streams, so when they see us play if we don t perform up to the standard they re used to watching then they like to jump on us. I can t blame them for being upset but there s obviously a lot of immaturity. You have to kind of ignore that and hope it doesn t affect any members of the team. The contrast between streaming and competition performances isn t an easy thing to convey to viewers, particularly those younger or new to the game. When individuals draw huge streaming audiences, it becomes very easy to disappoint on the stage. That s shroud s biggest problem, Jordan says of his teammate. Because people on his stream watch him dominate singlehandedly. And the truth is, he doesn t care on his stream, he s having fun and purposely not playing like he would in a match. People are very hard on him because he s on reddit all the time with stream highlights. That crosses over into competition and people criticize him. A lot of it stems from jealousy but there are real fans who just want him to succeed. Photo credit: ECS &#xA0;Positive communication The semi-anonymity and speed of services like Twitter can lead to a real disconnect in people s attitudes compared to face-to-face interaction. Online abuse is in no-way unique to esports, but it remains an enormous issue in the competitively-minded landscape. It s crazy to me that when I m on Twitter or anything and people are talking crap about me or my team, Jordan says. I reply to them and say hey, why would you say that and can you elaborate on your point? After that first malicious statement they say hey my bad I didn t mean it bro. I just wish you d played better. People don t realise that just because you re on twitter or behind a screen, there s no facade here, you re still a person just throwing words in the air. The problem clearly frustrates Jordan, especially without an easy solution in sight. Nevertheless, with more outspoken and respectful players as role models, there is always the chance the community will evolve. I hope people will start to take more seriously what they re saying, Jordan says. Even you and your friends can get confused texting each other, let alone a stranger. How do you expect people to not misconstrue things ? I just think people should start to be more respectful and thoughtful with the way we speak on the internet. As Counter-Strike s audience continues to grow, It s a lesson many could stand to learn from. ",

All of them except the P90 have a kill bonus of $600, which is twice as much as kills with pistols or assault rifles. Only shotguns offer better bang for your buck, with $900 per kill. While shotguns can be very effective at short range or in tight corridors, however, you ll find yourself in a bad position when either taking or retaking a bomb site. For this reason, SMGs offer a better deal most of the time. One thing to remember, particularly on the T side, is to work together during this crucial round. If the CTs have bought Five-Sevens, for instance, they might headshot you before you get in close. This results in a valuable gun lost and a chance for them to win the round. &#xA0;When to use each SMG The <strong>MP9</strong> is exclusive to the CTs. It does low damage and has poor armor penetration but only costs $1250. However, it s easy to control while moving around and has insanely high rate of fire. Even if every bullet does little damage on its own, you can easily melt an unarmored enemy. Against armored enemies, the key is to stay very close. If you win the pistol round but the Ts managed to plant the bomb, they re likely to save in the second round in order to go for a full buy the round after. In this scenario the MP9 is a great choice. Just make sure you have a teammate ready to clean up in case you get overrun. The MP9 is also good for aggressive play. The T counterpart to the MP9 is the <strong>MAC-10</strong>. At $1050 it s the cheapest SMG in the game. Its properties are pretty much the same as the MP9 s, which makes it an excellent weapon to use if you re the first player in when you attack. You create distraction and spray down enemies who happen to be too close to you. This creates more space for your teammates with more powerful weapons to clean up the site. The <strong>MP7</strong> ($1700) has slightly lower rate of fire than the MP9 and MAC-10, but its first bullet accuracy is a little higher, making it possible to strafe and burst heads at medium range. Other than that you should use it like you use the SMGs above. It is a bit heavier, which slows you down to 220 units per second as opposed to 240 for the MP9 and MAC-10. You ll rarely use the MP7 as it s an awkward mix of the cheap SMGs and the UMP-45. It s more effective to have some players go for the UMP-45 and others the MP9 and MAC-10 than to go for a hybrid. The <strong>UMP-45</strong> is a badass weapon. If it weren t enough that it does a lot of damage and has great armor penetration, it also fires at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxnN05vOuSM\"> 666 </a> RPM. It s considerably slower than all of the above mentioned weapons, but it s a lot more accurate at medium range. If you expect your enemies to buy armor, the UMP-45 is an excellent choice. It costs $1200, which is insanely cheap considering you can hold on to it going into the first weapon round. The P90 is by far the best SMG when it comes to killing enemies, especially armored ones. It does however cost $2350 and only gives you $300 per kill, which makes it a good choice for those rounds when your team wants to buy full but one player can t afford armor and an assault rifle. I strongly recommend that you use the $600-bonus SMGs in the second round even if you can afford something more expensive. &#xA0;SMGs on the first gun round This topic has been widely discussed within the competitive scene. If you ve won all rounds leading up to the first gun round, the other team will go for a full buy. Should you keep your SMG or upgrade to an assault rifle? In my opinion it s often wise to stick to your SMG. Why? Because the more consecutive rounds you lose, the more money you get at the start of a new round (this caps out at $3400). The first round you lose will give you $1400, which isn t a lot. There are two possible outcomes of the first gun round: you either win or you lose. If you win, that means you ll get $600 per kill and you won a round without investing in a new weapon. If you lose you still get $600 for every kill you get, but more importantly: the other team wins. Because you didn t buy an assault rifle you ll have more than enough to buy one following that lost round. If you manage to win that round it means the other team s economy has been reset and they ll have to force buy or eco. Basically, keeping your SMG going into the first gun round is a low risk, high reward gamble. <strong>Find all of our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive guides here:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Inferno Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cache Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Overpass Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Cobblestone Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Train Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Train Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Mirage Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> <strong>Dust2 Terrorist guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>Support role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> <strong>Entry fragger role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> <strong>Lurker role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> <strong>AWPer role guide</strong> </a> <strong> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-leader-guide/\"> <strong>Team leader guide</strong> </a> ",

        "contents": "The latest <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2016/06/14766/\">update</a> to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> includes the first in a series of planned improvements to the game's audio. The Negev, M249, and Mag7 have all had their sound effects punched up, and the smoke grenade sound has been changed to make it more distinct as well. But there's also an entirely new effect that's been added, a ratcheting sound signaling that the current magazine is just about empty. And that, according to <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2016/06/14766/\">Kotaku</a>, has made some hardcore players awfully unhappy. The complaints arise from the fact that, with this sound cue, it's no longer necessary to keep track of the number of bullets your enemy has fired in order to know when it's safe to stick your head out; instead, you can just wait until you hear the tell-tale click. That lowers the skill ceiling of the game, as this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4oauhg/the_addition_of_the_lowammo_sound_cue_is/\">Reddit thread</a> puts it, because you no longer require experience or familiarity with in-game firearms to know when your enemy has run dry: You just need to listen. But that's maybe not as straightforward as it sounds. It's not as though a flashing neon sign will appear on your screen when the sound is triggered, and you'll need to be quite close to your enemy to actually hear it, as YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vi5qaQvkU8\">Dinoswarleaf</a> demonstrates. So it may be of limited value to begin with, and as one Redditor points out, most players aren't actually out there counting bullets in the middle of a digital firefight. It reminds me a bit of the famous ping sound made by clips ejecting from the Second World War-era M1 Garand rifle: Legend has it that the noise was a <a href=\"http://www.usmilitariaforum.com/forums/index.php?/topic/139350-the-myth-of-the-deadly-m1-garand-ping/\">deadly defect</a> that signaled an empty weapon, but the reality is that it could very rarely be heard, and had no real value even when it was. Whether or not it actually makes a significant change to the skill ceiling, the reaction to the sound has been intense, and has led to calls for a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4ob8j2/we_need_a_public_beta_client_before_introduce_a/\">CS:GO public test realm</a>, so Valve can give these ideas a trial run before granting them to/inflicting them on the full player base. Valve hasn't yet commented on the complaints and the sound effect remains. Give it a listen in the short video clip below. ",

        "contents": "Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson With the recent ESL Pro League Finals taking place at the O2 and the Esports Championship Series to conclude in the SSE Arena Wembley later this month, it s clear that UK Counter-Strike is on the rise. At the ESL Finals, two of the UK s most recognisable CS casters, <strong>Henry HenryG Greer</strong> and <strong>Lauren Pansy Scott</strong>, shared their thoughts on watching their home scene develop. Television vs. streaming HenryG Henry &#x2018;HenryG&#x2019; Greer is a caster/analyst for Global Offensive, usually partnered with the Canadian Matthew &#x2018;Sadokist&#x2019; Trivett. Though the UK scene is only just finding its feet in comparison to the mainland majors of Cologne and Katowice, this wasn t always the case. In the days of Global Offensive s predecessor, Source, the UK was up there with the best, fielding mighty teams like London Mint, Birmingham Salvo and 4Kings. While most tournaments at the time were smaller grassroots events, the Championship Gaming Series of 2007 hoped to up the ante with a bigger, more professional environment, acting as part of a push to have CS shown on national television. As a player for London Mint, Henry was directly involved in the first real drive, and subsequent failure, of mainstream esports in Britain. They put hundred and hundreds of thousands of pounds into it and obviously we weren t ready for it at that point, says HenryG. This was when I was playing, we got flown over to America and we got to play in these amazing leagues. We played two seasons and it turned out no one really watched it in the UK, and this was prime time TV... It was very clear that esports wasn t quite ready for the UK market then. While television may have seemed like the logical end goal ten years ago, the advent of streaming services such as Twitch has completely revolutionised esports media, freeing providers from the constraints of standard broadcasting services. Beyond the tournaments themselves, many players run successful (and lucrative) personal streaming services. For the dedicated, this offers the chance to directly connect with and support their favourite players. Pansy Lauren &#x2018;Pansy&#x2019; Scott is an ESL-employed caster for Global Offensive as well as other titles such as Battlefield, World of Tanks and Dirty Bomb. Originally back in the day, if you wanted to get to know these players it was through frag movies where you d watch one clip and be like that person is awesome , Lauren says. I think it s so great that you can be so personable with the players now. You can go to their Twitch chat, you can go and talk to them. Back when I started playing I thought well, I ll probably never get to speak to this player . Now I can go and subscribe to them and they ll probably be quite thankful and humble. you had to have the game installed and connect through that to watch, says Henry. Getting 5000 viewers was a big deal. Selling that to a large sponsor company is difficult. Twitch has made that accessible. Everyone can watch on their phone or laptop wherever you are in the world. I feel like that s the reason esports has got to where it has. As for for television? We just don t need it Henry says. We re so past that, why is it the ultimate goal? We re not restricted by adverts, we re not governed or restricted. We do our own thing. London calling As competitive gaming continues to soar in popularity, the changes are finally starting to take place, with dedicated UK arenas being established by both Gfinity and ESL. Clearly testing the waters, early events saw CS:GO sharing space with other titles such as Call of Duty and Super Smash Bros Melee at Dreamhack London. Since then the success of competitions like the ESL Pro League Finals have sent a clear signal: the UK has a committed audience for CS, and they are as passionate as they come. The UK having events like this, pulling in an audience without any other games, I love that, Lauren says. It s a unique thing and it seems to be getting better and better. CS is a massive thing in this space and it s dominating it pretty well. The audience is actually very unique, very different and I love that about them. You get a different vibe at different events you go to and I think the CS one has a hell of a lot of personality and it s awesome to see it here in London. Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson Gaming as a whole in the UK has had this stigma attached to it in the sense that it s quite nerdy and geeky, says Henry. But now people are starting to realise that it s actually quite a cool thing to do, it s actually quite exciting. With these kind of events we re raising awareness slowly but surely. People travel every weekend to see their favourite football teams, and now we re having that same thing for their favourite esports players, he continues. I think that s really cool. We re building up personalities and getting celebrities. It s all coming together through platforms like Twitch. Where are the UK teams? CS:GO broadcasting is overflowing with British talent. From Duncan Thorin Shields to Alex machine Richardson, you re all but guaranteed to see a UK face at any large event. Despite this, the UK has been painfully slow to establish itself in hosting tournaments. It s hard not to think that this is, in large, due to the lack of any presence from a local team. While the ESL audience showed no end of love for the French G2, a home side could draw an entirely different level of attention. Despite this it has been difficult to draw interest in sponsor support for a UK side. As a former player, this is clearly a topic close to Henry s heart. The problem with the UK CS:GO scene right now is that there are great players, but there are no great teams, Henry explains. You can tell the fans are hungry for it. They want their hometown heroes. They want their Fnatics, their NiPs like the Swedes have. I mean you look at teams like Virtus.pro, even when they re losing at Katowice they have the whole crowd behind them. That s what the UK wants. I had my own company and set up a British team to go to events and we sent them to Dreamhack London, continues Henry. That was the first time a British team had made it to a big event. They took down the Australian Team Renegades. In London, taking down one of the bigger names for the events, it was a fairytale story. The problem is, once we finished that event we had nothing else to play for. We hadn t been invited to any big events and the team stagnated and dropped off. That was about a year ago and the scene has changed so much since then.\" The problem with the UK CS:GO scene right now is that there are great players, but there are no great teams Valve has since introduced the Minor system in order to encourage and nurture smaller teams. Accepting only sides which have not previously participated in Majors, the Minors offer both a $50,000 prize pool and the chance to compete in the offline Major qualifiers. So with the support finally in place, and increasing attention being diverted to hosting, is it finally time for a stable UK side to emerge? On that front, the jury is still out. I hope so, offers Lauren. I won t say it s going to be any time soon if I m honest. I think there s still a long way to go. There are some incredibly talented players, it s just that the UK scene has a horrible history of rotating the same players in and out of lineups. Someone doesn t get on, or there s no support. They don t want to put in the work without the money being there. There s no middle ground for it. I think eventually the younger scene will break in, they ll get there and make it, but it s a long way. When my team was playing we didn t have , says Henry. So I feel like maybe not 2016, but 2017 we ll have something, just one team we can be proud of. They don t have to be winning events, just to be competitive. ",

        "contents": "We ve reached the fifth and final article in this series on the different roles within teams in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This time I ll talk about the in-game leader and the various approaches you might take to captaining your squad to victory. Different types of in-game leaders As I see it there are three distinct types of in-game leader and they all have their pros and cons. The first is the leader who spends a lot of time coming up with meticulously-planned executes, or set strats . The good thing about this style is that the entire team understands what you re going to do and the chances of your push to be well timed and executed is a lot higher than if you only <em>kind of </em>know what to do. The downside is that you can t know for sure what the enemy team will do. They might decide to push a key area of the map and make things difficult for you. One way to deal with this issue is to plan for different potential threats: if they do that we re doing this. If not, we re doing this instead. Another downside is that it is easier to read a team that constantly goes for set strats. The second style that comes to mind is the kind of leader who likes to run a lot of default rounds where you spread out across the map and gather information before you decide which site to attack and how. With this style you ll rarely run into stacked sites. If done properly you ll almost always attack the weaker side of the map. There are, again, some downsides to this approach. First of all, it takes excellent communication within the team to pull it off. Secondly, your pushes won t be as coordinated as a team that s spent hours running set strats on empty servers. Another risk is that you ll get picked off one by one and end up not being able to go for a proper push at all. And then we have the third style, if you can call it a distinct style: a combination of the styles mentioned above. Sometimes you ll go for slow defaults and sometimes you ll think you have the read on your opponents and mix things up by going for a set strat. Your team&#x2019;s ambition and map pool When you form a team it s important that you all share the same ambition. If one player wants to play a few games to wind down after a stressful day and another one wants to win international LAN tournaments, then you have a problem. Things will go a lot smoother if you re all on the same page. CS:GO is a game that takes time to learn and you can t do everything at once. Let s say you have a team that practices three times per week for a couple of hours. If that team tries to include all seven maps in its map pool they ll get to practice each map once or twice per week. Needless to say, that s not going to help them win that online FACEIT tournament you ve got your sights on. Most leagues and most tournaments use a system in which you take turns banning and picking maps. Unless you play a best of five (which is rare) you ll have at least two bans, meaning that you can have a map pool of five maps and guarantee that you won t play any of the maps you don t practice. Bear in mind that five maps is a pretty large map pool for any team. You can go for four maps and pray that you won t have to play the maps you don t practice. But which maps should you include in your map pool? That depends on a lot of factors. First of all you need to look at what your strengths are. Maybe you have a sick AWPer that you can play around. Then Dust2 might be a map to consider. I d say that a good approach is a mix of what you think could work in theory and how games actually tend to go. Sometimes you have a strong record on, say, Cobblestone, but you don t really know why. Simply being successful on a map is as good a reason to include it in your map pool as any. General advice I ve been an in-game leader on and off for over a decade and I ve played under in-game leaders with varying degrees of experience. One thing I ve noticed that almost all new in-game leaders struggle with is to know what to say at the start of a round. The more I ve played the more I ve come to realize that it s not always necessary to have a detailed plan every time your team spawns in. Call a default setup, take your time and get a feel for what kind of defense the opposing team is running. It is however crucial that you come up with a plan at some point. A bad plan is better than no plan in most cases. If you re new to in-game leading you can try to start planning for the next round towards the end of the current round. Keep a mental note of how the economy s looking. Let s say you ve lost two rounds in a row and you re about to lose a third one. That means that unless you get the plant you and your teammates will get $2400 next time you spawn. What does that mean? Can you afford to buy? Should you tell your team to save $2000 so that you ll end up with at least $4900 each the round after? That leads me to my next piece of advice: try to practice one aspect of your in-game leading at a time if you re new, or it s bound to feel overwhelming. You might focus on you mid-round calls in one game, and then managing the team s economy in the next. It takes time, but as you improve in different areas you ll gradually start to feel that it comes more naturally to you. My third piece of advice is pretty simple. The first time you want to come up with strats for your team, I d recommend you to either get inspired by others or downright steal stuff from pro teams. Watch demos and ask yourself why that team decided to use <em>that</em> smoke at <em>that</em> time. The more you steal, the more inspired you ll be to come up with strategies that are more suitable to the players you have on your team. Mid-round calls Making good mid-round calls can win you games. Listen to what your teammates say and try to keep track of all the information you have to give yourself a better chance of making good decisions. If you re new this can be tricky because it s a balance. You don t want your individual game to suffer too much, but at the same time your team needs someone to make the calls. Let s say you re in a two-versus-two situation on Cache and you play the terrorist side. Both of your players are in mid and you know for a fact that there s a guy on A, because your other teammate just died in A-main. What s the right call? Obviously it depends on what weapons you have, how much time you have left and if your opponents have an AWP or not. But just for the sake of making this example, we ll ignore all of that. The right call in this situation is to quickly go through the vent over to B. You know there s an enemy on A and there s a possibility that there s an enemy on B. That other enemy might as well be in Z-connector or over at A with his friend. If you have to choose between going onto a site where you know there s an enemy and a site where there <em>might</em> be an enemy you should almost always go for the latter. The information that you have is not limited to what you ve seen and heard this round. You might for example know that the other team managed to save an AWP. Depending on what your plan is you may want to either try to find him or stay away from him. Either way, if you can t see him in mid and he doesn t appear to be peeking on A, chances are he s on B. The money system If you want to succeed as an in-game leader it s crucial that you know when to eco, when to quasi buy (to buy but save enough money to be able to buy up the next round) and when to force buy. You ll have to try out different things to see what works for you and your team, but <a href=\"http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Money\">this page</a> is a great resource when learning the different rewards. Just make sure you scroll down to the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive section. Watch the pros play As you might know, the Swedish team Ninjas in Pyjamas were extremely dominant during the first year of CS:GO. They went 87-0 in maps won on LAN, a record that probably won t be beaten, ever. After that first period, the team dropped off and gradually got worse up until recently. Admittedly they won a Major in 2014 but they still looked a little shaky. How can a team with that much individual skill go from being completely dominant to not even be considered a top 10 team? The meta game evolved while NiP stayed the same. Just before the MLG Columbus Major earlier this year they hired Bj rn THREAT Pers as their new coach. Because of visa issues he had to stand in as a player for Jacob pyth Mouruj rvi in that tournament. Like expected they weren t close to winning, but something had changed. They looked more structured and you could tell they d been talking things over. Fast forward a month to Dreamhack Malm , where they played with the full line-up. The tournament was just as stacked with top teams as a major. Now you could definitely tell they had improved. They went on to win the entire thing and this time it wasn t a fluke run. The reason they won was because of their new calm and collected style with great mid-round calls. I highly recommend that you go over to <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\">HLTV.org</a> and download a few of NiP s demos from that tournament and compare the games to how they looked before they added THREAT. Another great strategist is Gabriel FalleN Toledo from Luminosity. He s probably the player who s had the biggest impact on the game in recent times. The way he s transformed the Brazilian CS:GO scene in such a short time is incredible. It started with a team called Keyd Stars who qualified for the ESL One Katowice major in early 2015 where they showed a lot of promise and finished in the top eight. At that time no-one thought Brazil would end up being this powerhouse of a nation in CS:GO. Now not only has he won the MLG Columbus major with Luminosity but he s also helped out the guys in Tempo Storm with the strategic aspect of the game and as a result they re up and coming. According to <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/2016/may/23/\">HLTV.org s latest ranking</a> Luminosity sits at number one, and Tempo Storm at ten. Needless to say, FalleN is one of the all time greats when it comes to in-game leading. Watch some of Luminosity s games and you ll feel inspired to do great things with your own team. <strong>Find all of our Counter-Strike: Global Offensive guides here: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\"> Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\"> Inferno Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\"> Cache Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\"> Cache Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\"> Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\"> Overpass Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\"> Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\"> Cobblestone Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\"> Train Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\"> Train Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\"> Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\"> Mirage Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\"> Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\"> Dust2 Terrorist guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> Support role guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\"> Entry fragger role guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\"> Lurker role guide </a> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/be-a-better-awper-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\"> AWPer role guide </a> ",

        "contents": "Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson Friday s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/world-esports-association-formed-by-esl-and-pro-teams/\">announcement</a> of the World Esports Association, WESA, could ve gone smoother. A leaked logo earlier in the week prompted widespread speculation, and even in the immediate aftermath of the official announcement it was tough to find a clear explanation of what this new sports federation would actually do. In part this is the fault of WESA itself. I was at the launch in London, and my experience was of a number of good ideas struggling to make themselves heard above the furore. There are a bunch of different ways to say we want to create a more stable and professional conversation around esports , after all, and we ve started FIFA is only one of them although it just happens to be the one that makes people think about corruption and bad governance. It feels like they ve been fighting fires from minute one as a consequence of mishandling a few key points. On the other hand, the way the conversation around WESA has developed demonstrates, with bittersweet irony, why something like WESA is necessary. The esports community likes to hold court in Reddit and on Twitter. YouTube and the press are used as soundboards that start public fights elsewhere on social media. And I m not just talking about fans: the last few days have seen senior industry figures including members of WESA get drawn into a mess of he-said-she-said. This is an industry used to conducting its affairs through DMs and private Skype channels, where transparency (i.e, a leaked chat log) is usually a consequence of a fight getting out of hand. WESA s most appealing stated aim is its desire to structure and professionalise exactly this kind of conversation; to provide a way for esports orgs to talk to one another in a way that avoids exactly this kind of unhappy fallout. I don t think that s a crazy idea, in and of itself. What, how, why Here s a broad outline: WESA is a committee featuring eight large esports organisations (Fnatic, NiP, Na Vi, Virtus.pro, G2, EnVyUs, FaZe and mousesports) and one tournament organiser (ESL). Representatives for these organisations are joined by a representative from a player council. WESA is distinct from other sports federations in that it gives players direct representation independent of their teams. Motions brought to the committee will require a 75% majority vote to pass, and any policies brought into being by WESA will only be applicable to WESA members and WESA-sanctioned leagues. WESA members will be able to play in non-WESA leagues, and non-members will be able to play in leagues that WESA oversees. WESA itself will not run events or leagues at all, but given the connection to ESL it s not surprising that the CS:GO Pro League is the first to be sanctioned by WESA. Areas of consideration suggested to me on Friday range from anti-doping to anti-gambling, broadcast rights, scheduling and legal dispute resolution. To that latter end, WESA will also operate an arbitration court designed specifically for esports. They boast that this will be able to operate via video chat, return a verdict within 48 hours, and allow disputes to be resolved independent of the complex web of national jurisdictions that esports has traditionally struggled to navigate. The association will fund itself with membership fees (the board would not specify how much this is) and by taking a revenue share of the leagues that it sanctions. This share is split evenly between all member organisations. Almost all of it has precedent within conventional sport (WESA s first league commissioner, Pietro Fringuelli, was previously a legal advisor to the German Bundesliga) and the failings of similar organisations, like FIFA, does not necessarily mean that this also will fail. Associations and unions are not <em>de facto</em> corrupt, and all governance is imperfect to a degree. If esports is to become more structured, that has to start somewhere. There is no perfect external authority to be consulted for an industry this new, with this many unique considerations. To that end, I understand why WESA has formed in the way that it has. Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson Cause for concern The controversy surrounding WESA, then, comes from a few different places: concern about who is involved in WESA and how much power they ll have; the motivations that drive its members; the failure of previous initiatives like this; a general distrust of centralised governance. I put these concerns to James Kennigit Lampkin, VP of Pro Gaming for ESL. You look back at an organisation like G7 Lampkin says. These teams came together and said we re going to work together, we re going to unionise against organisers and leagues . Then other people tried it. And it always failed. Why did it always fail? Because every single time a new game comes out, that relationship set resets. Those team owners are incentivised to be ultra-competitive in the space, get the best players they can, go after each other shady stuff happens. When you say to team owners, hey just go work together , consistently over the last decade it didn t work. Creating a stable structure that can produce guidelines that would survive the death of any given game was one of WESA s founding ideas. That was the thought behind the structure Lampkin says. Instead of having teams operate by themselves and organisers operate by themselves, maybe we could actually create something sustainable that doesn't get destroyed the second a new game comes out. This sentiment is echoed by Fnatic s Patrik cArn S ttermon, who was captain of the Fnatic CS:GO team for six years. You cannot really expect, in esports, that a title we play today will be around in a hundred years. But nevertheless we feel like a game can have longer longevity than it has today. In order to stimulate such, we need to get organised. We need to set standards. We need to ensure that the professional circuit that we are very much part of is well-defined, predictable, that sponsors can understand the scheduling and so on. This has not been the case in CSGO in particular. People think we re just coming in and making a power grab and trying to control the entire space. That is by no means the ambition we have here at all. Patrik S ttermon A lot of what WESA seeks to do (arbitration being the exception) already happens unofficially in some form or another. Esports orgs talk to one another in order to agree on schedules, players talk to each other about how they are treated, and how they d like to be treated, and so on. At its most benign, WESA seeks to make these processes more transparent and consistent. Teams, and players, have come together in very unofficial ways Lampkin says. We deal with a player union in Dota and a player union in CS:GO. But the significance of those unions is fairly small the Dota union, for example, exploded because of a Twitter fight between two players. An entire union destroyed because of a Twitter fight between two players. If we're talking about how to make this work, it has to be official. will govern and form regulation, but it will form regulation on itself, really Lampkin says. It's a collective partnership that brings stakeholders to the table. Both S ttermon and Lampkin acknowledge that skepticism is a likely response to any initiative like this. There will be questions asked S ttermon says. The community will be like, is this good for us? There have been projects that appear to be similar from the get go people have an inherent caution when it comes to uniting stakeholders, particularly when there are some dominant forces. People think we re just coming in and making a power grab and trying to control the entire space. That is by no means the ambition we have here at all. Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson The ESL-ephant in the room Given WESA s stated aim to professionalise communication in the industry, the question of who has been invited to participate in that process is a primary concern. There are a lot of high-profile teams already involved, but many that aren t. Most notably absent, however, are the other tournament organisers: MLG, DreamHack, FACEIT, and so on. As far as WESA s launch incarnation is concerned, ESL speaks for that entire aspect of the industry. This is clearly questionable, and the hardest thing about WESA to accept on trust. What we said was, if we're going to build this structure in WESA, then you're inherently required to balance ESL's power in that system ESL s Lampkin says. Because otherwise, as fans say, it looks like ESL's just going to try to dominate everything. That is specifically why we built it with players and teams with so much power. Certainly ESL as an organiser love our own events, but when you bring all these other people in who counterbalance that view, you get a system that allows for us to have a proper communication structure with other organisers and with non-member teams. The structure of WESA, Lampkin argues, prevents ESL from operating with the kind of impunity that concerned fans have suggested. Even so, there are understandable concerns about how ESL might influence the association s priorities, or take advantage of these new clearer lines of communication. To that end, Lampkin asks that people wait and see. What it comes down to is the actions of the association he says. If all the WESA teams pull out of ELEAGUE tomorrow, then you can quickly go and say 'hey, yeah, this was a terrible idea.' The point is that if, theoretically, ESL runs into the WESA board room and says 'we're shutting down everything!' The players say 'no, we're boycotting you' and the team owners walk out of the room and the entire organisation crumbles immediately. Because it requires consensus! That's the entire point of the system. Even so, the question but why isn t anyone else directly involved should be asked. Lampkin s answer surprised me. ESL was in negotiations with other organisers he says. Not all other organisers, but we were in negotiations. Hey, is there a way for us to align our interests.' And after months of this process, hmm-ing and ha-ing, we came to the realisation that, no, it fails. As leagues, we are too competitive with each other across the esports ecosystem. Lampkin didn t offer a specific explanation for why these discussions failed, so in that sense this remains another aspect of this difficult subject that the community is being asked to take on trust. We tried, but we re the only people who want to make this happen is the message here. And it s easy to be cynical about that message. This is an open playing field. There is nothing stopping any organiser from building systems, fighting doping, fighting corruption, fighting against match-fixing. James Lampkin When I spoke to Fnatic s Patrik S ttermon, however, he independently verified Lampkin s sentiment. We set out, as teams, to talk to tournament organisers a few years ago he says. Through that process, eventually we learned that what we can accomplish with ESL is superior to the other discussions we had. This doesn t mean that those guys are cancelled out or not in consideration going forward. In fact, we hope to set a great standard and maybe stimulate other regions to set up something similar. Maybe we can work together. There's always, I see it in esports press, I see it from fans, and I see it from our competitors, this implication that we're bulldozing or crushing Lampkin says. What we're saying is, no. What we're doing is we're working. This is an open playing field. There is nothing stopping any organiser from building systems, fighting doping, fighting corruption, fighting against match-fixing. Anybody can go and do that, it's just the case that ESL has been a bit ahead of the pack on a lot of this stuff. Look at the esports integrity initiative we had, AnyKey, WESA these are initiatives that we put forward with others to create a better structure within esports. Because literally we cannot do it by ourselves. This, at least, is something that can be independently assessed. ESL have repeatedly expressed an interest in professionalising esports no other tournament organiser has been as public about anti-doping, for example, or diversity. This does not mean that their involvement in WESA is altruistic, but it does lend credence to Lampkin s notion that ESL happens to be the organisation with the most drive when it comes to these issues. This might sound unfair, particularly if you re working for one of ESL s rivals: in which case the onus is on those organisations to prove that they re just as engaged. Put it this way: if WESA is successful in creating a system of governance that makes CS:GO players richer, safer and happier, and attaches that primarily to ESL events, then ESL will definitely benefit and that is worth being circumspect about. However: players will also be richer, safer and happier. That should make it harder for tournament organisers of all kinds, including ESL, to offer players anything less than the good deal that they ve become accustomed to. This is a best-case scenario, perhaps, but it illustrates why a pragmatic approach, even one that seems compromised, has the potential to exert a positive influence over the esports industry as a whole. This product is very close to my heart S ttermon says. Esports has been vastly changing, but some stuff hasn t changed in pace with the rest of the industry. Like player representation, benefits, broadcasting rights stuff you normally see in conventional sports that have been around for a long time. Photo credit: Riot Games Players and teams If long-term players want these things, and they are not being provided for in the industry as it currently operates, then they will go looking for it. It s worth considering that WESA has been established with a focus on CS:GO that seems to have been the main criteria governing which teams were initially invited and the CS:GO scene is probably the most open to this kind of structure. There s little publisher oversight, a lot of different stakeholders, and little stability. CS:GO is, I think, the one game where there's an opportunity for team owners to start to manage themselves without excuse the analogy without a parent says Lampkin. is not a reporting-upwards relationship, it's a consensus-building organisation. This is the sense that I get from S ttermon, too: CS:GO both needs better governance and is open to it. He cites League of Legends as an attractive model. I think there's a lot of learning to take from Riot S ttermon says. How they set up the LCS. The LCS has proven to be a very successful formula for teams, there's a schedule, there's a transfer window, the fans are really hype. That's similar to the sports world, and sports have had a much longer time to figure these things out. It s easy to see where the appeal of WESA may lie for teams like Fnatic. Reliable prize pools, regulations and schedules are good for business, and they are specifically good at attracting major sponsors that might be put off by esports wild west reputation. If WESA (or an initiative like it) succeeds, then the parties involved stand to benefit tremendously. But and this is a really important but stability and profitability translates directly into a better experience for players and viewers. If you want more events near you, better support for semi-pro teams, more regular games, then all of that stems from a healthier business. I m not saying that WESA can or will achieve this, but it s important to understand the contours of the area between trying to make esports more viable and trying to take over the industry. Through WESA, however, these organisations many of them a decade or more old have an opportunity to become the official governing heart of the CS:GO scene. They may well prove to be benevolent governors, but they ll still define the environment that players operate within. The growth of the Dota 2 scene makes for a useful contrast, here. The vast prize pools associated with the International, coupled with Valve s preference for working directly with players rather than teams, has created a highly unstable environment. The influence of the traditional esports orgs has been on the wane since 2014, when a number of teams split up and reassembled under new banners. This has been a mixed blessing: more freedom has, on occasion, meant more freedom to get screwed over . But players have largely been in charge of their own destinies. As prize pools in CS:GO increase, it s not surprising that the old orgs are looking for ways to increase their significance in the eyes of their players before the scene goes the way of Dota. If they re trying to do that by offering the players a better deal as part of a WESA member org than they d get on their own, however, then it s hard to say that this is necessarily a bad thing. Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson Long-term viability I suspect the discussion around WESA will change dramatically the moment they either (a) screw up or (b) solve a major problem for players. The former would prove the cynicism of the last few days warranted. The latter would suggest that ESL et al deserve more benefit of the doubt than they ve been getting. Beyond that, the organisation s first challenge is creating meaningful regulations that create more stability and better quality of life for players within the CS:GO scene. That is far easier said than done, and likely the work of months if not years. But if they can do that and that s another big but then the next step is to apply WESA s learnings to other esports. S ttermon is confident that this is possible. It s inevitable to capture the learnings and apply the learnings across the board, right? He says. Not only in future Counter-Strike leagues but within our organisation across other games. That doesn t mean it has to be a forceful approach it s about getting in the same room, understanding the opportunity and how we can collaborate together. The intention is to very much be open minded, include as many stakeholders as possible, but not forgoing the intention to professionalise the space we want to do this in a sustainable fashion. The only way WESA works is if it has the buy-in of players and teams. James Lampkin Lampkin argues that WESA doesn t need to take over the industry to be effective that it can be just as useful as a positive example independent of other organisations, and that they would be happy for this to be the case. I don t think Riot needs WESA, right? He says. But what we see is a lot of problems that we look to solve are either not the core competency of a lot of game publishers, so the goal for us is, we provide the solution even if we re not engaged with that publisher through WESA if we ve figured out how to solve anti-doping, or we ve figured out how to solve gambling issues, then just copy us! It s an open market. Despite the talk of the LCS, there s a little of Valve s logic to this stance. WESA will either succeed because its ideas work, Lampkin argues, or fail because they don t and either is good for the industry as a whole. The only way WESA works is if it has the buy-in of players and teams he says. It's the only way it works. I can go and ask nicely for a team to join but if they don't want to join they don't have to join. It's entirely based on the value proposition that we as a group here have created to try to stabilise things and create a better structure. There is a long, tough journey ahead for WESA. The association has been founded in a culture that was primed to reject it from the start, and it may yet prove that this is justified. Yet I worry that this same culture might prevent WESA, or an organisation like it, from being effective despite best intentions. If every attempt to establish standards is treated like a conspiracy, and every attempt to make esports more profitable treated like a scandal, then the conversation within the industry between teams and showrunners, teams and players, organisations and fans has almost nowhere to go. It s important to ask tough questions. As the esports industry matures, however, these are questions that need answering too: who is going to offer players a secure career path? Who is going to prevent another crash? Who is going to ensure that the rights of players don t get trampled as the business becomes more profitable? WESA may not prove to have all, or any, of the answers. In that case, the question becomes: who does? ",

        "contents": "A good sniper can turn the tide of a game. There are lots of different styles and each one helps the team in its own way. An aggressive peek that results in an entry kill can open up a site and make it a whole lot easier to win the round. With a more passive approach you can hold down a key area on the map and make sure your team is in control. In this article I ll try my best to introduce you to a few different styles and how they function within a team. In my previous guides to roles in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive I ve covered <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\">support</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\">entry fragger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-lurker-guide/\">lurker</a>. What is an AWPer supposed to do? Like I mentioned above, there are a lot of different styles when it comes to AWPing. Because of that it s difficult to say what a good AWPer is supposed to do. Ultimately, your goal is to win the game. In order to do so you need to understand a few things. First of all: your weapon costs $4750. That s $2050 more than an AK-47. Let s say you have full armor, an AWP, a smoke and two flashes and you re facing a guy with an AK-47 and the same equipment. If he kills you that s $6450 plus the bonus $300 he gets for the kill. Unless one of your teammates manages to salvage your AWP for the next round, it s a disaster for your team s economy. For the AWP to be a good investment you need to either kill the other team s AWPer or two riflers. Of course that s not always the case: you can get a one-for-one trade that opens up a bombsite and wins your team the round, but you get the point. In the long run, it s crucial that you don t throw away those precious rounds when you have the one shot-one kill beast in your hands. The AWPer should always try to stay alive for as long as possible. It s difficult to balance prioritizing survival and having an impact on the game. Therefore the AWPer needs to carefully plan their every move. Usually it s not wise to go and peek long on Dust2 without help from a teammate. Get your support player to flash you in and make sure they re there to trade the kill and pick up your weapon if you die. An AW:er should also have a backup plan. Choose the angles you peek carefully and make sure you have a way out in case you miss your shot. You should try to know your next move before you have to relocate. Like this: If you want success with the AWP, you need to try to find advantageous peeks. Especially if you suspect that the other team can t afford proper weapons. They might try to run you down with pistols in an attempt to do some serious damage to your economy. Another big part of being an AWPer is to know when to actually buy the AWP. A few players, like Josh JDM64 Marzano, buy the AWP almost every single time they can. Generally that s a weakness. Sometimes it s better to buy a rifle and play the long game. With experience, however, you ll learn what s right for you. Who should be an AWPer? You want a player who s highly accurate and who has fast reactions. Those traits will come in handy in duels against the other team s AWPer. Many games have been won or lost depending on the outcome of such a battle. If you ve watched aggressive AWPers like Jesper JW Wecksell or Kenny KennyS Schrub go for insane peeks from positions they shouldn t play from it s easy to think that you need to be a little crazy to be a successful sniper. On the surface it may look like they don t know what they re doing, which of course isn t the case. If you re the AWPer on your team you need to be able to weigh the risk and the potential reward. Your sniper player should be a person who can stay calm in all situations. Being an AWPer means that you re going to be under a lot of pressure at times. One hit and you get the kill and put your team in a great position. A missed shot on the other hand can lead to your team losing the round, and in the worst case force you to go for an eco the following round. Don t be afraid to communicate your ideas. If you think that you can kill the other team s AWPer in mid if someone flashes you in, ask for the flash. Be confident and define your own fate. Example of pro play Here s a clip from the ESL Pro League Season 3 final between Luminosity and G2. Marcelo coldzera David displays great awareness, precision, reactions and he has a plan. He knows what he s going to do. In other words, all the qualities you want a good AWPer to have. Now that Ladislav GuardiaN Kov cs and Olof Olofmeister Kajbjer both have been struggling with wrist injuries for a while I d say that coldzera is the best player in the world. He s had some insane performances as of late and shown a level of consistency that you d only expect from a true superstar. coldzera positions himself below the ladder next to the bomb train. From this position he s ready to assist his teammates wherever he s needed. As it turned out, Fernando fer Alvarenga got killed by Edouard SmithZz Dubourdeaux behind the green train. At this point coldzera knew that Gabriel FalleN Toledo had control over alley and that SmithZz was likely to peek as he had to pick up the bomb. Marcelo managed to pick up the kill, and immediately after the shot had been fired he climbed the ladder to make it harder for G2 to trade. As he climbed Adil ScreaM Benrlitom sprayed down one of coldzera s teammates. Because of that, coldzera knew exactly where ScreaM was and as a consequence went for an aggressive peek that paid off due to his pinpoint accuracy and fast reaction time. After that kill, G2 s Richard shox Papillon found himself in a very tricky 1-on-3 situation. He had 13 seconds to retrieve the bomb, plant it and at same time stay alive. Knowing this, coldzera just stayed put in his hiding place. shox killed both FalleN and Tacio TACO Filho. After that he had no time to go for the bomb. He had to either save his weapon or pick up the last kill. Because of coldzera s smart positioning, the only way for shox to win the round was by climbing the ladder, which is practically a suicide mission. He probably should have saved his rifle instead. So, what did coldzera do? He killed the bomb carrier, he put his team in a 3-on-1 situation by going for the aggressive peek towards the bomb train and he survived the round with his AWP. Plays like that can change the outcome of a game. Remember that an AWPer who s still alive poses a great threat and limits the options that their enemies have. How to practice First off all you want to be a competent rifler even if your main job is to snipe. I d recommend that you spend some time on deathmatch servers with both the AWP and assault rifles as often as you can. Get to know your weapons. A more specific way to practice your AWP is to study the maps. Go on an empty server and try to pre-aim all the common spots as you go around corners. Remember that your scoped in movement speed is significantly slower than when you re not scoped in. Scope just as you get around the corner, or else you ll be a whole lot easier to kill. Like this: If you learn how to do this properly you ll have a greater chance of winning those duels. As you might already know, you can t move and shoot accurately at the same time. What does this mean? It means you ll need to learn how to come to a halt as fast as possible. Let s say you re strafing left to get around a corner. At that point you re holding A (default keys are used in this example). If you then let go of A, you ll slide for a short distance. What you want to do instead is to let go of A, press D to counter that movement and then hold both A and D to make sure you stand absolutely still. Practice this move and in time it ll become second nature to you. Let s get back to those deathmatch sessions. There are different ways to approach your practice, but here s what s worked for me: try to practice only one aspect of your game at a time. In one session that might be shoot as quickly as you possibly can when you see an enemy . In another session it can be whatever happens I m not going to miss my shot . A third option can be that you focus on switching to your pistol as fast as possible to try to finish off enemies every time you miss a shot with the AWP. I usually focus on one thing for ten minutes, another for ten more minutes and then I ll just play for ten. That s some good all around practice in thirty minutes. Watch the pros play It s always a good idea to watch better players play the game and try to learn from what they re doing. Go to HLTV.org and download a few demos. Focus on their positioning and crosshair placement. Ask yourself why is this guy doing what he s doing? When it comes to AWP:ers there are lots of good players with various styles to watch. On the more explosive side of things you have players such as JW from fnatic and Oleksandr s1mple Kostylev. s1mple is one of those rare players with extreme talent. If he can learn how to control his emotions he s bound to become a real superstar one day. Then you have those AWP:ers who play a more passive style and who are great at holding down angles. Tyler skadoodle Latham from Cloud9 is one. Admittedly he s fallen off a bit from his old level of play. The fourth player I ll recommend is GuardiaN. Before his wrist injury he was considered a top two player in the world and for good reason. He s just a great player overall. I d say his greatest strength is his insane map knowledge. He can peek specific spots to perfection through smokes and he probably gets more wallbang kills than any other pro player in the scene. A bonus clip Every now and again something special happens in pro matches. The magic moments that we all love to watch. One of those moments were when Luminosity faced off against Liquid in the semifinals of the MLG Columbus major and coldzera did this: Valve even decided to make some permanent changes to Mirage in memory of that glorious moment. Never forget. ",

        "contents": "<em>Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson</em> When I say G, you say TWO! G! TWO! G! TWO! An English crowd cheering the French would be all but unheard of in most sports. Even here in CS:GO, where Europe holds a strong sense of solidarity, it still came as quite the surprise. Nevertheless, hearing the crowd erupting into roars of delight at every ScreaM headshot, there was little doubt about where their allegiance lay. And it was hard to blame them as London witnessed one of the most exhilarating demonstrations of force France has given in years. The ESL Pro League Finals pits the top eight teams from the North American and European scenes against one another. Limited to just four teams from each region, you d be hard-pressed to find any analyst predicting the likes of G2 to qualify over NaVi in Europe. It s no secret that French CS has been in a rut for some time now, holding fantastic talent but never quite able to realise their potential. Following the breakup of LDLC, all eyes had been on EnVyUs to carry French hopes forward, but thus far 2016 had only seen France fall further and further from the upper echelon of teams. But where EnVy may be waning, G2 finally seem ready to pick up the pace. Group stages Spot the bomb The group stages hosted at ESL&#x2019;s new studio in Leicester involved some of the most bizarre scenes in CS:GO history. In one round against Astralis, Optic Gaming spawned without a bomb: an event so unusual that the team didn&#x2019;t realise <a href=\"http://oddshot.tv/shot/esl-csgo-2016051112721811\">until they had taken the bombsite</a>. The event s opening looked set to provide a tournament of upsets as Canadian team Optic Gaming overcame a sluggish Astralis and, perhaps even more surprising, Luminosity fell victim to G2 on train, historically one of their best maps. Ninjas in Pyjamas just barely survived their encounter with Team Liquid, who failed to capitalise on no less than 12 match points in an all-too-soon flashback to the MLG Colombus semifinal. Come the weekend, only four teams remained: NiP, Fnatic, LG and G2. In what many had expected to be the highlight of the tournament, fan-favourites NiP faced off against an invigorated LG. Pushing NiP well beyond breaking point, Luminosity looked an entirely different side to the group stages, earning the first spot in the grand final. Hailing from Brazil but competing in NA, LG occupy an unusual position: they re popular in both EU and NA, but never the main fan focus. This hasn t stopped a passionate core of Brazilians from cheering their side on, however, no matter where they play. Following their victory, Luminosity s Captain, Gabriel FalleN Toledo discussed his fan-support across the globe: It's awesome because the Brazilian fans are starting to watch Counter-Strike again. Us playing well and reaching the top made them start looking for Counter-Strike again. We know that a lot of Brazilians live outside of Brazil there are a lot of Brazilians in London and they are here watching us play. It feels amazing to see all the Brazilian guys interested in Counter-Strike again. In the other half, G2 faced Fnatic. Struggling from the loss of Olofmeister, Fnatic still present a formidable opponent that can never be underestimated, as G2 were soon to find out. Suffering an embarrassing 11-0 opening, Fnatic looked in utter disarray. However with the change of half, it seemed the Swedes had awoken, and following an incredible 39 kills by Flusha, they dragged themselves out of the abyss to a map one victory. Fortunately for G2, this form was far from consistent, and over the course of the next two games, the French retaliated. A confident win on Cache led to a tense decider on Train. Missing a crucial Mag-7 shot on defence, Fnatic s JW was swiftly overwhelmed, allowing G2, the unexpected qualifiers, to push far beyond expectations and reach the grand finals. Feed the snake! <em>Photo credit: ESL/Scott Choucino</em> If there was one talking point for the weekend beyond the matches themselves, it was certainly the home crowd. Indigo at the O2 provided a surprisingly intimate venue for the finals, in a smaller-scale, dimly-lit arena. Up close and personal to the stage, the fans more than made up for numbers through sheer noise and bravado. As the largest prize pool event to be hosted in the UK so far, the developing scene brought fervor in droves. British fans celebrated in the only way they know how, creating unusual and entertaining chants of support while drinking rather too much alcohol much to the surprise and amusement of the casting team. While the attitude within the venue remained upbeat and never swung towards aggressive, the often unrelated noise did cause some confusion for the online viewership. During the second semi-final, volume of the game and casters on the upper balcony was low enough that fans became distracted. In scenes reminiscent of a cricket game, spectators began to create a staggering tower of stacked cups across the crowd, all the while chanting feed the snake! . Fortunately, this was taken in good spirits, with attention and support returning to the game at crucial moments. At the very least, the UK has shown it can provide one of the most fiery audiences in the esports world, unlikely to be forgotten any time soon. The grand final: Luminosity Gaming vs. G2 The final match of the tournament was nothing short of phenomenal. Unexpectedly, G2 elected not to ban Overpass, a map widely considered LG s forte having lost just one of their last ten matches there. The French firebrands clearly had a point to prove however, producing a powerful comeback to take a one-map lead. Having already defeated LG on Train during the group stages, G2 found themselves faced with a much tougher challenge in the grand finals. Despite an 11-4 lead in the first half, LG struggled to maintain control, calling a timeout at 12-all. Sensing their team s need, the Luminosity support in the crowd rose to the occasion, filling the arena with voices of support and lifting their side to the win. As each game progressed, it became clear that both sides were near-perfectly matched. Where G2 held fast on Cobblestone, LG fired back on Dust 2, winning G2 s map pick. In its final appearance in the current map pool, Inferno hosted the most intense finale of year as each team traded round after round before Luminosity took a two-round lead at 14-12. Just as it all looked to be over, G2 countered, winning three consecutive rounds to reach 14-15 and match point. LG, however, were far from finished, decisively driving the match into overtime. At last, it seemed, G2 were exhausted, with Luminosity claiming the crown at 19-16. The UK crowd had demanded entertainment, and they received the highest pedigree. Finishing with one of the best series of 2016 so far, the ESL pro league has shown that CS is entering one of the most volatile and exciting times of it s life. Luminosity Gaming have again established themselves as the best in the world, and G2 have finally returned French CS to life in explosive form. Electrifying the crowd, G2 s Adil ScreaM Benrlitom supplied <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO55v3f8_cc&feature\">countless highlight shots</a>, while Richard shox Papillon produced not <a href=\"http://oddshot.tv/shot/esl-csgo-2016051520314486\">one</a> but <a href=\"http://plays.tv/stream/5738f1b964c897155b\">two</a> 1v4 site retakes to keep his team in the game. French CS is back, and more exciting than ever. ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=529979703\"> Image via Steam Workshop, by Lord Rich. </a> What is the lurker supposed to do? Release your inner Ethan Hunt and bring out your sneakiest plays: it s time to talk about the lurker. Compared to the roles I ve covered so far (<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\">support</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-entry-fragger-guide/\">entry fragger</a>), lurker is the most distinctive in terms of what you re supposed to do and how to get it to work within a team. It would be easy to say that the lurker is the player who sneaks around the map on their own trying to backstab people. In a sense that s true, but there s so much more to it. The lurker is supposed to wander off by themselves and either secure kills or stall the opposing team s defenders rotation over to the site where the main attack is taking place. They should also scout ahead to let the in-game leader know whether it s a good idea to go for the intended execution or not. Let s say they re in apartments on Inferno (a moment of silence for our beloved and figured-out map) and they can hear that there s a CT on short as well as one in pit after you ve taken control over banana. In this instance, they know that the rotation is going to take a while and that it s probably wise to try to take the B-site. The lurker is also in a great position to kill the CT in pit once that guy realizes that the terrorists are swarming B. Alternatively, the lurker could go down to boiler room and try to kill the player on short in order to stay closer to B so that they can assist his team during the post-plant situation. There s a lot of decision-making involved when you lurk: decisions that can either make or break a round. Let s say the lurker decides to go for the kill in pit but the CT manages to get out safely. Then our lurker is in a bad situation and can t be of much help for their team. On the other hand, they might secure the kill and put some pressure on defenders in CT spawn, making it a lot more difficult to retake the site. Who should be a lurker? I d say that there are two primary qualities that a good lurker needs: creativity and good communication. A creative lurker can come up with plays that most other players wouldn t even consider. Coming up with a play involves good reads of what your opponents are likely to do as well as understanding what they may or may not expect. I d say your lurker should be a player who trusts their instincts. When I ask the lurker on my team how he came up with a certain play, he often replies with I don t know, it just felt right . Lurking is a highly intuitive endeavor. It takes time to get it right, so don t beat yourself up if you re new. The only way to develop this skill is through experience. The other part, communication, is probably the main reason why you want a lurker on your team in the first place. Your lurker needs to be able to assess the situation and provide good information. If they can t hear nor see a CT in a position where they expect a CT to be, they should alert the rest of his team as they might be about to walk straight into a meat grinder. Remember that knowing where the defenders <em>aren t</em> positioned will help you figure out where they <em>are</em>. Also, it doesn t hurt if your lurker is a person who watches a lot of demos in order to learn how top players generally react to certain plays. How does the B-player on Mirage generally react to a smoke strat over at the A-site? Is it possible to categorize players in different groups? The players who tend to rotate early, players who stay for too long and players who half rotate over to a more defensive position closer to the market area? If so, will that knowledge help you identify what kind of player that B-defender is in a live game? I think so. Study the game and tendencies and you ll have a better chance of making good decisions on the fly. It s also important that your lurker is individually skilled and can hold their own in a fight, as that s what they re supposed to do most of the time. Pro example This round was played during the grand final of Dreamhack Masters in Malm , Sweden a few weeks ago. Christopher GeT_RiGhT Alesund from Ninjas in Pyjamas starts off the round by going off on his own towards B. He jumps down to lower tunnels and is lucky enough to find Ioann Edward Sukhariev out of position on catwalk. As Edward goes down, the rest of NiP know that there s one less CT remaining on the A-side of the map. GeT_RiGhT proceeds by smoking off mid doors. At that point Na Vi have no idea how many players are around the mid area. As a result, they can t really start to rotate away from either site. Two flashbangs and a sneaky play through the smoke later and GeT_RiGhT picks up his second kill: Ladislav GuardiaN Kov cs. After that kill, he waits for a second or two but no one tries to trade off the kill from the B-side of mid, suggesting that the B-player might have pushed tunnels for information. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I think that the smoke in mid served two purposes. The first one and the most obvious one is that it allowed GeT_RiGhT to go for the sneaky play with the flashes. The second one was that it, in a way, forced Na Vi to go for a peek in tunnels for information, because at that point they couldn t know where NiP was going to attack. Knowing that there was a possibility that they would peek and find that no one was there made Christopher realize that there was a chance that the B-player was going to attempt to flank him. His flawless read of the play secured his third kill of the round as he managed to pick off Egor flamie Vasilyev. After that his job was pretty much done. He decided to stay in lower tunnels and make sure the last CT couldn t push mid doors. This time he missed the fact that Daniil Zeus Teslenko pushed short in an attempt to save his armor and CZ75-Auto. It s easy to see what an impact his lurk play had on the round. Not only did he kill three players, he also made sure that the defending players couldn t know where the main push was going to take place. How to practice lurking If you ve decided that you want to be the lurker on your team there s a lot of work to be done. The main area that I think you should focus on is your gamesense. Watch a lot of demos from your own games to find out how players on your level react to the things you do. How do the players on a certain site generally react to a flashbang thrown in a certain spot at a certain time. If you notice a pattern you should try to figure out what triggered the response. The best way to learn these things is to play a lot of games. Preferably against other pre-made teams, so that you know that they will communicate. It s even more important that you focus and try to figure out how a specific opponent plays during the actual game and how you can use that knowledge to your advantage. If your team goes for an A-push and you throw your flashbangs and a smoke towards B, how long did it take for the B-players to get to A? Is it possible for you to play in a certain way to trick them into doing what you want them to do? Because of the nature of your role, you should spend a lot of time on deathmatch servers. It s crucial that you get good at winning those aim duels. It s like that old Bruce Lee quote that s been cited almost too many times: I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times . If you spend more time working on the basics of the game than your opponent, you give yourself a greater chance to come out on top of any given situation. When you play games for practice purposes you should try to mix things up as much as possible so that, over time, you build a solid repertoire of plays that you can use in different situations. However, it s important to remember that when you play matches you can lure your opponents into a false sense of security by going for the same exact play every single round. Usually those plays involve a smoke and two flashes. It s important that you re able to stay alive once they know what you re up to. After a few rounds they might think that they ve figured you out and when you throw your utility grenades they know that you re alone. All of a sudden you show up with your entire team and the CTs haven t started to rotate in time. GeT_RiGhT might not have been the player who came up with that style of play, but he sure was the one to make it famous. He s able to pull it off on a professional level because of his raw individual skill. Like I said, put a lot of time into practicing the basics. Watch the pros play As with all roles in CS:GO it s important that you watch the pros play if you want to improve. First of all, you should try to answer the most basic of questions: what exactly is this player doing? By keeping that question in mind you ll look for the information that s actually useful rather than to just notice the big kills and wish that you could pull off stuff like that. Once you ve answered that question your next one should be: why are they doing what they re doing? Here s where it gets tricky. Look at what their teammates are doing and how the lurker s plays help them. Lurkers rarely just lurk for the sake of lurking. So, who should you watch? One obvious choice is GeT_RiGhT, the best lurker in the history of CS:GO and Counter-Strike in general. Every CS player can learn things from him. The next guy I recommend you to watch is Spencer Hiko Martin from Team Liquid. At the moment he s the strat caller for his team, so if you watch recent games you ll notice that he plays more of a support role than before. Take a look at a few demos from before the MLG Columbus Major and you ll find some useful stuff. His style is a lot more passive than GeT_RiGhT s, but he s really good at finding kills. Especially towards the end of rounds. You can find both recent and older demos over at <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\">HLTV.org</a>. Click Events and under Past events you ll find a link to their massive and awesome archive. There you can select specific events you want to watch and you ll have access to an almost infinite number of demos. Study hard. Play harder. Get to where you want to be. ",

Just last week, Valve s elimination of <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-vac-bans-tf2-hack-users-pro-players-caught/\"> a popular Team Fortress 2 cheat </a> nabbed nearly 170 pro TF2 players. And last year, it dealt over <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/stats/bans/\"> 1 million bans </a> to suspected accounts; with ownership counts likely exceeding <a href=\"http://steamspy.com/app/730\"> 20 million </a>, CS:GO likely represents a significant chunk of that figure. Earlier this year, CS:GO player AndroidL was inspired to take matters into his own hands. In late January, AndroidL created and dispersed a pair of free hack programs on a popular cheat forum. Unbeknownst to their downloaders, the programs were time bombs. They d function normally for a set period of time before permanently skewing the user s view angle to an abnormal tilt and enabling a constant bunnyhop script huge, obvious red flags that would immediately trigger a VAC ban. Although clever, the first few hack releases earned modest attention roughly 1,000 downloads apiece, according to AndroidL s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/43edee/how_i_got_3000_hackers_vac_banned/\"> Reddit post </a>. CS:GO has a cheating problem, AndroidL explained to me over multiple private messages. I don t think Valve is doing enough to prevent cheating; it doesn t speak publicly about VAC (for obvious reasons) or cheating in general. For such a competitive game with such an active and thriving community, Valve fails to at least acknowledge cheating is an issue in CS:GO which is appalling. Due to their failure to communicate, we aren't sure if Valve are actually attempting to combat cheaters or not. It's impossible to play a game of CS:GO today without suspecting someone on the enemy team of cheating. AndroidL used this chart taken from vac-ban.com to illustrate the impact of each hack's release. AndroidL s hack took a more direct approach. It dispensed with timers and prompted a ban the moment a user would load the hack and enter a match by continuously topping off health, ammo, and armor values. Yet despite the almost instant effect, it achieved greater success, accumulating over 3,500 downloads. Contributing to the hack s propagation was a simple testing method: I set the launch options of CS:GO to +sv_lan 1 -insecure which disables VAC (but consequently prevents me from joining any VAC enabled servers), AndroidL wrote. This means I can test the hacks without getting banned. I just played an offline game with bots where I was able to confirm the features such as editing my view angles along with health and ammo numbers. Once the hack s usability was confirmed, AndroidL uploaded it onto the cheat forum through a VPN to stay anonymous. The forum account was only days old with no reputation, which would typically undermine the legitimacy of the hack. But to promote the hack, AndroidL went for a straightforward solution: I had a few of my friends post messages such as great, the hack worked! and so on until the comments overflowed onto a second page. Most hackers don t check the second page of posts; they ll only read the first few comments and then download the hack. As publicly released programs tend to last only a few days before detection by VAC, dummy nods of approval was enough to push the scheme in front of as many eyes as possible while it lasted. AndroidL s favorite forum complaint. It's strange how people think they're entitled to free hacks, as if someone else is to blame for the consequences of their cheating. And it worked. The hack s impact was magnified by its sheer efficiency; a cheater couldn t react fast enough between launching CS:GO and meeting VAC s awaiting hammer seconds later. As bans started snowballing, users flooded the host forum with <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/zgpi7\"> warnings and grievances </a> of their sudden downfall. AndroidL feigned innocence by coming up with excuses as to why it wasn't my hack banning people to encourage others to download it. Members of the CS:GO community could already participate in culling the cheater population through Valve s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-community-to-regulate-itself-through-overwatch/\"> Overwatch </a> initiative for a few years now, but AndroidL s accomplishments demonstrate how one can more surgically hamper hackers with only modest extra effort. The victory could very well be temporary at best devoted cheaters can simply create a fresh Steam account and spend the $15/ 11 on another CS:GO copy but from AndroidL s perspective, the self-demise of those who sought an ostensibly easy access to a hack was worth it. The skewed view that a hacker would eventually see with AndroidL's hack. I think Overwatch is a very good idea, AndroidL wrote. It's another filter cheaters have to go through, but the only reason Overwatch exists is because VAC lacks the capabilities to detect all cheaters. Although I believe VAC is a good safeguard against cheaters, I don t believe it is a strong enough safeguard. There is little to no effort involved for a hack developer to bypass VAC it is a decent system to keep away the masses of people using public cheats, but other than that VAC is essentially futile. I do have a plan with similar tactics and I probably will do this again sometime, AndroidL continued. It would be great if I could cooperate with Valve to get a larger number of cheaters banned. Taking cheating into our own hands seems to be the only solution right now, and I encourage others that have the skills to do this to create similar fake hacks. Furthermore, I want to put off those thinking about cheating. This wasn t the first fake hack, and it definitely won t be the last. ",

        "contents": "University provides a fantastic opportunity for students with shared interests to connect through societies. Perhaps most enviable of all, it offers the time and flexibility to truly invest in a wealth of temptations: sports, media and, of course, video games. With its ever increasing popularity, It should come as no surprise then that esports would find it s place too. As both player and spectator audiences grow, communities across the UK have developed to accommodate this new demand, with lecture theatres providing the perfect venues for League of Legends, Dota 2 and CS:GO viewing parties. As a postgraduate researcher, I may not have the same freedom as I did during my undergrad years, but when I heard that an esports society had been created at Southampton University, I leapt at the chance to engage with players beyond my online team. I ve been playing CS for over ten years now, making it a not-insignificant part of my life. Despite my long relationship with the series, I d never really considered dabbling into the realm of competition beyond a few IRC-organised pick up games in the days of Source. Following a brief internal league however, I found myself on the shortlist to compete in the <a href=\"http://thenuel.com/\">National University Esports League (NUEL)</a> for Southampton s top team. Captained by Wildsam, and combining the might of Stubacca, Zack, Rennui and Ferno (myself), the 'Deadliners' were formed. Started back in 2010, NUEL was designed to support students with a passion for competitive gaming. Though initially focused on League of Legends, the game roster has recently been expanded to include Hearthstone and Counter-Strike. With the CS league relatively unknown, It wasn t clear what level of competition we d be facing. At the time of entering I held the rank of Legendary Eagle which, according to <a href=\"https://csgosquad.com/ranks\">current estimations</a>, put me in the top 10% of players. Now while that s certainly something I m proud of, it s still a significant jump from the top 0.6% that comprise the Global Elite. If any universities were fielding players of that calibre, we d certainly have our work cut out for us. Collected below are my experiences of each week of the league. I ll take you through our successes and setbacks, both in game and out. As a newly-formed outfit, Deadliners experience should provide a reference for what players new to the amateur competitive scene can expect. I can t guarantee your experience will match ours exactly, but hopefully you ll find the inspiration to take the plunge yourself. <em>The NUEL tournament consists of two stages. Teams play two best-of-one (BO1) games per week. The first two weeks are reserved for qualification. The top 16 teams enter a double elimination bracket in the subsequent weeks. The remaining teams are entered into the S-League and continue the BO1 format to compete for the highest possible position of 4th. Each week, the team dropped from the elimination bracket enters the top position in the S-League.</em> &#xA0;Week 1: UoM GO (Manchester) and BathA&#xA0; Anxiety and anticipation. Excitement tempered by trepidation. In the hour running up to our first match my mind was racing. Why hadn t we scheduled the time to practice beforehand? Who would our opponents be? What ranks should we expect? The degree to which a minor alteration to circumstance can change the entire weight of a match caught me by surprise. Though playing the same game as I would do any other evening, the added element of ceremony to a scheduled match brought a sense of unease I was wholly unused to. When it was revealed that we would be facing the previous winners of NUEL s winter season, University of Manchester, it s safe to say my aspirations for the match were stunted at best. Like most maps in CS:GO s roster, Cache is generally considered to be CT-sided, that is to say the CT side is expected to win more rounds in each half. We were therefore grateful to open in the stronger position. However, while the map may favour CTs, we quickly discovered that our team did not. Unable to maintain control of the centre, adaptation proved difficult and the lack of experience together quickly became evident, costing round after round. I had offered to play as our team s primary sniper, but with our economy in tatters I found myself barely capable of affording an AWP, let alone performing with it. Scraping together only a handful of rounds toward the end of the first half, prospects looked bleak. Fortunately, the half-time changeover provided a much-needed ease of tensions,finally allowing our team to relax into a pace that suited us. With a strong start, I was finally able to find my personal comfort zone, shifting location round-by-round to catch people off guard. Unexpectedly, we found the momentum shifting in our favour, finally allowing us to dictate the flow of play. When it finally came, victory was near euphoric. Had we really just managed that? If we could compete with the previous winners, how far could we expect to go? With our next opponents ready to play we had little time to celebrate, instead rolling straight into our second game and imminent demise. Where UoM had been precise, carefully timing peaks and flashes, Bath A were relentless. Piling onto sites in five-man pushes, the change in tempo blindsided us, overwhelming our shaken defence. Reeling from the high of a win, we suddenly found ourselves in the aftermath of a bloody loss. It looked like things wouldn t be so simple after all, but if we could just claim one match in the following week, our chances of qualifying for the elimination bracket were still good. Weeks 2/3: Loughborough and Ulster, OXG (Hull) and Swansea Green&#xA0; Sadly I was unable to compete during the second week, leaving my team to find a substitute. Even so, the knowledge that we needed just one victory to qualify for the knockout stage kept me pinned to my phone during the evening of the match. The news that finally filtered through was far from positive. Confusion and disagreements betrayed the result: we had lost both matches and were likely relegated to the S-League. Despite dropping to the lower league, I wasn t yet ready to give up, and together with my team resolved to give the remaining matches our all. The opportunity to play in a more formal setting and develop as part of a new team had given a whole new drive to my time spent in CS. I had already begun to see clear improvements to both aim and positioning, earning me a regular top spot in my matchmaking team. The first week in S-League served as a polar introduction to NUEL s broad range of skill. First lined up against OX Gaming from Hull, we found ourselves comfortably surpassing our opponents and eased into an almost-casual 16-5 victory. The relaxed attitude this fostered left us utterly unprepared for the 16-3 bruising we then received from Swansea Green. Competitors in the winter tournament, they showed such confidence and ease together that we were taken aback to see them outside the elimination bracket so early. It s safe to say that we were thoroughly outclassed, but as tough as a heavy loss can be, there s a level of benefit to competing against a higher class of player and no shortage of insight to be gleaned. Expecting to suffer some humiliating defeats, I had made a mental effort to take positive factors away from each match. At the very least, our execution had been swift. During the matches, we made a concerted effort to provide support toward each other beyond in-game actions. Our captain, Wildsam, was a constant voice of reassurance, never allowing the situation to shake him. Even while winning, it s easy for a player to set themselves off-kilter after losing a number of duels in a row. Usually found topping the frag count, Stubacca lost a series of contests early in the first match and was vocally shaken. However, support from the rest of the team meant it wasn t long before he was back on his feet. When playing as part of a team, it s important to make sure you re aware of your teammate s mental state and give them encouragement when necessary. After all, everyone has bad days. Week 4: SHUES (Sheffield Hallam) and 5 Noobs Who Don&#x2019;t Play CS (Portsmouth) Week four shall henceforth be known as the week of the food coma. There are some interesting lessons to be learned in competing around a fixed schedule, and one of those is to plan your dinner well. Much like physical sports, it s a bad idea to consume a vast quantity of food, no matter how delicious, before playing CS:GO. While not suffering the same stomach issues as a game of basketball would provide, my body had instead decided that reaction times and logical reasoning were unimportant when compared to digestion. As a result my time spent in the first match against Sheffield Hallam was spent staggering blearily around the halls of Cache. Fortunately, where I proved lacklustre my team was more than ready to pick up the slack, each member earning over 20 kills to secure a second S-League win. In a fitting twist of fate, the second game lined us up against Portsmouth s 5 Noobs Who Don t Play CS. Southampton and Portsmouth hold a significant University rivalry, sparring off against one another in each year s Varsity sporting competition. The prospect of a grudge match helped shake me out of my stupor, keen to uphold Southampton s winning record against our rival. Contrary to their name, we knew that Portsmouth was fielding at least one player of Global rank, an intimidating prospect for a team of Eagles. Playing on Overpass, far from our comfort zone, the match was a tightly-fought contest. If not for a herculean 30-kill effort by Zack, the match would have gone Portsmouth s way. Impressive individual performances can do a lot to boost morale in a tough match, providing a source of inspiration while easing some of the load for those struggling. However, repeated success can be a double-edged sword. If one member is seen to be consistently playing better than the others, it can lead weaker players to question their value to the team in general. It was therefore a pleasant surprise to find that our top scorer would shift every week, and often led the pack by only a small margin. That we had such similar skill levels was a surprising positive, allowing independent highs to shine without anyone feeling that they were falling behind. Unfortunately, this week also supplied its fair share of frustration, highlighting imperfections in the backend system for the league. Each week, match and server information was granted only within an hour of the scheduled time, causing some serious problems when the servers stop responding. After an exasperating 30 minutes of waiting and refreshing the NUEL site, we were all but ready to give up on playing when the information finally came through. Small failings like this are far from terminal, but marr the overall experience of an event, replacing anticipation with annoyance. Week 5: Hullmans Mayonnaise (Hull) and UoL:A (Liverpool) They found us. I thought the land of structured competition would be free of trolls, but still they come. HAHAHAHA they cry THE NEXT GeT_RiGhT? Within minutes of joining the server, chat was flooded and before long nothing intelligible was left. Then I remembered that CS:GO has a mute function. It seems a sad truth that any competitive game will be marred by a sizable, unpleasant portion of the community. For every friend I ve made through online matchmaking, I ve had to wade through at least five vitriol-spewing antagonists. Combining a volatile mix of anonymity, young audiences and adrenaline-fueled competition, it s all too easy for players to approach both allies and foes with a hostile attitude. The most depressing aspect is that derogatory remarks can even prove rewarding. The right comment at the wrong time can do a serious number on a player s mental resolve. Placed in a tense environment requiring a great degree of finesse, it doesn t take much to push most people over the edge, and the further you fall down the slippery slope of frustration, the more difficult it becomes to recover. That this kind of behaviour can be rewarding is infuriating to say the least, but to see it in a more serious competitive environment caught me off guard. You would hope that any team willing to commit to a weekly schedule would show some degree of maturity. Confrontational behaviour may sometimes provide immediate benefits, but it provides an unwelcome front for new players, and does little to progress the still developing realm of esports. Most competitive games have begun taking steps to punish abusive behaviour, offering temporary bans or time in purgatory but CS:GO still has a long strides to make in this regard. I should count myself lucky then that not a single member of my team took this approach. Even on the receiving end of our worst beatings, we stayed respectful. This resulted in a far more amiable environment. To be fair to our opposition, UoL:A were far from directly offensive, simply filling the chat with endless, key-bound memes and lines. A brief check of the NUEL site informed that their team had in fact qualified for the elimination stage but fell out in the first round. Their team had even beaten Swansea Green, at whose hands we received a resolute 16-3 drubbing. It was in all probability that they had little interest in competing further, and after ending the first half 10-5 they all but collapsed. Likely hoping to be dropped from the remaining games, UoL:A even submitted an opposing match report following the game, contradicting our victory. The poor behaviour did little to sour our mood however, as four straight victories in S-League had put us within touching distance of a top ten finish. Week 6: Surrey Lions and Warwick CS I d love to say our NUEL experience ended on a high, conquering all odds to close our tournament run with a hard-earned win. I wouldn t be far wrong, but it wasn t quite to be. Following a loss to the capable but disrespectful Surrey Lions, we found ourselves pitted against Warwick CS in one of the closest games of the entire tournament. Our two sides went blow for blow against each other, trading rounds throughout the first half to end at 8-7. With a strong pistol round, Warwick forged ahead, carving a five-round lead to reach 9-14. In what was probably my personal best performance of the tournament, both AWPing and rifling, we held the line. Clawing back round after round we finally brought the scoreline level. Then, just as it felt we had gained the upper hand, we were broken. A sloppy attempt to push onto Overpass B bombsite left our team in disarray. Warwick took the final round without competition. We had lost 14-16. A win would likely have placed us around 10th out of a 60 team roster, and I found myself thinking back for days on how we could have changed the result. Due to conflicting schedules, our team had been forced to find a sub for Stubacca in the last hour before the match. While performing admirably, it was clear that our sub was a little out of their depth. If only we had the full team. If only we had pulled back on that last B approach. While I was devastated at the time, the better team deserved the win and I couldn t have asked for a closer match to round out the league. Across the course of these twelve matches, each member of the team had gently gravitated into the roles that suited them best, and we found that we complemented each other well. Stubacca proved a competent solo player, more than capable of holding the B bombsite alone on maps that required it, while Rennui and Zack formed a stable rifling team to lock down control in a region. If I had to pick a weak point, it would regrettably have to be myself. Lacking in a dedicated AWPer, I had offered to play the role. Though I was more than capable of playing the aggressive T-side, I regularly struggled to hold the middle lane when defending. However, this trial by fire has since seen my sniping proficiency extensively honed, to the point where I can now comfortably say that the AWP is by far my best weapon. On reflection For a team of strangers, thrown together a matter of weeks before the league, I m extremely proud of our performance. Over the course of a few weeks, we developed together on all fronts of our game, from coordination to moral support. It s clear that the NUEL system is designed from the ground up for inclusion. While the elimination bracket is the main draw, the existence of the S-League gives new or inexperienced teams like our own the chance maintain a presence and vie with those of a similar capability. Competing in a league, even just at the bottom rung, gives a drive and energy to the game that can t quite ever be replicated in standard online play. Since the start of the league I ve been playing more CS:GO than ever before, even pushing myself into a higher skill group. Given the chance and time to practice, I would run it all again to aim for that elimination stage, and happily with the same team. The majority of Deadliners had entered the league unacquainted, but I wouldn t hesitate to invite any of them for a game in the future. This championship marks only the second NUEL foray into CS, and the back-end side is still showing some clear teething issues. With match information given only briefly before the start time, it s no surprise that server problems could lead to frustration. Re-use of a limited server pool once led to players for the following match joining the server for our still-ongoing game. There s also no clear way of checking the standings of either the elimination bracket of S-League on the NUEL site. Weekly fixtures list matchups and winners, but only within a group of five teams. To this day I still haven t been informed what place we finished. In truth, NUEL is a far cry from the bigger online leagues like FACEIT, but it doesn t really have to be. A large part of appealing to the student demographic is to encourage new communities and talent countrywide. With the backup of an S-league for drop-outs, NUEL gives newcomers a place to test the waters of competition before they dive into its murky depths. Would I recommend NUEL? If you re a university student and interested in CS, certainly. If nothing else, I can think of no better excuse to find a team and get practicing. <em>If any the above sounded like your cup of tea, the current NUEL season has just ended, leaving plenty of time to practice for the next. If you re not a student (or not based in the UK) there s no need to worry as plenty of alternatives are out there: the </em><a href=\"http://play.eslgaming.com/counterstrike/csgo/csgo/open/league/\"><em>Electronic Sports League (ESL)</em></a><em> run an open league at no cost of entry, while </em><a href=\"https://www.faceit.com/en/csgo\"><em>FACEIT</em></a><em> takes online matchmaking to the next level, scheduling games against other teams and running regular competitions for prizes. </em> ",

        "contents": "There is an ongoing debate whether players should be assigned roles in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Some argue that there are no roles and that each player has his or her own way of playing the game&mdash;that a team s success comes down to chemistry and individual skill. Others, myself included, believe that roles help you to systematise the way you approach the game. Anyone can throw a flashbang around a corner, that s true. But think about it: there are seven maps in the pool. Let s say your team practices five of those, and that each map has at least a hundred useful flashbangs, smokes and molotovs. Learning all of those grenades takes a lot of work. Sure, every player should practice grenades, but doesn t it make sense to have that one guy on your team who specialises in just that? Someone who can flash you in from any angle on the map? What does a support do? Here s what a defines a support player the way I see it: a support player should spend a lot of time learning all sorts of grenades and when to throw them. If your in-game leader says that your opponents tend to play from a specific spot, the support player should know a grenade that will make life harder for them in that specific circumstance. Just like with all roles in CS:GO, communication is super important. The support should be good at adapting their play according to the information that their teammates provide. In my mind the support player should focus more on the tactical aspect of the game than most players. A lot of the time the support will carry the bomb, and it s their job to know whether it s best to help with clearing the site or go for the plant. Every situation is unique, but if you play and study the game enough, you will have a pretty good idea of what the best play is. Because of the nature of the role, the support player will often be the last man alive, so it s important that he or she has good game sense and is creative enough to win 1-on-X situations. Outside of matches, it s important that the support player spends time talking to the in-game leader so that they know what grenades they should spend the most time practicing. It s also common for the in-game leader to play a support role themselves, as they know exactly where and when they want key grenades to be thrown. An example of pro support play This example is taken from the Brazilian team Luminosity s game against the Poles from Virtus.Pro at MLG Columbus. Luminosity went on to win the game and, eventually, the Major. A much deserved victory after insane comebacks achieved with a smart, disciplined style. The player making the support plays in this example is Lincoln fnx Lau. Note: he s not considered a pure support player, but this round in particular illustrates a lot of different things that I d like to see from a support. There s a lot happening in this clip. First we see fnx stand ready with a flashbang towards upper park from playground. Gabriel FalleN Toledo peeks with the AWP. Should he spot someone pushing long, fnx would throw their flash and Marcelo coldzera David, FalleN and even fnx himself are ready to clean up. This time no one s pushing, so they decide to take control over long. Coldzera throws a molotov over to the tree area. Then they wait for a second before fnx flashes. Following the flash, coldzera immediately jumps out to bait a shot from any snipers on long and then FalleN steps out with their AWP in order to either catch a player backing off from the tree out of position or&mdash;as in this case&mdash;to kill the sniper further back. In the next sequence fnx briefly plays the entry role by jumping across the restroom entrance so that coldzera can pick up a kill if a CT stands there&mdash;which isn t the case this time. After that fnx tries to gather information as safely as possible towards the A-site by jumping, before he smokes off the chokepoint. As he moves closer to the site, he s lucky enough to find an extra flashbang. Before the smoke fades, he throws a molotov over to the corner to the left of the smoked-off chokepoint in order to clear another angle for their team. As the smoke starts to fade, he pops a flash through it. At that point, he s in a great position to trade kills for their teammates. As soon as coldzera goes down outside restroom, fnx pushes forward, aware that he might need to make a play. After the site is cleared and the bomb is planted, he moves inside the bank for a great post-plant position and manages to kill a rotating Virtus.pro player. This round shows a lot of good plays that we can learn from. As you could see, fnx did a lot of different things and even if you call yourself a support player it s important that you can adapt to the situation and do what s needed to help your team win the game. Who can play support? The lazy answer is anyone . Anyone can throw grenades, carry bombs and pick up a kill every now and then. But let s return to my previous definition of what a support player is: a player is someone who is good at throwing grenades, is interested in the tactical aspect of the game, and can come out on top in clutch situations. If you want a good support player on your team you should look for a highly intelligent individual who s good at reading the game and can adapt to different situations as the play develops. It s also important that he or she is patient and dedicated enough to learn all the necessary grenades. A support is a player who always puts their team first. These players are rare gems, in my book. Not everyone has what it takes to spend hours upon hours on empty servers trying to perfect grenade throws. There s also a creative aspect to the support role. As you spend all those hours trying out grenades you ll find that you come up with new strategies and plays that can be useful to your team. I d say that support players are like bass players in bands. They re a key part of the system, but often they get a lot less praise than they deserve. If you think you can do all these things and have all these qualities you might be destined for a support role. How to practice CS:GO offers an almost infinite number of ways you can practice and I won t be able to cover them all. First up, you will never be a good CS:GO player unless you re good at shooting and nothing can replace hours spent on deathmatch servers. For the support stuff, however, I d recommend that you head to an empty server to practice grenades. YouTube is a great resource when it comes to tutorials, and I covered many map-specific grenade throws in my CS:GO map guide series: you can find links to allow of them at the bottom of this article. You can also try to come up with your own grenades. Find a spot you want to flash or smoke and try doing it from different angles. Get a friend to join and hold from different positions so that he can let you know if he got flashed or not. One thing you need to ensure is that you re on a 128 tick server. If you play on 64 tickrate servers (matchmaking servers are 64 tick) the grenades trajectories will be slightly different. Normally that s not a problem, but for the more advanced throws it can make a huge difference. Next I d recommend that you try to find so-called retake servers. On those servers the terrorists spawn on a bombsite with the bomb and the CTs spawn in different retake positions. You ll also be able to choose what weapon you ll spawn with. This is a great non-competitive environment to try out your grenades. It will also help you improve your decision making in clutch situations. Just like with everything else in life, you get better at what you spend a lot of time doing. If you ve been in a 1-on-1 situation on dust2 s B-site a thousand times and your opponent s been in the same situation a couple of hundred times you re at a massive advantage. I went on a retake server to show you guys how it works. This one is a pistols only server on Mirage: I came up through connector and decided to peek towards CT-spawn. When I saw that my teammate in spawn was battling it out with a terrorist on the minimap I decided to peek another angle. As soon as the CT in spawn died I knew there was a possibility that the T would peek from that angle so I checked it again. The bomb was ticking away so I had no choice but to go for a play. I got lucky and timed the peek from the terrorist inside palace and I spotted another one on T-ramp. When my last teammate died I knew the positions of both terrorists so I decided to take the fight with the one in CT-spawn in order to bait the other guy to push up, which he did, and I managed to pick up another kill. Unfortunately I fell short on the last duel because of bad crosshair placement&mdash;and that I took too long before I went for a play earlier in the round. That breakdown of my round brings me to my next piece of advice: record your matches and watch the demos afterwards. Try to look for the things you did well and determine the reason why those things worked. But more importantly, look at what didn t work and try to come up with things you could ve done differently. You can also let a more experienced player take a look at your demos and give you advice. Watch the pros Another thing you can (and should) do is to watch demos of pro teams. Watching streams and VODs is great fun, but you won t be able to rewatch rounds from different perspectives like you can if you watch demos in-game. A good resource for demos is <a href=\"http://hltv.org/\">HLTV.org</a>. Find a match you want to watch and download the GOTV demo. Once you ve done that you launch the game and press ALT + F2 to bring up the demo UI&mdash;or you can type demoui in the console. Then press load , find the demo you want to watch and press play. There s not a single pro player who plays support roles in every single round and on all maps, but there are some players that I d recommend you to watch. Freddy KRIMZ Johansson from fnatic is one. He s one of the smartest players in all of CS:GO. Andreas Xyp9x H jsleth from Astralis is another. He s great at throwing grenades and can find what looks like impossible clutch kills. Watch how they play, try to get a sense of their decision-making, and do your best to apply it to your own game. <strong>Find all of our Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map guides here:</strong> * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\">Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\">Inferno Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\">Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\">Cache Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\">Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\">Overpass Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\">Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\">Cobblestone Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\">Train Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\">Train Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\">Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\">Mirage Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\">Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/\">Dust2 Terrorist guide</a>; <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Call outs <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;id=157442340\">Here's an overview of the map</a>, including call-outs that are good to know. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\">Last week</a> we looked at how to defend on Dust2. This time we'll talk about why Dust2 is an excellent map for split pushes, how to take control over the map and how to deal with different financial situations. Dust2 is a map that can be played in so many different ways. Mid doors, tunnels, long and catwalk are all choke points that separate you from the counter-terrorists. That means you have time to set up your pushes and execute pre-planned strategies if you want. It also means that you can split up and try to pick off your opponents one by one if you have good aimers on your team. First of all, full out rushes without a plan aren't going to win you games. They might work from time to time, but for the most part it's better to go for map control to make it harder for the CTs to get in position for a retake attempt. The B-split One of the most effective ways to cut off defending players from the rest of their team is to smoke CT-spawn and then push B from both mid and tunnels with flashbangs. I like to try to \"force\" certain rotations so that my team and I can be ready for whatever comes our way. What I've found particularly effective is to take control over the pit area on long before the B-split. Make the CTs back off a bit so that they won't have enough time to push through T-spawn or top of mid. Now you can be fairly certain that any rotating players will go through either CT-spawn or short. Leave one player on long until the rest of your team is ready to execute the split. At that point your long player can back off to top of mid and either kill players rotating or call out how many have crossed mid doors or entered lower tunnels. For the split itself I prefer to have one player in tunnels and three players going mid. As soon as the spawn smoke has bloomed and the three musketeers have control over mid, the player in tunnels can start to throw flashbangs and make life miserable (and short) for the player on B-site. Taking control over long and catwalk You don't want to peek long without a flashbang. Ever. A teammate can throw a flashbang over long doors so that you can go for the duel right after it pops. If you get the best spawn towards long I'd recommend that you go for it. Just make sure you have a friend ready to trade kills if you miss your shot. Should you decide to go A after you've taken control over long it's crucial that you smoke off CT spawn to make it safer for you and your team to enter the site. The most obvious problem when you want to take control over catwalk is the player&nbsp;in mid. You need to do something to deny them their much needed target practice. I like to put up a smoke screen on top of xbox. Even if you don't go catwalk after the smoke, the other team will still have to keep an eye open. The mid player will tell their&nbsp;team that there could be terrorists there. If you decide to attack catwalk you should always ask a teammate to throw a flashbang for you. From lower tunnels is one way to do it. When you attack from short A you want to give the defending players as many angles as possible to worry about. The best way in my mind is to have one player drop down to CT spawn. In order to do that you have to use another smoke. Note that the guys on long don't need to waste a smoke to cross over to site if you use this smoke instead: Keep it simple Anti-eco A round where your opponents haven't bought weapons and you try to secure the round with as few casualties as possible. As you gradually get better at CS:GO it's common to overcomplicate things. When it comes to anti-eco rounds on Dust2 I've tried all sorts of things over the years with various level of success. Then I heard analyst Janko 'yNK' Paunovic talk about the subject and he suggested (I'm paraphrasing) that you should all just go long and deny the CTs those close-range duels where their CZ75s can turn into a real problem. I totally agree. There's no reason to make it more difficult than it has to be. Eco rounds Eco rounds 'Eco round' is short for 'economic round'. That's a round where you buy little to no items. The purpose is to save money so that you can afford the big toys later. Same thing here: don't overcomplicate things. When you go for an eco round, you want to plant the bomb and get that mad cash. I&nbsp;like to invest in a smoke grenade and a couple of flashes and go for the B-split I mentioned earlier, except I wouldn't have a player over on long. You need all your firepower to take the site. Getting pushed by tec-9s from three angles at the same time is a scary thing. Don't hesitate, just go for it. I hope you found this guide helpful. Keep playing the game, try new ideas and have as much fun as possible and you'll improve. <strong>Find all of our Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map guides here:</strong> * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\">Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\">Inferno Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\">Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\">Cache Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\">Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\">Overpass Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\">Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\">Cobblestone Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\">Train Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\">Train Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\">Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-terrorist-guide/\">Mirage Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/\">Dust2 Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Call outs <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;id=157442340\">Here's an overview of the map</a>, including helpful call-outs. Dust2 has been immensely popular ever since it was introduced in the Counter-Strike 1.1 patch. To this day it's by far the most played map. Even though Dust2 slightly favors the terrorist side, it must be considered one of the most balanced competitive maps in the current map pool. Because of the map's popularity people have found lots of different ways to defend the two iconic bombsites. What I, along with many others, have found over the years is that it's usually easier to go for retakes rather than to stay on the sites and fight to the death. This is especially true for the A-site as there's basically nowhere to hide if you get pushed from both long and short at the same time. Over at B you have more options and a sole player can, with assistance from the mid player, work wonders. The set up Pop flash A flash that you throw that 'pops' just as it enters your opponents field of view. I like to take control over long early in the round by sending two players over there. The second player can throw a pop flash just around the corner to allow the first player to get over to pit. If the terrorists haven't shown any sort of aggression towards long after a few seconds the second player can rotate back to either A-site or mid, depending on what information you have. The third player will hold short from above the stairs, ready to drop down to CT-spawn if he spots terrorists. If not and the player in mid has a clear view of catwalk, the short player can push a little bit and go for a quick peek towards lower tunnels for information. The fourth player will hold mid. Their job is to give the A-players information about anything happening at catwalk, as well as delaying that infamous B-split through mid and tunnels. If the terrorists have an AWP, this can be a bit tricky as you can't peek catwalk without putting your life and the round at risk. Just remember to call out that you don't have control over catwalk anymore. The fifth player is obviously the B-player. I like to place them either on platform or on the site so that he can fall back after the initial duel. If the stars align and the mid player is ready with a flash, the B-player can pick up two kills, making the retake a lot easier. Some neat tricks Dust2 differs from other maps in that you will have to put yourself at risk just to reach one of the sites. I'm of course talking about the doors in mid. A skilled (or lucky) AWPer can take you out just seconds into the round. One option is to put up a smoke screen, but a lot of the time you want to save your smokes for later. Another way to do it is to use a grenade. The black smoke from the explosion works just as good as a smoke grenade, but you'll have to time it right. Sometimes you want to get a player up on short faster. Those times you can simply boost them from the boxes just outside CT-spawn. The downside is that you'll only have one player over at long for a couple of seconds. Fortunately you can use this smoke to assist them. Retakes Unless the terrorists decide to go for a rush, the retake starts long before the bomb goes down. The more information you gather early on, the better decisions you'll be able to make later. Let's say your player on B has spotted some terrorists in tunnels and your friend in mid saw someone peeking from the top of mid. You're on long and it's been all quiet so far. Now you have three options. You can push towards T-spawn which, given the information you have, is a risky play but with great potential reward. You might be able to backstab the terrorist in mid or you can run through T-spawn and be in a great position for a B-retake. Your second option is to fall back towards the A-site, so that you're closer to B when the attack happens. The risk with that play is that your opponents might decide to go long after all and you won't know until they're around pit. Lastly, you can decide to stay put and wait for more information. However in this case it'll take you ages to get to B when the terrorists execute their strategy in that direction. That's the general idea. Assess the information you have and make an educated guess as to what your opponents will do next. This flash can be really effective when you try to retake bombsite B: If you time it properly with a teammate flashing through tunnels it can work wonders. Remember to communicate: who's going to clear what angles? This next retake flash is another one that allows you to push right after it pops: Aim at the sloped area next to the stairs, run and throw. Simple, yet effective. That flash will make it a whole lot easier for your friends in CT-spawn to get closer.

Dust2 has been immensely popular ever since it was introduced in the Counter-Strike 1.1 patch. To this day it's by far the most played map. Even though Dust2 slightly favors the terrorist side, it must be considered one of the most balanced competitive maps in the current map pool. Because of the map's popularity people have found lots of different ways to defend the two iconic bombsites. What I, along with many others, have found over the years is that it's usually easier to go for retakes rather than to stay on the sites and fight to the death. This is especially true for the A-site as there's basically nowhere to hide if you get pushed from both long and short at the same time. Over at B you have more options and a sole player can, with assistance from the mid player, work wonders. The set up Pop flash A flash that you throw that 'pops' just as it enters your opponents field of view. I like to take control over long early in the round by sending two players over there. The second player can throw a pop flash just around the corner to allow the first player to get over to pit. If the terrorists haven't shown any sort of aggression towards long after a few seconds the second player can rotate back to either A-site or mid, depending on what information you have. The third player will hold short from above the stairs, ready to drop down to CT-spawn if he spots terrorists. If not and the player in mid has a clear view of catwalk, the short player can push a little bit and go for a quick peek towards lower tunnels for information. The fourth player will hold mid. Their job is to give the A-players information about anything happening at catwalk, as well as delaying that infamous B-split through mid and tunnels. If the terrorists have an AWP, this can be a bit tricky as you can't peek catwalk without putting your life and the round at risk. Just remember to call out that you don't have control over catwalk anymore. The fifth player is obviously the B-player. I like to place them either on platform or on the site so that he can fall back after the initial duel. If the stars align and the mid player is ready with a flash, the B-player can pick up two kills, making the retake a lot easier. Some neat tricks Dust2 differs from other maps in that you will have to put yourself at risk just to reach one of the sites. I'm of course talking about the doors in mid. A skilled (or lucky) AWPer can take you out just seconds into the round. One option is to put up a smoke screen, but a lot of the time you want to save your smokes for later. Another way to do it is to use a grenade. The black smoke from the explosion works just as good as a smoke grenade, but you'll have to time it right. Sometimes you want to get a player up on short faster. Those times you can simply boost them from the boxes just outside CT-spawn. The downside is that you'll only have one player over at long for a couple of seconds. Fortunately you can use this smoke to assist them. Retakes Unless the terrorists decide to go for a rush, the retake starts long before the bomb goes down. The more information you gather early on, the better decisions you'll be able to make later. Let's say your player on B has spotted some terrorists in tunnels and your friend in mid saw someone peeking from the top of mid. You're on long and it's been all quiet so far. Now you have three options. You can push towards T-spawn which, given the information you have, is a risky play but with great potential reward. You might be able to backstab the terrorist in mid or you can run through T-spawn and be in a great position for a B-retake. Your second option is to fall back towards the A-site, so that you're closer to B when the attack happens. The risk with that play is that your opponents might decide to go long after all and you won't know until they're around pit. Lastly, you can decide to stay put and wait for more information. However in this case it'll take you ages to get to B when the terrorists execute their strategy in that direction. That's the general idea. Assess the information you have and make an educated guess as to what your opponents will do next. This flash can be really effective when you try to retake bombsite B: If you time it properly with a teammate flashing through tunnels it can work wonders. Remember to communicate: who's going to clear what angles? This next retake flash is another one that allows you to push right after it pops: Aim at the sloped area next to the stairs, run and throw. Simple, yet effective. That flash will make it a whole lot easier for your friends in CT-spawn to get closer.

This week we'll have a look at how to play the terrorist side on Mirage. The general idea is to take control over one area at a time and limit the number of angles you have to check as you attack the bombsite. I'd suggest that you put in a few extra hours learning grenades on Mirage. To say that grenade management is more important on T-side Mirage than on any other side in the entire game is a bold statement, but one that I'm willing to make. For the same reason I'd say you should think twice about buying if you can't afford smoke grenades. As long as you have a solid plan you'll be able to dictate the course of the round and force the defenders to react to your plays. A smokes It's rarely a good idea to attack the A-site without smokes. My suggestion is to smoke off stairs, jungle/connector and CT-spawn. What these smokes do is that they isolate the bombsite. If the defending players are on the site you can push and go for trade kills and make it a three-versus-three situation where you have planted the bomb and the remaining CTs will have to fight you as well as the clock. Here are the smokes compiled into a single gif: I usually have one player below T-ramp protecting his teammates while they throw the smokes and one player in palace, whose job it is to use utility grenades to help his team with the push. If he's not smoked off he can bounce a flashbang on the wall so that it bounces past balcony and flashes any potential threat hiding in shadows. If he is smoked off, on the other hand, he has another option. He can either use the flash mentioned above or he can throw a molotov down to shadows and force any player there to move out in the open to a disadvantageous position. Once you have the site your number one priority is to protect your bomb carrier. Pre fire the box next to ticket booth and use flashes. Do whatever it takes. Just don't let the CTs stop him from planting as that'll give rotating players more time to get in position for the retake. You can also have a guy lurking in mid or underpass, ready to kill any counter-terrorists trying to rotate through connector. <em>On the next page: controlling mid and managing your eco rounds.</em> Take control over mid The best way to give your team options is to take control over mid. From there you can choose to attack either site and you'll even have time to change your mind should anything go south. The most obvious spot you want to clear is the window room. A simple yet effective smoke from T-spawn is all it takes. That smoke won't cover the infamous connector-to-top-of-mid-peek. If you want to get over to the boxes in mid you can use another smoke from spawn, followed by a molotov into window. This will allow you to go for that peek towards catwalk. It's also a good way to make room for your Impossible Missions Force, led by your very own Ethan Hunt, to go through underpass and boost up into the window room. Most of the time you want to go for a split when you attack B, because of the tight choke point in apartments. When you do just that I'd recommend that you use the smoke in window room as well as a smoke from B-apps to connector. Note that the counter-terrorists can stand inside connector and see you if they're on the right hand side. Just prefire that angle as you move towards catwalk and you should be fine. The guys over at A-site won't be able to see you over the smoke. The rest of your team will join the party from apartments. A flash that I like to use when pushing apartments to B is the one through the window. Time this one with a flash from catwalk and you should be able to kill the guy around pillar and then take the rest of the site. If you manage to take control over the site early on you can leave one player inside apartments. That's one of the strongest post-plant positions. Not only can you make sure no one can sneak up on you, but you'll also be able to run the clock down in a one versus one situation. Eco round Eco rounds 'Eco round' is short for 'economic round'. That's a round where you buy little to no items. The purpose is to save money so that you can afford the big toys later. Your objective here is to plant the bomb. That extra $800 per player can turn the tide of a game. Buy two smoke grenades and move towards T-ramp. You'll also have one player inside palace, who'll try to distract the guy on top of stairs while you plant the bomb. Throw a smoke over to jungle/connector like I demonstrated at the beginning of this guide. The other smoke will be used like this: Plant the bomb inside that smoke. You can make sure the bomb carrier buys one of the smokes as the personal plant bonus of $300 will cover the expense. If you're really low on money then you can buy a flash and throw it through the window in B-apartments and then just go ham with a full team rush. Just make sure you move silently before the push or you'll be screwed faster than you can say bomb plant. Like always, try to have a plan and communicate a lot and you should be able to put up decent numbers. <strong> Find all of our Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map guides here:</strong> * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\">Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\">Inferno Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\">Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\">Cache Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\">Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\">Overpass Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\">Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\">Cobblestone Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\">Train Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\">Train Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-mirage-ct-guide/\">Mirage Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "This weekend is dominated by IEM Katowice, which started a few days ago and continues through Sunday. It's an exciting event with a half-dozen different games being played competitively. Not to be outdone, however, the odyssey that is Dota 2's Shanghai Major also reaches its conclusion this weekend. And we've also got a newcomer on the scene, with card game Hex: Shards of Fate hosting a high-stakes invitational tournament. Dota 2: The Shanghai Major finals The Shanghai Major has been&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-comedy-and-tragedy-of-the-dota-2-shanghai-major/\" target=\"_blank\">an interesting tournament</a>,&nbsp;to say the least. But amidst all the drama and memes, one thing has generally been agreed upon: There's some pretty great Dota being played in Shanghai right now. And the&nbsp;tournament finally comes to a conclusion this weekend, with the Lower Bracket wrapping up on Saturday, followed by the LB finals and the Grand Finals on Sunday.&nbsp;The <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/dotamajor\" target=\"_blank\">stream</a> starts at&nbsp;10:00 BJT (02:00 GMT/18:00 PST the previous day) and runs for close to 12 hours. Then you can watch the&nbsp;finals on Sunday, which will begin at&nbsp;10:30 BJT (02:30 GMT/18:30 PST the previous day). The schedule has been flexible, to say the least, but you can find <a href=\"http://www.dota2.com.cn/theshanghaimajor/english/schedule?date=03-05#pos\" target=\"_blank\">hypothetical start times</a> here. Hex: Shards of Fate: Invitational finals Hex: Shards of Fate is fairly new to the esports scene. A digital trading card game more similar to Magic: The Gathering than Hearthstone, it will be interesting to see how it presents itself in a tournament setting. Any way it goes, Hex is starting out big with a live invitational event at the Esports Arena in Anaheim, flaunting a massive $100,000 prizepool. The tournament starts tomorrow at 10:30 PST (18:30 GMT) and you can watch all the games on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/hextcg\" target=\"_blank\">official stream here</a>. League of Legends:&nbsp;IEM Katowice League of Legends has one of the most imposing presences at this weekend's IEM. Saturday sees the entirety of Group B's games being played, with Group A shaking out earlier today. International tournaments like this are a unique opportunity in the LoL competitive world, which is otherwise quarantined into its respective regions. Group B begins tomorrow at&nbsp;12:20 CET (11:20 GMT/03:20 PST), and the semi and grand finals kick off the next day at the same time. You can find the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://intelextrememasters.com/season10/worldchampionship/schedule/lol/\" target=\"_blank\">full schedule right here</a>, and&nbsp;watch all the games on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_lol\" target=\"_blank\">official stream</a>. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive:&nbsp;IEM Katowice grand finals The CS:GO tournament has nearly wrapped up before the weekend even begins, but there's one more very important match to play: The grand&nbsp;finals. Tomorrow at 18:00 CET (17:00&nbsp;GMT/09:00 PST) will be the last match of the event for Counter-Strike, which you can&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo\" target=\"_blank\">watch here</a>. StarCraft 2:&nbsp;IEM Katowice semis and finals Similar to CS:GO, StarCraft 2 will also has mostly wrapped up by the start of the weekend. This Legacy of the Void tournament has seen the overwhelming success of Zerg players, with six of the top eight players using the race. While Polt on Terran has already progressed to the semifinals, the opposing side of the bracket is made entirely of Zerg, and he'll either be facing&nbsp;HuK on Protoss of Nerchio on Zerg in the next round.&nbsp;The semi and grand finals will begin tomorrow at&nbsp;12:20 CET (11:20 GMT/03:20 PST) with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://intelextrememasters.com/season10/worldchampionship/schedule/sc2/\" target=\"_blank\">full schedule here</a>, and you can watch&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_sc2\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>. Heroes of the Storm: IEM Katowice - Spring Regional Heroes of the Storm is using IEM Katowice as the stage for its Spring Regional Tournament and, as a result, is probably the esport with the most games going on at once over the weekend. There will be two full days of matches being played, and nearly half the matches on Saturday will be happening off stage to make sure they have time to fit everything in. You can read up on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://intelextrememasters.com/season10/worldchampionship/schedule/heroes/\" target=\"_blank\">full schedule here</a>, as it may be the best way to figure out what's happening in the off-stage games. Everything starts at&nbsp;12:00 CET (11:00 GMT/03:00 PST)&nbsp;on both Saturday and Sunday, and you can watch the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_heroes\" target=\"_blank\">main stream here</a>. Hearthstone: IEM Katowice - ESL Legendary Series Unlike the other games as IEM Katowice, Hearthstone decided to squish its entire tournament into a single day. That's most likely because this is a continuation of the ESL Legendary Series, which has been running for a while. What that means is they'll be starting at the top eight part of the bracket, and playing through until a champion is crowned. Games begin tomorrow at&nbsp;12:00 CET (11:00 GMT/03:00 PST)&nbsp;and you can catch all the matches&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_hearthstone\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

Due to how easy it is to either throw a molotov or to smoke off the window room, it's rarely a good idea to go for the early peek unless you have a plan for what to do if you find yourself surrounded by a gray cloud. Let's start with the set up. Generally I like to play one player on the B-site, whose job it is to spot enemies and call for backup. I would advise against peeking from the van unless you have an AWP and are ready to fall back after the initial shot. It's still a risk due to how easy it is for terrorists to rush down a solo AWPer on B. I would suggest that you try to go for jump peeks from time to time. Even if they're ready for it you're difficult to hit and you'll get loads of information! The next player is the player on cat. Their role is crucial for your team, but it can be quite challenging. They will listen for footsteps towards underpass or in B apartments. Other than that they'll make sure no one can enter connector without your team knowing. The challenging part is to know when to let go of connector and assist your buddy over at B. Just don't forget to let your team know that connector is open when you do. Next in line is the other mid player. Like I mentioned earlier, I don't like to peek from window room unless it's a quick peek and you spawned close. Aside from the smokes and molotovs, you risk getting killed early on. If that happens the terrorists can push whichever site they want, knowing that the defenders from the other site will be late to the party. Instead I like to have the mid guy in window room peeking catwalk. If he gets smoked off he can wait for a few seconds and then put down a molotov on cat and then decide if it's best to rotate towards connector, market or to simply stay put. Should the terrorists on the other hand choose to go aggressive towards connector, he can use this pop flash to peek and hopefully secure a kill. The last two players are obviously the ones on A. It's rare to see an A-push without smokes towards CT spawn, jungle and stairs these days. That makes it a walk in the park for terrorists to isolate defenders on A-site, which is why I'd recommend peeks from far back. CT stairs, danger box and the area around stairs are excellent spots. Once you see the smokes come in you should call for backup and then assess the situation. If they don't seem to push you can tell your teammates to go back to their previous positions. If they however do push you can try to use the smokes to your advantage. Call for a flashbang onto site from either connector or jungle and then jump up on ticket. Another great option is to spray through the smoke as soon as you hear the bomb plant. If you manage to drop the bomb you have gained valuable seconds for your team to get in position for the retake. <em>On the next page: how to handle eco rounds, plus a few neat tricks.</em> Eco rounds 'Eco round' is short for 'economic round'. That's a round where you buy little to no items. The purpose is to save money so that you can afford the big toys later. Eco rounds Sometimes you'll find yourselves a little short on money, in which case it's time for an eco round. I'd suggest that you push up mid from connector and use a flashbang to try to catch any peeking terrorists off guard to secure a weapon or two. Just don't do this every eco round as it will get pretty obvious after a while. If you have a little more money you can go for a grenade stack on A and wait for smokes to come flying over T ramp and then welcome the push with your explosives. A few neat tricks If you feel confident and want an early advantage you can show off your acrobatic skills and push palace. Smoke T ramp and jump up on the balcony. Once you're in position your friend can flash you in from stairs. If you get a kill you've made their A-attack a lot weaker. If you on the other hand don't find a terrorist at all you can start to slowly advance. Think Metal Gear Solid. Just remember that you only have one player defending A, so it's important that he re-smokes T ramp to buy you a few extra seconds. Once you make it all the way to T spawn you will have a good idea as to where the final push will happen. The retake from market to B can be quite tricky as you have two really tight choke points to choose from. To make that endeavor a little easier you can use this smoke from CT spawn: Just remember that this is a double-edged sword, as it will give the terrorists more options in addition to taking options away. This next trick will take some practice, but can be really useful. Let's say you're going for a retake on B and get spotted early on inside market. Then it's really unexpected for you to show up on catwalk just seconds later. <strong>Find all of our Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map guides here:</strong> * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\">Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\">Inferno Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\">Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\">Cache Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\">Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\">Overpass Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\">Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\">Cobblestone Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-ct-guide/\">Train Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-train-terrorist-guide/\">Train Terrorist guide</a>; <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "It's all kicking off this weekend, with a Dota Major underway and a CS:GO Major undergoing its final qualifiers. There s also Heroes of the Storm,&nbsp;Hearthstone and Smite&nbsp;to watch and another week of international League of Legends to take in. If the year s been a little quiet so far, that s certainly coming to an abrupt end. If your Dota 2 casters seem a little quiet, however, that s an entirely separate technical problem. Dota 2: The Shanghai Major group stage The Major has been off to a strange start, with solid games&mdash;and one <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/mvp-phoenix-smash-expectations-at-dota-2s-shanghai-major/\">amazing underdog story</a>&mdash;fighting against production problems and the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dota-2-shanghai-major-host-let-go-after-the-first-day/\">abrupt loss of a panel host</a>. Even so, this is<em> the</em> event in the Dota circuit right now, and the weekend will see the remaining games in the group stage. Tune in on Saturday to see if Frankfurt champs OG can repeat their success in Shanghai. Sunday will see one of the most hotly-contested groups as coL, EG, VP and Liquid duke it out. The <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/dotamajor\">stream</a> begins at 09:00 BJT (01:00 GMT/17:00 PST the previous day) and runs for ages. The schedule has been flexible, to say the least, but you can find <a href=\"http://www.dota2.com.cn/theshanghaimajor/english/schedule?date=02-27#pos\">hypothetical start times</a> here. Heroes of the Storm: NA Spring Regional The region's best teams fight for a share of $100,000 and a spot at the Spring Championship in Korea. This is one of the highest-profile events of the HotS calendar so far this year, so makes for a good opportunity to take the scene's temperature&mdash;much as <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/what-the-winter-prelims-said-about-hearthstones-future-as-an-esport/\">Hearthstone's own Americas championship</a> was last week. Games start at 10:00 PST/18:00 GMT each day and you can find the stream <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_heroes\">here</a>. Hearthstone: PGL Spring Tavern Tales 2016 $25,000 on the line for some of Europe's best Hearthstone players as 32 of them descend on Bucharest. It'll start with a Swiss group stage followed by single-elimination playoffs for the top 16. The games started today, and will continue throughout the weekend. Play begins at 09:30 GMT/01:30 PST and continues through the evening. Find the stream <a href=\"http://info.computergames.ro/l/uZieegNmPXK602C7Y6MUXQ/cVwyN53I747YeMcxnSPSQg/rZKs763auJ7Tr7nvFWkwAmSw\">here</a>. League of Legends: NA LCS and LPL Another weekend, another chance to keep tabs on the dominant teams in the US and China ahead of the upcoming Mid-Season Invitational. You can read James Chen's assessment of how each scene is doing <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/forecasting-lols-mid-season-invitational/\">here</a>, and find details on schedules&mdash;as well as the livestream&mdash;on the <a href=\"http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/\">official LoLesports site</a>. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive: MLG Columbus 2016 Main Qualifier While the top eight for MLG Columbus 2016 is drawn from the world's best-regarded teams, a further eight have a chance to shore up their qualification hopes this weekend. This is the first CS:GO Major to offer the new prize pool of $1,000,000&mdash;a massive increase for a scene that was previously capping out at around $250,000. Play starts at around 12:00 EST (17:00 GMT/09:00 PST) each day, and you can find the stream <a href=\"http://tv.majorleaguegaming.com/channel/csgo\">here</a>. Smite: Spring Split Relegations Smite is currently going through a multi-phase relegation process to determine which teams advanced to play in the Pro League proper later in the year. This weekend will see phase two play out in Europe and North America, as the winners of the open bracket&mdash;players like you or I, but better&mdash;face existing Challenger Cup teams for a coveted spot in the big leagues. Games start at 13:00 EST (18:00 GMT/10:00 PST) each day on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/smitegame\">official Smite Twitch stream</a>. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

We're back! This time we'll go over how to attack on Train. At first this might seem a little tricky but as long as you use smokes before you attack you should be able to pick up a few rounds. There are a few reasons why smokes are so important on Train. The first being the long distances and how easy it is for an AWPer to kill you as you initiate the push. The second is that it helps you get the bomb planted. Unless the CTs climb trains or go through a smoke, they can't really know how many terrorists are there. One thing to keep in mind is how separate the bomb sites are, and that you need to control ladder room if you want to be able to rotate effectively. Most of the time these rotations will be quite obvious and the counter-terrorists will be able to get to their next stop much earlier than you re comfortable with. Chances are that you will find more success if you execute a pre-planned strategy towards one site after you've gathered information and maybe even picked up a kill. Smokes on A Let's dive into the fine art of smoking bombsite A. There are some really useful smokes on the outer trainyard. Because I'm a good guy and I care about your browser's well-being I'll include two smokes per gif (with a hard g). The first smoke is going to cover the area between connector and bomb train to make it easier for a terrorist to attack from ladder room without getting killed. The second one will smoke between the brown train and the bomb train to make the last part of your journey with the bomb a little more convenient. You will also want to smoke on either side of the blue train. Here's how to do just that: If you use all of these smokes you are almost guaranteed to get the bomb down, but there are problems. The defenders will be able to attempt a retake with five players still alive and you won't have any smokes left for the choke points after the plant. Of all these smokes, the one to the left of the blue train is the least important in the sense that it doesn't help you transport the bomb to site. The smoke does however make it less attractive for the CTs to attempt a backstab. If you don't want to use that smoke you can peek that lane with an AWP instead. Or you can leave a gap somewhere else, as long as you have a plan and are ready to challenge your opponents. After you have planted the bomb it's very important to communicate. Make sure you have ladder room covered. I don't know how many times my team has been sprayed down from there just because we failed to communicate. Especially if the guy who's supposed to take care of ladder died during the push. Make sure you take post plant positions that will make it easy for you to peek towards the bomb. <em>On the next page: attacking bombsite B.</em> Attacking bombsite B Just like on A, smokes are a crucial part of a successful B-take. The first smoke is very straightforward. Simply smoke off lower to deny any snipers far back their much needed target practice. It's also a good idea to pop a flash before you push in case a counter-terrorist is waiting for you on top of low train. The next smoke will make it easier for you to reach the plant spot. Line up the smoke and time the throw with whoever smokes lower before you attack. The third smoke is for upper. Just like the one on lower the main purpose is to avoid getting killed by a player far back. Once you have the smoke screen up you can assist by making sure no one tries to sneak up on your teammate while he plants the bomb. Remember that you don't need to take the site with five terrorists. It doesn't make sense to go ham with the entire team and then have to try to get back through lower for a post-plant position. I recommend that one player stays behind to make sure that you are aware of any counter-terrorists coming in from behind. Take your time Because of the nature of Train you will have lots of time to decide what site to attack. Before the final push, you are quite separate from the defending team. This gives you the opportunity to split up and try to secure kills. Pay attention to how your enemies play. Will they rotate a guy from B if you get a kill on ivy? Are they passive and slow to rotate? Use information of this kind to your advantage. 'Eco round' A round where a team buys little to no equipment in order to save money for future rounds. Try to keep track of what they bought in the previous round and how many losses, wins and surviving players they've had to get a sense of whether or not they will be able to buy proper weapons. This may seem a bit confusing, especially if you're new, but it's important. If they are on an eco round they are more prone to go for the risky play, which means you will need to be careful. For instance, if you're up against an eco and you don't gather information before you attack you might run into a five man stack on one site. Because of your smokes you won't be aware of the fact until it's too late. Bonus trick! This molotov is really strong in one versus one situations to keep the counter-terrorist off the bomb for a few extra seconds.

This molotov is really strong in one versus one situations to keep the counter-terrorist off the bomb for a few extra seconds.

        "contents": "Call-outs <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;id=157442340\">This excellent resource for map call-outs</a> has already been updated with the new Nuke. Valve just released&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/operation-wildfire-comes-to-csgo/\">Operation Wildfire</a>, and with it comes a brand new version of the map Nuke. Once immensely popular, Nuke got removed from the competitive map pool due to balance issues. A remake of the map has been requested by the community ever since and now we ve got one. Welcome to the Cedar Creek Nuclear Power Plant! My first impression of the map is that it looks gorgeous. It's very bright and colorful with amazing textures. The visibility is vastly improved compared to previous iterations. But what did they change? Pretty much everything. The biggest alteration is probably the ladder leading up to silo from T-spawn and the rafters connecting silo with catwalk. I've played a couple of games on matchmaking and so far I've enjoyed it. The first thing I noticed was how easy it was for the terrorists to take control over yard. There are so many angles for the counter-terrorists to cover even just a few seconds into the round. It's still too early to dive into any sort of strategic analysis, but we found that the good ol Nuke mindset just isn't going to cut it. We had more success when we took a more passive approach and stayed close to the bombsites with one guy trying to spot enemies on yard from far back. Another big change is the vents. Now there's only one opening both upstairs and downstairs. They have, however, added a new door with a decontamination room to give the defenders more angles to worry about. I think the door will be a key point on the map that both the Ts and the CTs will want to control. They have also added another door downstairs, just below the ramp. That door allows for some really cool crossfires and gives the counter-terrorists more incentives to play close to the site. It's hard to say how the metagame is going to develop, but overall l I think the changes to the B-site are interesting. Changes upstairs The upper bombsite has also seen some major changes. The biggest being the addition of skyboxes to prevent defenders from reaching dogwalk. This means that pushes through squeaky will be a lot more effective as there are fewer angles to check. Valve also moved the upper canisters further back to give terrorists more cover as they attack through hut, as well as adding a ladder leading up to the rafters. These changes are bound to have a huge impact on the balance of the site. It will both be easier to take the site and to defend it once you have planted the bomb. On the CT side, they've added a box in front of the window as well as made changes to the small roof outside catwalk. These changes will allow for really dynamic plays with lots of movement and positioning options. Final thoughts The map is most definitely more T-sided than it's been in the past, maybe even a bit too T-sided. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for Nuke. As I see it, it's not impossible that it'll be added to the competitive map pool. The question then is, what map will it replace? Or will they increase the number of maps? Personally I could see Inferno getting replaced at some point because of the often very slow rounds due to effective smokes. Balanced as Inferno might be, I'd still like to see faster gameplay from a spectators point of view. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

Nonsense. The latest update is a big 'un, demanding two micro-sites of its own and&nbsp;incorporating tweaks, Operation Wildfire and an upgrade for&nbsp;de_nuke. <a href=\"http://counter-strike.net/operationwildfire\" target=\"_blank\">The&nbsp;Operation Wildfire event</a>, which runs through to June 17, gives everyone access to seven new community maps, including Tulip, Cruise, Coast and Empire, in addition to the spruced-up Nuke. However, if you're willing to pay&nbsp;the&nbsp;$6 entry fee, the Operation Wildfire Access Pass comes will a host of new features. Two new campaigns are available: the Wildfire Campaign, made up of&nbsp;Casual, Deathmatch and Arms Race missions,&nbsp;and the co-op Gemini Campaign which packs three&nbsp;all-new Co-op Strike missions and 23 Guardian missions. Both campaigns reward mission XP with each success, and by completing Challenge Missions you can upgrade your flashy&nbsp;Wildfire Coin, shown off alongside your avatar. Blitz Missions are like time-limited achievements open to players worldwide. For a couple of hours, you'll earn bonus XP for completing goals like scoring wins in competitive Empire matches. The usual array of pretty stuff is thrown in too: the Wildfire Case contains 16 community weapon skins and a Bowie knife. de_nuke, which has existed in a series of incarnations since 1999, has received an extensive face-lift, proving that Source can still get the job done when it has to. To convey the magnitude of the changes,&nbsp;Valve has a series of before-and-after sliders on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://counter-strike.net/reintroducing_nuke/\" target=\"_blank\">the dedicated Nuke site</a>, along with a breakdown to supplement our exhaustive&nbsp;analysis appearing later today. Finally, polish has been applied where needed.&nbsp;The leader s glow in Arms Race no longer shows through walls, which is a little more sporting, detail sprites like grass has been improved so Valve can pack more on the screen, and Cache and Mirage have received special attention.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2016/02/13629/\">The full patch notes are here</a> for you to contemplate, but as a good early indication, not many of the Steam comments are openly furious.

Now we're back on track (choo-choo!) with a counter-terrorist guide for Train. Train is another map that, like Cobblestone, has seen a lot of iterations throughout the years due to balance issues. The map itself consists of two train yards, an alley and a hallway. Your objective is to prevent the terrorists from blowing up one of two nuclear payloads. Defending inside Let's start with the inner bombsite. What usually happens is that the terrorists smoke off lower before they push down the ramp. This means it's a risk to stand far back and peek lower. After the smoke you won't know if they actually pushed site or not unless you have a teammate closer to the bomb train. You can however take an auto-sniper and shoot blindly into the smoke and do some serious damage. In addition, the long distances make the auto-sniper a really powerful weapon for retakes. My favorite spot is the bomb train. If done properly you can dance around the train all day while you wait for backup. Especially if your team has a sniper nearby that keeps the enemies from pushing you. Peek over the train like this: If you're lucky (or a sick aimer) you might pick up the first headshot. Then you can use a molotov to delay the push, fall back and call for backup. Most of the time your opponents will use flashes and smokes before they attack from upper, in which case you will know and have time to back off. Another option is to have another player holding upper. Anti-eco A round where your opponents haven't bought weapons and you try to secure the round with as few casualties as possible. Sometimes you want to let out your inner ninja and go for the unexpected heroic play. One really cool spot is behind the spools between lower and upper. Normally I'd advise against staying close to your enemies on anti-eco rounds because of the risk of providing them with a weapon and a chance to get back into the game. But on round two, if you managed to win the pistol round, you can pick up a submachine gun and go for it. The SMG kill reward of $600 can mean a great deal later on. I've lost track of how many triple kills I've made from this position on the second round. Other times you want to show off your great communication skills. Tell your teammate to stay close on upper and get ready to peek, then you throw a flashbang just as you get next to the fuse box on the wall. The flash will pop right in the face of any terrorists standing at the bottom of the stairs. As soon as your friend hears the pop, he can go for a quick peek and hopefully score a kill. <em>On the next page: defending outside.</em> Defending outside For the most part you can just hold angles, communicate and take the aim duels as the site has three really tight choke points: namely t-connector, ivy and ladder room. Every now and then you will however want to mix it up and consult that great playbook of yours. If you have a good spawn towards ivy you can go aggressive. All you need is a flashbang and the heart of a lion. Bounce the flash off the floor and keep running. Now the terrorists have two options. Either they die because they turned around, or they die because they didn't. It's not that simple, but you get the point. You can gain a lot from pushing ivy every now and then. For instance, if you know their team has an AWP and your team doesn't, going aggressive can result in you acquiring one. At the very least you will gather much-needed information. If you know your opponents have a tendency to take their time you can try to sneak up on them. Otherwise it's probably wisest to back off and help your teammates around the bomb train. As Train is a pretty straight forward map to defend I will give you some advice for those games when you're on the receiving end. Here s the scenario: you re down by a couple of rounds and your economy is low. Just before all hope is gone, you decide to do something about the situation. You buy a MAG-7 shotgun and flash your way into the ladder room. This is a risky play because if you have to move out in the open and try to retake a bombsite you are most likely screwed. On the other hand it can win you the round if you manage to surprise a terrorist coming down the ladder and pick up his AK-47. Be careful! It may seem easy to win the CT half on Train but you should keep two things in mind: It's just as easy for your opponents and it's really difficult to win eco rounds because of the long distances. What this means is that you should try to hold onto your precious weapons. You want as few eco rounds as possible. This mindset will win you games on Train. Don't chase down that last terrorist unless you think you can do some serious damage to their economy. <strong>Find our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map guides here:</strong> * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\">Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\">Inferno Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\">Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\">Cache Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\">Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\">Overpass Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\">Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-terrorist-guide/\">Cobblestone Terrorist guide</a>; <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Call-Outs <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;id=157442340\">Here's an overview of the map</a>, including call-outs that are helpful to learn. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-defend-on-csgos-cobblestone-map/\">Last week</a> I showed you ways to improve your CT-side. Now we'll have a look at the map from the other perspective. Most of the time it's best to attack the B-site, but that doesn't mean you don't have to keep the defenders guessing. Go for the occasional A-round and use fakes every now and again. The reasons why you should attack B most of the time are numerous: It's fairly easy to prefire common angles with the AK, you can rotate to A pretty fast if needed and the B-site is one of the most difficult sites to retake once the terrorists have taken control over it. How to use drop room to your advantage I hope you brought your sportswear, because it's time to get sweaty. Once you execute a play through drop you generally have to be really fast unless you want to be trapped and vulnerable to all sorts of grenades. As soon as you hit the floor in drop there's no turning back. This is no place for faint-hearted people! 'Popflash' A flashbang that is thrown in such a way that it doesn't give players a chance to turn around before it \"pops\". I like to use this popflash before I drop down. Yes, it's true that there are more efficient flashes, but that would require one player on your team to stand back and flash instead of joining the push from long B. 'Eco Round' A round where you buy little to no equipment in order to save money for upcoming rounds. As soon as the flash pops, you and a teammate can drop down and wreak havoc. Decide who takes the right side and who takes the left before you go. The drop popflash combined with a smoke on the left side of drop room might be one of the easiest ways to secure an eco round plant unless your opponents are ready for it. Simply smoke, flash and go A through connector. If you wait for a few seconds before you make your move, there's a chance the defender on A has already started to sneak up on you from behind, leaving the bombsite open. Note that this strategy is just as effective on normal rounds. Smokes on B You can use a few easy smokes to limit the number of angles you have to check once you try to take the site. The first one is used to smoke off the area behind the cube to make sure no optimistic counter-terrorist can kill you from drop room. Line it up, jump, throw. Then wait for a second or two before you throw a flashbang using the same exact throw. The other smoke I'm going to show you is used to cover one side of hen house. With that smokescreen down you only have to check the right side. But remember that a CT can still hide there. It's crucial that you assign a guy to check hen house once you've taken the site. <em>On the next page: the question of A.</em> How do you take A? You will face a few challenges when you choose to go A. First of all you need to take control over long A and pit, unlike B where you pretty much get long B for free. One of the best ways to secure these areas is by having a teammate pop a flash just past the double doors in pit. Then another player can enter and check all corners. Without a flash you more or less commit suicide by going pit. After that you have control over stairs. That's when a guy on long A should throw a flash through the window and blind any defenders nearby. Hopefully he'll back off and expose himself to the guy waiting in stairs. You may need to practice that flash a few times before you get it right. Now you've come to the part where you need to slow down the rotation from B. For that purpose you can smoke off connector door and balcony from long A, like this: While you perform all of these sick moves it's a good idea to let one player fake B with a smoke and a couple of flashbangs, just to further delay the rotation. Another option is to let him use the popflash in drop that I showed you guys earlier and try to get a kill or two. Remember that the defenders will receive the necessary intel and start to rotate long before you actually make the final push on to A-site. After you've planted the bomb on A, there aren't many post plant positions where you can stay without being vulnerable from at least one common retake angle. I can't stress this enough: It is easier to win rounds when you attack B. The pistol round Winning the pistol round is crucial when you play T on Cobblestone. Due to the long sight lines, you're more or less screwed on the second and third round if you don't manage to score big on the pistol round. For the same reason, however, it's difficult to win the pistol round. As you already know, the usp-s and P2000 are far better at long range than your glocks. Therefore I recommend that you buy at least one tec-9 and use it to secure drop room. Just don't forget to flash first. If you secure the first kill you can make life difficult for any remaining defenders by attacking from both drop and long B. <strong>Find our other Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map guides here:</strong> * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-ct-guide/\">Inferno Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-inferno-terrorist-guide/\">Inferno Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-ct-guide/\">Cache Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cache-terrorist-guide/\">Cache Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-ct-guide/\">Overpass Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-overpass-terrorist-guide/\">Overpass Terrorist guide</a>; * <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cobblestone-ct-guide/\">Cobblestone Counter-Terrorist guide</a>; <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

Intentionally or not, the map operates as&nbsp;political criticism, as satire, and simply as&nbsp;a casual siege in the style of cs_militia and thousands of others that have come before it. While the map&nbsp;isn't a 1:1 recreation of the real-life refuge, it's more detailed than you'd expect for something&nbsp;created in reaction to national news. I've recorded some footage in the video above; a snowy compound of closed buildings surround an interior, main building where the pair of 'bird watchers' are held captive beside couches and brochure stands. Nipper explains the map's&nbsp;backstory&nbsp;on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=598715073\">Steam Workshop page</a>: <em>\"A group of heavily armed patriots known only as 'Vanilla Isis' have decided to launch a rebellion against their tyrannical government! Using their brilliant tactical mind they chose their first target: a mostly unoccupied bird sanctuary and wildlife refuge. After about 2 days of holding this territory from the feds they have unfortunately run out of vital supplies like slim jims, energy drinks and beer. In an act of desperation for more supplies they have taken a couple of orange jumpsuit wearing bird watchers hostage. Now with human lives at stake the feds have been forced to respond.\"</em> Supplies are running low. In the stash:&nbsp;apples, 'Sophia's' microwave dinners, fresh potatoes, vanilla drink, assorted juice. What a time to be alive, where we can where we can play out the political&nbsp;events of our time&nbsp;in team deathmatch as they're still happening. What would a CS:GO map based on the Boston Massacre look like? cs_wildrefuge isn't the first map&nbsp;modeled after a controversial event, of course&mdash;<a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/156014\">fy_abbottabad</a>,&nbsp;a more authentic recreation of&nbsp;Osama bin Laden's Pakistan&nbsp;compound, was a&nbsp;well-circulated Counter-Strike:&nbsp;Source map&nbsp;in 2011.

        "contents": "Back in July, Valve asked <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> server operators to stop providing services that falsify the contents of a player's profile or inventory, like letting them have temporary ownership of items that aren't in their inventory. We will continue to monitor the players experience on community servers, and may reevaluate if further actions need to be taken to ensure that server operators comply, it warned in the <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/server_guidelines/\">Server Operation Guidelines</a>. And It would now seem that Reevaulation Day has come. The first indication that the hammer had fallen came a few days ago by way of the <a href=\"http://csgo-servers.1073505.n5.nabble.com/Anyone-else-hit-with-a-GSLT-ban-td11149.html\">CSGO_Servers mailing list</a>, when server operators began reporting surprise bans of server login tokens. That led to a beefy <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/42xzlo/valve_blacklisting_csgo_community_servers_for/\">Reddit thread</a> and a debate about whether Valve's warning included completely custom weapon models, which some operators thought were allowed, and complaints that some of the banned servers simply had inactive plugins sitting in a disabled directory. Despite some operators' claims that the server restrictions don't cover their specific circumstances, Valve appears to be drawing a hard line in the sand. In January 2016, we permanently disabled Game Server Login Tokens belonging to server operators that were providing free or paid services that falsified the contents of a player s profile or inventory. The Steam user that generated the tokens is now also permanently restricted from creating new GSLTs, it wrote. A new Steam user account associated with a new qualifying phone number (<a href=\"http://www.steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers\">http://www.steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers</a>) will be required to create new GSLTs. To avoid future disruption game server operators are best advised to comply with CS:GO server operation guidelines described above. Some Redditors think Valve's crackdown is harsh and punitive, especially against a game that itself originated as a mod,&nbsp;but a large number of others don't seem to mind, or at the very least appear to think that Valve's warning was a sufficient heads-up that shenanigans will not be tolerated. Valve itself took to the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4378gz/valve_clarifies_that_custom_weapons_arent_allowed/czgqsxk\">CS:GO subreddit</a> to point out that there hasn't been any change to its policy, although an update to the post (which has since been corrected) could be taken to indicate that there was. Innovation is awesome and almost every mod we see is fine, the rep said. Our only concern, as the community correctly understands, is with mods that specifically misrepresent a player's skill group/rank or the items they own. Govern yourselves accordingly, as they say. ",

        "contents": "Call-outs <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;id=157442340\">Here's an overview of the map</a>, including call-outs that are helpful to know. Cobblestone has seen many iterations over the years. Up until this current version, it's been heavily CT-sided. Since this isn't the case anymore, you will have to be a bit more creative if you want to score those rounds. First, let's talk about the map itself. Most games tend to be centered around the B-site. There are several reasons for this. First of all it's easy to isolate defending players on B with smokes. Secondly the terrorists will generally use AK47 whereas you are stuck with M4A4 or M4A1-s. They can prefire the most common angles with a weapon that has the potential to kill you with a single bullet. You will have to react to them stepping out, and if you're fast enough you will still have to hit them at least twice. Then you have the stairs between B-halls and mid. If they rotate from B to A they can simply drop down the stairs and be there in no time. It takes a lot longer to run up the stairs and rotate from A to B. The lone soldier on A Unless you notice that the terrorists have a tendency to attack A, I would recommend to play with only one defender on A. His job will be to support the B-players as much as he can as well as to push for information and call for backup if needed. A lot of the time he won't need his smoke, so he can throw it over to B and smoke off long. That way you'll have four smokes ready on B. After that he should sit around corners at CT ramp, long A or stairs. He will listen for footsteps and check for flashes and smokes. If he thinks that they're coming to A, he should try to survive for as long as possible. If the B-players manage to take control over long B or other key areas around B, the A-guy can fall back to the bombsite and one of the players from B can rotate and support him. If he can't see or hear anyone he can try to move in for the backstab through Z. If he does, timing is crucial. Wait for the terrorists to initiate their attack, or else there s a good chance they will have at least one player waiting for the lurker coming in from behind. Should problem arise over at B, your brave soldier from A shouldn t hesitate. He can either go in through connector door and call for a flash from drop room or throw the flash himself. This flash will blind any terrorist tucked in the corner outside door, making it a lot easier to initiate the retake attempt. <em>On the next page: getting creative around B.</em> Creative B-plays If you decide to play with only one player at A, you will have four players at your disposal for some really creative B-plays. For starters you want to go for less obvious angles and try your best to cause <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eC8ASAnzhM\">communication breakdown</a> (great song, great band, great hair!) and force the terrorists to check more angles. Boosting a player up on top of the cube is one way to achieve this effect. That player will also be able to peek over most of the smokes that the terrorists might use: If your opponents have a tendency to push long B, you can slow them down with a smoke, followed by a molotov and a flash. Stand next to the cube and throw the smoke. After that you can line up the molotov and call for a flashbang from a teammate. What will happen is that your enemies will get blinded and hopefully back off to the corner just outside arch. If that's the case, they won't know that they're slowly burning to death! Even if they don't you will slow down the push, allowing both the A-player to move in from behind and the guys around drop to be a little creative. Used with proper timing the boost from drop room can be lethal, but remember: it's a risk! First of all you want to lay down a smoke screen before you boost, unless the boost is used to peek for information. Try to smoke sometimes even if you don't boost. That way it will be more difficult for the terrorists to read the play when you actually go for it. Drop room can be quite tricky to defend. I like to have one player just outside and one close to connector, ready to assist. If you stand inside drop, chances are you will get flashed and subsequently killed without being able to help your team at all that round. This flash can work wonders. Try it a few times and you'll get the timing right. If the terrorists turn their backs, you will turn those backs into swiss cheese. If they don't, they won't be able see a thing and you can just finish them off. Be careful! It's tempting to hide inside the hen house and try to be a little sneaky. But remember that a single molotov will force you out in the open to a very disadvantageous position where you can consider yourself lucky if you're able to fire even a single bullet. You have to be careful when you try to lurk around the map. If the A-player gets caught with his pants down, you might not have enough time to rotate over to A. And even if you do, they might turn around and attack B instead. Cobblestone is a map where you really need all your players alive until your opponents commit to one site. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Almost a decade ago, I found a gamemode for Counter-Strike called KZ - short for Kreedz Climbing . A few months ago I stumbled upon it again, this time in CS:GO, and I instantly fell in love with it. Players compete to climb increasingly complex level geometry, testing their understanding of Counter-Strike s movement mechanics. The more I played the more intrigued I became and it only felt natural to dig a little deeper into the competitive aspect of KZ. To that end I spoke to Kenneth, founder of <a href=\"http://www.kz-climb.com/index.php\">kz-climb.com</a>, and ruben - one of the most prominent climbers in the scene. \"KZ is a custom game mode for Counter-Strike that involves difficult jumps and hard obstacles. The goal is to traverse through the map with the fastest time. However, for many maps, even reaching the finish point is a challenge in itself\" Kenneth tells me. As ruben puts it: it's basically like parkour for CS:GO.\" The ultimate goal for a climber is to beat world records. To hold a global record for an official map carries prestige and takes a lot of practice. If you put in a lot of hours, blood, sweat and tears you might find yourself on top of the map crowned the new champion of the world. One of those champions is ruben, a humble guy from Sweden. 'crouched bhops' A technique that allows you to pick up speed by chaining together multiple crouch-jumps to bunny hop. <b style=\"background-color: initial;\">PCG:</b> You hold some global records. Which ones are you most proud of and why? <strong>ruben:</strong> I do. I'd say i'm most proud of my kz_haki_v2 run. It took me weeks if not months to get it down below seven minutes. Unfortunately Valve changed crouched bhops in a patch a while ago. As it is right now, it might not be beaten any time soon. Other than that, I think my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6ct5nkccY\">kz_gigablock_go record</a> is solid. <strong>PCG: </strong>What does it take to get good at KZ? <strong>ruben:</strong> I have played kz for about eight years and still have some issues. For example, people make fun of my long-jumps all the time. It definitely takes a lot of practice to get good at it. And a lot of patience... records won't come easy these days. More than jumping The basic idea of a long-jump is to manipulate the physics of the game in order to be able to jump further than you normally can. You do it by strafing before you jump and while you're still in the air. I don't claim to be an expert (or even good, for that matter) but here's an example of the technique: \"There is a lot more depth to KZ than simply jumping onto blocks until you make it to the end. Kenneth says. In many cases, players will need to make use of advanced movement techniques such as strafing, long-jumps, bunnyhops, and much more to complete the map. To add even another layer of difficulty, some players choose to do PRO runs, which are runs done without the use of any checkpoints.\" \"My personal favorite part about KZ is the competition he continues. There are currently hundreds of maps released for KZ, and each one has a global leaderboard. Players compete with other players from all around the world and new global records are set daily. This, along with weekly released maps, means that there's always something exciting going on in the KZ community.\" We talked a little about Kenneth's website, <a href=\"http://www.kz-climb.com/index.php\">kz-climb.com</a>. \"It's an internet forum where players can gather and discuss the game mode. There is a whole array of active members, ranging from beginners who would like to get better, to KZ veterans who want to prove their skill.\" It's also a good resource for players who wants to improve their game. \"In the forum, you can find tutorials on how to execute specific movement techniques, discuss the official released maps, watch the latest world record runs, or just talk about anything related to KZ Kenneth says. People who are new might be intimidated by the whole competitive aspect of KZ, but the KZ-Climb forum provides a friendly place where players can chat about their favorite game.\" As the founder of a large KZ community, Kenneth has seen a lot of record runs over the years. I asked him which record he finds the most impressive. \"The most insane run is inarguably eightbO's PRO run of kz_cursedjourney in 20:43.25 he says.&nbsp; kz_cursedjourney is a famous map known for its unparalleled difficulty. The majority of players who attempt it cannot even reach a quarter of the map, and those that do finish take an average of over two hours. What makes this run especially impressive is that eightbO manages to complete it without using a single checkpoint.\" Advice for new players Find a server <a href=\"http://www.houseofclimb.com/\">Here</a> are some climb servers in both North America and Europe. <strong>Kenneth:</strong> Definitely start with the easy maps. I recommend the maps kz_beginnerblock_go, kz_frozen_go, kz_summercliff2_go, and kz_j2s_westbl0ck. These maps are all designed to give beginners a good feel of what KZ is and help you practice jumping and positioning. Learning how to airstrafe correctly is also very important. Airstrafing lets you control your movement while in the air and is useful to jump around corners. There are many tutorials online for it. <strong>ruben:</strong> Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are always admins online and even better players often help people through the voice coms in-game. And you need patience. Lots of it. I would strongly recommend climbing a few maps. Not only is it great fun, but it also helps you in normal games: being able to maneuver your character smoothly will help you win a lot of duels. Also, there are some really cool jumps on the competitive maps that you won't be able to land unless you learn some of these techniques.

        "contents": "Call-Outs <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;id=157442340\">Here's an overview of the map</a>, including call-outs that are helpful to know. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-defend-on-csgos-overpass-map\">Last time</a> we had a look at some cool tricks as CT on Overpass. Now it's time to indulge in the fine art of attacking the very same map. My philosophy is that it's best to take control over key areas on the map before deciding where to attack. That gives you many more options as well as the freedom to back off again should anything go awry. In my CT guide I identified connector, lower tunnels and outside restroom as the key areas you want to control. This holds true when you're on the T-side as well. If you have connector you can change your mind and attack the other bomb site in a matter of seconds. But that s for later. The important part is how to actually execute the attack. Utility grenades on B A spot you almost always want to smoke off is sniper s nest. I always feel like a fool when I get killed from there because the solution to the problem is rather simple. Note that this smoke is a really neat trick to use in one-on-one situations. Think about it: When the counter-terrorist finds himself alone it makes sense to go sniper s nest because it's close to both A and B. A very common reaction to getting smoked off in snipers nest is to go around down towards jungle. I've won more than one round by using this smoke and then run up through connector and plant the bomb on an empty bomb site on A. You know that counter-terrorist who's on fire behind barrels? The guy who constantly stops you from getting through the pipe in canals? It's time to torch him, literally: After that molotov it won't feel like you're crawling through the sewers anymore. Attacking canals will be a walk in the park. If you know they usually have a guy behind barrels, and you have more time, you can use this boost instead: This will save you the money you'd otherwise spend on a molotov, but after you've used it once they will be prepared for it. That guy might think twice before going barrels again. Sometimes you want to smoke off the bridge to make it easier for your bomb carrier to enter the bombsite: ECO Rounds 'Eco round' is short for economic round. That's a round where you buy little to no items. The purpose is to save money for the following round so that you can afford the big toys. This smoke combined with the smoke on sniper's nest can also be used if you have an eco round and want to get the bomb down for that $4000 bonus ($800 per player.) Be careful, though: they can use the smoke to jump up on the ledge towards the water and sneak up on your guy while he's planting. It can be easy to forget that smokes aren't brick walls. <em>On the next page: controlling A and changing your mind.</em> Lay down a smoke screen on A Bombsite A on Overpass is infamous for all the angles you have to clear when you enter the site. The counter-terrorists can hide on either side of the truck, around the van, inside bank, on the stairs or dance around the boxes. You get the point. Once you attack the site you don't want to have to worry about the guys rotating from B. For that reason you're going to lay down a smoke screen on the back of the site. The first smoke is used to make it less attractive to go up the stairs as well as forcing a guy already peeking from there to change position. An enemy moving between positions is always an easier target. Simply aim slightly above this sign while standing on top of the bench outside restroom: The second smoke is used to smoke off the bank, and can be quite tricky. Hold down the walk key (default is shift) and take two steps before you throw it. Otherwise it will bounce off the box on site and do more harm than good. Where do you want to plant the bomb? On bombsite A it's almost always preferable to plant the bomb towards restroom while using the boxes as cover. If you plant in that spot you can stop the defuse from all angles on the terrorist side of the site. You're often very limited as to where you can plant the bomb on B. You need the cover from the woodblocks in order to get the bomb down safely. Not only is it the safest spot to plant in, but it gives you a lot of options for post-plant positions. You can stand back in canal, hide behind the pillar, fall back to construction or even go down to pit. Final words Like I mentioned earlier, it's important to take control over key areas of the map. Overpass is a map that's all about fast rotations. Use fakes a lot and don't be afraid to fall back if you notice that your opponents have a strong defense on the site you planned to take. Because of how fast the counter-terrorists can get to the other site it's almost always a good idea to have one guy engaging the enemy on the side of the map. Once you notice that the CTs are adapting to your slow style of play you can start playing a little bit faster and sometimes go for a five man attack. They won't rotate straight away if they're used to fakes. GLHF! <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

I am disappointed in the rumored conduct of the players, but for the sake of integrity in Esports, 24/7 Esports does not condone match fixing or even the discussion of it, Esports 24/7 owner Wei-Ning Yong said in a <a href=\"http://www.247esports.com/announcements/247-esports-parts-way-with-counter-strike-global-offensive-team/\">statement</a>. Because of this, we have decided to terminate any support towards the team. Somewhat surprisingly, the move has seemingly been&nbsp;made without any actual proof of match-fixing, and Yong has&nbsp;said he doesn't actually believe any wrongdoing took place. But when there is overwhelming public opinion to the opposite there is no choice but to cease all negotiations, the statement says. The organization wishes the team good luck in their future endeavors and with their quest to make the majors. The decision to halt contract negotiations over unproved allegations may have been driven by the recent <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-makes-csgo-match-fixing-bans-permanent/\">permabanning of 21 CS:GO players</a> who were caught up in a match-fixing scandal in early 2015. Valve initially announced that those suspensions were indefinite and would be reviewed at the start of 2016, but instead of lifting them it dropped the hammer on all involved with permanent bans. In light of that unequivocal stance, 24/7 Esports may well have decided that distancing itself from even the appearance of impropriety was the only move it had.

        "contents": "The Overwatch beta has been gone for a little while, but there are plenty of ways to prepare for the game s return&mdash;or simply to pass the time while you wait for your invite. You can of course read up on heroes and abilities, watch videos or listen to podcasts, but if you re like me you d prefer to jump in right away. Overwatch is not a typical shooter, so get ready to practice your technique in a few different games. Team Fortress 2 After having played Overwatch for a couple weeks, I can happily say that these are two very different games&mdash;but Team Fortress 2 is a close enough match for us to use as a learning tool. Playstyles are generally similar, and certain TF2 classes share close similarities with particular Overwatch heroes. Picking up the Sniper with a bow is a decent way of getting used to the way <strong>Hanzo</strong> has to lead his targets, while using the basic sniper rifle is a good way to hone your <strong>Widowmaker</strong> skills. The Scout is a decent class for learning how to play as <strong>Tracer</strong>, but lacks Tracer s ability to quickly retreat from a dangerous situation. Get used to flanking your opponents and escaping when they turn their focus on you. The similarities between <strong>Junkrat</strong> and the TF2 Demoman are very clear: They both have grenade-like ammunition which requires a very specific set of skills to use correctly. Torbj rn is Overwatch s answer to the TF2 Engineer. Getting used to carefully locking down an area while aggressively defending your turrets is valuable training. Valve s Medic uses the same style of healing as Blizzard s <strong>Mercy</strong>: a healing streamforms between the healer and their target, forcing the two to stick together. The Medic will teach you how to dodge danger while maximising your usefulness. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Overwatch is to Counter-Strike what a Steelseries Rival is to an Apple Magic Mouse. They might technically fall into the same category, but are almost nothing alike when you get your hands on them. The one thing you can get from playing CS in a competitive setting is communication skills. A Counter-Strike match stands or falls with a team s communication so try to focus on that while you use the new R8 Revolver, the gun that gets closest to making you feel like <strong>McCree</strong>. Aim is important in both games, which is the one skill that s very easy to practice in CS:GO. Download <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=dutch&amp;id=213240871\">training_aim_csgo2</a> and try to get a decent score with the M4. Make sure you keep a note of your in-game sensitivity if this is the way you re going to be practising your aim, because you ll want to transfer that over to Overwatch: Arena shooters Everyone who played FPS games in the 90s has played at least one game in the arena shooter genre. The Quake and Unreal series are legends and have inspired many games that look at lot like them. Among those games is Warsow, a personal favorite of mine. The game is fast as hell and has a lot of cool movement mechanics that will teach you how to quickly maneuver yourself through a map: a skill that will come in handy when playing heroes like <strong>Genji</strong>, <strong>Tracer</strong> and <strong>Lucio</strong>. Warsow isn t as popular as Quake so it s harder to find servers with players, but try finding an instagib server with a couple friends and you re guaranteed to have a lot of fun while getting used to the insane pace of the game. Warsow is free and won t take up much space on your PC so there s no reason not to <a href=\"https://www.warsow.gg/\">give it a try</a>! Where are my wizards? Many people have suggested games like Dota or League of Legends as a way to learn cooldown management, but the cooldowns in Overwatch are so low that there s really no point in trying to learn a much more complicated game just to take such a small part of it over to your professional Overwatch career. I do believe any class/role-based team game is a good tool for learning how to play in a team, but unless Overwatch is your first team game, you should already have a vague idea of how that works. Overwatch relies on aim, teamplay and twitchy reflexes so any game that helps you improve those traits is a good way to spend your time while we wait for the beta to return&mdash;and hey, if you don t care about improving at Overwatch, there s always time for Agario. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "In early 2015, Valve <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-19-more-csgo-players-for-match-fixing/\">suspended</a> a number of professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players after it came to light that they'd been involved in fixing matches and betting on the outcomes. A handful of them were ruled ineligible to compete at ESL One Katowice 2015, but at least 21 (including the seven who were <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\">banned in January</a>) were given indefinite suspensions that Valve said would not be reviewed until 2016. Now that 2016 is here, a final ruling has been issued, and it's not happy news for the players involved. Back in January and early February 2015 we took action after we discovered that a small number of professional CS:GO players were engaged in match-fixing. Our decision was to ban these players indefinitely from involvement in Valve-sponsored events, Valve wrote in a <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2016/01/13442/\">CS:GO blog post</a>. To clarify, the bans for these players are permanent, and players proven to have taken part in match-fixing will be permanently banned. As the scene grows, it s an unfortunate reality that some individuals will seek opportunities to take advantage of their fans, the statement says. We will continue to take whatever action we think is necessary to protect the entertainment value created by professional Counter-Strike, including, on occasion, terminating our relationship with individuals who have demonstrated a willingness to exploit their fans faith in the integrity of the sport. While the ban only covers Valve-sponsored events, the likelihood is that it will ultimately extend beyond that. The ESL and ESEA both said that they would honor the suspensions when they were first imposed; the ESL later added that none of the suspended players would be allowed to take part in its CS:GO tournaments until these cases are reviewed by Valve. I've emailed the ESL to confirm that it intends to make the bans permanent as well, but given its willingness to follow Valve's lead with the original suspension, I'd be very surprised if it changes course now.

        "contents": "CALL-OUTS <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;id=157442340\">Here's an overview of the map</a>, including call-outs that are helpful to know. Overpass is a relatively new map that's \"only\" been around for two years. For this reason, and because it s not simply an update of an older design, it's probably one of the least figured-out maps in the current pool. Due to the short rotation paths for the terrorists on Overpass, one could argue that good communication is even more important than usual. When you defend you have to make difficult decisions. Most of the time you'll want to play aggressively and push for information, but be careful. The further you push, the more danger you're in. Think of it as means to an end: a trade-off for information. Once you've cleared an area you should tell your teammates and get ready to either fall back or flank the enemy. Control the map as a team Even if I recommend aggressive play, it's better to stay defensive than to push the wrong areas at the wrong time. When I play CT on Overpass I usually think of my team as a single organism rather than five separate entities. What your A-guys do should dictate how your B-guys play and vice versa. Connector, lower tunnels and restroom are by far the most important areas on Overpass. If you control these spots you can be certain that the terrorists can't rotate unless they decide to get some exercise and run all the way through T-spawn. One of the most effective plays to gather information in lower tunnels is to blow up squeaky and build a tower of death to peek over this wall: Now you'll be able to spot their feet before they can see you. All you need to do now is to shoot them or at the very least make them dance. This play is fairly easy to counter by using flashes and pushing pipe, so don't overuse it. If the terrorists come through the pipe it's crucial that you change positions immediately or else you will have given away the position of not one but two players. Sometimes you can do it like this instead: This provides the same information but it's harder to get the kill. The plus side is that this is less risky than to boost. Remember what I said about your team being a single organism? When you assign one or two B-players to peek lower tunnels, that means your squad on A don't have to work as hard for that paycheck. They can just sit back and make sure no terrorists take over the rest room area. The reason for this is that if you play aggressive on both sides of the map at the same time, you won't be able to rotate in time, should the enemy manage to pick up a few quick kills. Aggressive AWP Sometimes you want to play aggressive towards the fountain for information. The AWP is an excellent weapon for this task. However the AWPer will need a lot of backup, so you should have two guys joining him. One around restroom to make sure the terrorists can't backstab your push from party, the other player using flashbangs to help the sniper get an advantageous peek. If the AWPer spots multiple enemies they should fall back as fast as possible with support from both of their bodyguards. If the terrorists doesn't chase them and push the rest room area, the two guys on B can start to cover more ground. You want the terrorists to have as little space to work with as possible. If they can't see any enemies around fountain, the guy who threw the flashes earlier can clear playground. That way the terrorists are boxed in. Either they're moving towards B or they're in lower tunnels. That should be enough information for your team to have a good chance to secure the round. Cool stuff Sometimes you want to show off to your friends and be the center of attention for a while. This smoke is one of the coolest smokes on Overpass: ECO ROUNDS 'Eco round' is short for economic round. That's a round where you buy little to no items. The purpose is to save money for the following round so that you can afford the big toys. One of your A-guys can use their smoke at the beginning of the round to make it harder for the terrorists to rush B. Especially when you think that they might have an eco round, in which case rushes are quite common. Another cool thing about this smoke is that it gives you an extra smoke on B. Because of the tight choke points on that site, smokes are far more effective there than on A. The infamous one-way smoke. You either love it or hate it. There are examples of smokes like these on a lot of useful spots in the game, but this one qualifies as one of my personal favorites: You can see them, they can't see you. Just don't use it too often or they'll just prefire that angle. This is a play that can win you rounds. I find it especially useful as an anti-eco strategy when my opponents only have pistols. It's rather difficult to hit a head you can't see with a Glock. I mentioned that a great counter for that boost on B is to push through the pipe. With this smoke you can be of great use to your team. Just remember to wait a few seconds into the round before you throw it or else it will fade too early. To summarize: plug the pipes, work as a team and use unfair advantages. Next time we'll go over the terrorist side. Have fun on the field and may the odds be ever in your favor. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Photo credit: ESL/Helena Kristiansson <em>By Henry Stenhouse</em> On March 15th 2015 over one million people tuned in to watch the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Grand Finals at ESL One Katowice. At the previous year s event, viewer numbers peaked at 250,000. In just one year, the number of people watching had quadrupled. But what caused this explosion in viewership? I've collected some of the most entertaining matches and moments from throughout the year. If you're looking for a reason to get into competitive CS, this is it. New blood shines bright: Luminosity Gaming vs Team SoloMid The world map of Counterstrike is dominated by European nations: Denmark, Sweden, Poland and France all field teams of considerable renown. After the only North American team fell in the group stages of DreamHack Winter, it was left to a surprise performance by the Brazilian team Luminosity Gaming to keep American hopes alive. Defeating both EnVyUs and Ninjas in Pyjamas, LG secured a place in the semifinal. Facing the formidable Team SoloMid, they received a crushing 16-5 defeat on Mirage. With the second game taking place on TSM's map of choice, Overpass, the Brazilian dream looked to be over&hellip; Despite a shaky start, LG finally found their form. A combination of patient approaches with blistering flashes of aggression concocted the perfect formula to overcome the Danish defence. Breaking through to map 3, both teams brought their best in a gut wrenching finale. Luminosity may not have left the tournament as champions, but with victories against three of the greatest teams in CS, Brazil has certainly earned its place on the map. Old dogs die hard: Virtus Pro vs Team SoloMid Counter-Strike teams are rarely stable. Replacements and restructures come fast and often. In this regard Virtus Pro are an anomaly, maintaining the same lineup since January 2014. VP's roster also holds a high average age, with three out of five players aged over 27. Without any recent major successes to speak of, questions had begun to rise over how long the beloved Polish side would continue to compete. Enter the Dubai Invitational. Fielding eight of the best teams from across the globe, the event looked to be a tight competition between the two favourites, Fnatic and TSM. VP surpassed all expectations by breezing out of the group stages before scoring a confident 2-1 win over Fnatic. The five map grand final vs TSM proved nothing short of spectacular, with momentum swinging wildly between each side. Virtus Pro excel in flexibility, seemingly any member of their team cable of both rifling and AWPing. The player to watch throughout the event was VP's Janusz 'Snax' Pogorzelski who exhibited exemplary rifling along with inventive use of smoke grenades to secure rounds. Fantastic four: EnVyUs vs Mousesports From the astounding to the amusing, the end of the ESEA Pro League looked to be a disappointing affair after EnVyUs's in-game leader, Vincent 'Happy' Cervoni, received a Denial of Service attack just five rounds in. Incredibly, EnVy decided to persevere with just four players, overwhelming a flustered mousesports to take the match. A bold French performance and some unconventional casting by Lauren 'pansy' Scott and Alex 'machine' Richardson resulted in one of the most entertaining matches of the year. The duo livened the game with everything from speed and minimalist casting to a spectator fly-through race of the map. Individual highlights CS:GO may be a team game, but individual moments of exceptional skill (or luck) often provide the best memories. Here are some of the best from this year: <strong>Nikola 'NiKo' Kova </strong> of team mousesports pulls off a series of phenomenal long range deagle kills to claim an ace and economy win against Titan: <strong>H vard 'Rain' Nygaard </strong>recovers from 1 vs&nbsp;4 to save match point. Surviving on just one point of health, he single handedly keeps Kinguin in the game: NiP's <strong>Patrik 'Forest' Lindberg</strong> locks down Dust2's double doors, earning a knife kill and dispatching four of TSM's roster: Of course no highlight reel for 2015 would be complete without THAT deagle ace by <strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Vincent 'Happy' Schopenhauer</strong>: Honourable mentions <strong>Fnatic</strong> To discuss the greats of CS:GO without mentioning Fnatic is to do a great disservice to the game. The Swedish team have proven themselves the kings of CS time after time. Securing no less than five $100,000 first place victories this year, Fnatic's reign looks far from over. The highlight? Katowice grand finals, map three: <strong>Cloud9</strong> The North American heroes may have run into trouble in the latter stages of the year but during the summer months they were in the form of their lives. Reaching three back to back finals at ESEA Season 1, ESWC 2015 and DreamHack Valencia, the team fell just short of tournament victories in each case. Despite this, C9 garnered key victories over EnVyUs and VP to show they could compete at the top of CS. Here they are at DreamHack Open Valencia: <strong>Human error</strong> After such a deluge of superhuman feats, I feel it's important to remind yourself that these professionals are, at the end of the day, still human. This year's Cluj-Napoca supplied an abnormal number of team kills, collected neatly in this montage by Kevin Tweedale: Averaging 500,000 players daily, CS:GO sits happily at second place on Steam s player chart. With increasing prize pools and MLG Colombus hosting the first North American major in 2016, Counter-Strike s popularity growth shows no signs of slowing. If 2014 was the year CS:GO blossomed, then 2015 has proven to be its tour de force. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

If I have to choose, then it's the M4A4.\" <strong>The Return of the King or Return of the Jedi?</strong> \"Both, only a Sith deals in absolutes.\" <strong>Coffee or tea?</strong> \"Tea. Coffee will make your tail grow out, or so my grandma used to tell me.\" <strong>Clutch plays or solid teamwork?</strong> \"Solid teamwork above all.\" <strong>What's your new year's resolution?</strong> \"I don t really make those to be honest, but let's say I need to lose some weight and improve on a bunch of things related to my work as an analyst.\" There s something special about this time of year. Maybe it s something we ve created for ourselves. Maybe it s part of human nature. Not only do we get to celebrate the holidays, but it s also a time for reflection. We think about the past year. All the goals we had set for ourselves, everything that happened in our lives and of course all the events in the game we all love: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. One thing I love about esports is how much can happen in a short period of time. The amount of tournaments, frequent roster changes and other things surrounding the game all add to the excitement of being a fan of the sport. It s mind boggling that it s not even a year ago that four players from iBUYPOWER got banned after a match fixing scandal that had taken place the previous summer. Nor has a year passed since the insanely close all-Swedish finals between Fnatic and NiP in Katowice during the ESL One Major, where Fnatic eventually managed to win the third map to seal the deal. That deciding map on Inferno is in my mind one of the most memorable moments from 2015. Fnatic were up 14-4 when NiP almost managed a heroic comeback. 16-13 was the final score. One dream crushed, another fulfilled. That's the beauty of our game. But let s not dwell on the past. We have yet another exciting year of CS:GO ahead of us. MLG Columbus, ELeague, and the NA scene The next CS:GO Major will take place at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio, home of the glorious and heroic Blue Jackets (fanboy: a fan that lets his passion override social graces). To uncover what this means for the North American scene I asked the up and coming CS:GO analyst Janko 'YNk' Paunovic, famous for his in-depth play-by-play breakdowns. \"I don't think it will have that big of an influence. Maybe the ELeague if it offers more spots for NA teams. That would give some less-known teams like Splyce, Enemy or the former 3-sUP team, who all have the potential to break through in my opinion, a chance to play against top teams and gain that much needed experience.\" What is ELeague, then? It's the result of a collaboration between the two media companies Turner and WME | IMG. During 2016 there will be two seasons with a prize pool of $1.2 million per season, making it the biggest league in CS:GO history money-wise. \"I hope that this will motivate NA teams even more, so that we can see other teams besides Luminosity being a threat to the EU teams.\" From what we've seen so far in the first <a href=\"http://www.e-league.com/#fadegallery\">hype video</a> none of the top tier European teams are featured. ELeague could be a great initiative if they go about it the right way. Each season stretches over a ten week period of time. That's a lot of time in esports and consequently a huge commitment. Because of that it's likely that a lot of top teams opt out until ELeague has proven itself. Given that both the MLG Major and ELeague will take place in North America, I asked Janko whether thinks this will affect the level of interest among European fans. \"I don't feel that the level of interest will change. The majors are highlights of the year in CS:GO. EU fans might however not be able to watch as many games because of timezone differences.\" He adds, \"from what I've seen at IEM San Jose, I expect a big crowd and a great atmosphere.\" Changes to the game and map pool We talked about the weapon changes that have been a hot topic ever since the infamous <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-highs-and-lows-of-csgos-winter-update/\">Winter Update</a>. \"Well, they reverted those changes, but I feel that the pistol changes were okay. The Glock nerf was unnecessary and the tec-9 could've been nerfed even more in my opinion.\" Valve also decided to make changes to the most popular assault rifles in an attempt to make sprays less effective. \"As for the rifle nerfs I agree with the idea, but I feel that they went about it the wrong way. In my opinion, randomness is not good for a game like CS, it's just counter intuitive.\" A lot of people have requested a remade version of the map Nuke in the official map pool. I asked Janko how he felt about this topic. \"Personally, I don't think Nuke was that bad of a map, I think teams weren't creative enough on their T sides, which resulted in big results for the CT's. I also disagree that if a map is to be good for competitive play it has to be 'side balanced'. For me Nuke was fun to watch because of how good some teams were as CT, hence making it look easy.\" Side balance is often discussed within the community and the popular opinion is that maps should be as balanced as possible. Good arguments can be made on both sides of the fence and it will be interesting to see what Valve decides to do next. \"I would like to see Tuscan back in the map pool, that map was really fun to both play and watch.\" No matter what we think about changes to the game and upcoming tournaments, it's impossible to deny that the scene is only getting bigger. The number of viewers is steadily increasing. The prize pools are growing,&nbsp;albeit slowly. There's no reason not to think that we're in for a treat in 2016.

        "contents": "In CS:GO there are a few things that separate the good players from the bad: aim, economic knowledge, movement and last but not least, gamesense. Counter-Strike&mdash;like many other competitive games&mdash;requires equal parts technical skill and intelligence. Gamesense is a direct extension of the latter. Before you can start popping heads on the regular you need to know where those heads are and what they re carrying. What is gamesense? Gamesense is really just a another word for instinct. It s the knowledge of how your game is progressing and how your teammates and your opponents are playing. Gamesense allows you to make a judgement about where your opponents are on the map and what kind of gear they re carrying. If your gamesense is good enough, you ll have a much easier time getting into bombsites, clutching rounds and countering flanking maneuvers. Gamesense is a combination of economic knowledge and map knowledge, so in order to improve your gamesense you ll need to learn more about both those things. Don t worry about losing a couple games while you learn Economic knowledge Economic knowledge is easy to develop. Try to remember what your opponents were carrying after every round and keep an eye on the win/loss chart on the scoreboard. If your opponents just lost two rounds where they were carrying full loadouts, it s safe to assume they ll buy pistols this round. Did you just drop a few rounds? Then look out for AWPs because your opponents are flush with cash and ready to roll. The best way to get a feel for how the CS:GO economy works is by looking through your own demos and seeing how your opponents tend to spend their money. When you reach a higher rank you ll notice that your opponents and your teammates follow the unwritten economy rules a lot more closely, increasing the accuracy with which you can estimate your opponent s gear. Map knowledge Map knowledge is a little harder to develop due to the sheer number of maps you have to study. Another reason why map knowledge isn t learned as quickly as economic knowledge is the fact that you have to learn two different sides of a map equally well. Take the time to go through the learning process map for map and don t worry about losing a couple games while you learn. Take it from StarCraft veteran WhiteRa: more GG, more skill. What's Pre-aiming? Pre-aiming is the art of aiming at locations where you expect opponents to be playing from before you ve actually seen them, allowing you to shoot them immediately instead of having to snap your crosshair onto them. Watch and learn I ve mentioned watching demos a few times as a way to improve your gamesense. There s a good reason why I believe demos are such an invaluable part of refining this part of your skillset. It s impossible to give you one way to improve your gamesense that will work for every player at every rank. Playstyles simply differ too much to write one guide that covers all the bases. If you ve ever seen a high-ranked player fail horribly at smurfing on the lower ranks, you ll know what I m talking about. High-ranked players expect their opponents to adopt a playstyle they know how to counter because nearly everyone on their rank is playing that style. When those players then play against people of a lower rank, it takes them time to get used to their opponents not defending bombsites from the optimal positions, making it hard to pre-aim when attempting an entry. This knowledge, combined with your newfound economic understanding, grants you special clairvoyant powers The only truly reliable way to get a real understanding of how people at your rank are playing is by watching your own demos. Who better to show you how your opponents play than your opponents? If this is your first time attempting to improve by watching your demos, here s some advice. You ll want to start by finding a demo of a close game. You re not going to learn anything from watching a game where you were on fire the entire time, dropping 50 frags and getting knife kills every other round. You ll also have a hard time finding flaws in your game when your opponents were much better than you and you lost without winning a single round. A game where you barely lost is great for learning purposes. You were matched against a team of nearly equal skill and were just unable to pull out the victory. Watching the replay will let you understand why. As terrorists Let s start off by looking at your terrorist side. Compare your buying choices on the pistol round with our <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/choosing-the-right-pistol-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\">pistol guide</a> and then look at the angles your opponents were holding. If you spot a position you ve never seen before, make a note of it and move on. You re going to want to do this for a few demos in order to find out which spots are common and thus should be checked when attempting to storm a bombsite. Those one-off spots your opponents sometimes choose to play are a lot less important than whichever locations are more popular at your rank. Repeat this process for every standard round and you ll end up with a pretty good idea of how counter-terrorists defend their bombsites at the level that you re playing. You ll also notice that playstyles heavily depend on loadouts, so keep track of what players are carrying too. This knowledge, combined with your newfound economic understanding, grants you special clairvoyant powers (or, at the very least, a better chance of winning.) As counter-terrorists We want to focus on getting a good feel for where the terrorists are moving on the map and what that means for your defence. Once again we turn to our demos. While watching your CT-side, two things are important: how your opponents attempt to take bombsites and how they defend bombsites afterwards. Note-keeping is the solution to figuring out which types of attacks are most common and require special attention. Keep an eye out for how your opponents are moving before they start an attack so you can call it out to your team before the assault even happens. Being able to do this will make you invaluable to any team you come across in matchmaking. When your team does lose a bombsite, you are forced into the most difficult position in the game: retaking. Look at your demos for common spots the terrorists like to use in order to defend their explosives and check those first when attempting to retake a bombsite. A single demo doesn t tell you much, so take the time to watch a few of your own demos and make it a habit as you rank up. When you notice your ability to predict your opponents playstyle slipping, look at your demos and note the differences. Keep doing this and you ll start adjusting your playstyle without even thinking about it, making you a much better player in the process. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Map Callouts <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=157442340\">Here's an overview of the map</a> including callouts that are helpful to know. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/defending-csgos-cache-map-as-counter-terrorists/\">Last time</a> we had a look at how to defend on Cache. Now it's time to figure out how to level the brick walls that the counter-terrorists have built. When you play Cache it's beyond important to understand that the map consists of three major choke points where you will battle it out with the defenders: A-main, mid and B-halls. Even if the occasional rush could work, I prefer to have presence at all of these chokepoints during the early stages of the round. The reason for this is that your opponents can shut your rush down quite easily with smokes, flashes and molotovs. If you find yourselves waiting behind a smoke, the defenders on the other side of the map can push and call out that you're not there. Next thing you know you're trapped like rats&mdash;and hungry cats are approaching from all directions. Cache is a map where information wins you games. When you spread out you should gather as much information as you can. After a while you should have a rough idea of where the CTs are. Even more importantly, you know how much information they have and you've made sure they can't sneak up on you. Freedom through mid control If you get a kill in mid you slow down the counter-terrorists' potential quick rotation to either site. Even if you don't get a kill, but take control over mid, they need to assign at least one player to make sure you can't push anywhere without them knowing. This will also slow them down significantly. At this point, a kill on either B or A is huge. If your B-guy wins his duel, you can support him through vent and take over the site before the counter-terrorists get a chance to react. If the A-guy gets a kill on A, you can support him from highway. You get the point: mid control means freedom and flexibility. How do you take control over mid then? If the CTs smoke mid, you can boost a guy up to clear the area below vent or simply wait for the smoke to fade. Either way it could be a good idea to boost a player, as long as you don't do it every round and make it predictable. That player can peek over this smoke wall while two terrorists push out from garage: Even though mid control is a huge advantage, you don't want to go for that every round. If you notice that your enemies start to put up a greater defense in mid, you want to put more pressure on one of the sites instead. <em>On the next page: trying your luck at bombsites A and B.</em> Cool flash from squeaky For one reason or another you decide that you want to try your luck at A. Card counting might be illegal and can get you a lot of trouble&mdash;if you get caught that is. This flash from squeaky can shift the odds in your favor: This flash is especially effective if combined with a smoke towards highway. It's a lot harder to turn away from a flash that you can't see. You can potentially flash enemies behind forklift, on catwalk, on site or behind quad, with one flashbang. Use the flash to push out from door and clear the site. Trust your teammates to take care of any counter-terrorists lurking in the area around forklift. This gives you a fast and effective access to A-site. Molotovs are great if you want to clear areas without having to push too far. If you assign two players to throw these molotovs you can clear both quad and NBK: This leaves you with two fewer spots to worry about when you take the site. You'll only have to clear site, catwalk and forklift which shouldn't be a problem if you still have five players alive (assuming you smoked off the area between forklift and the red container). Smokes on B B-site can be tricky to take if you don't know whether there's someone lurking in vent or not. If you get taken by surprise by a timed backstab from vent, your attack might get slowed down enough to allow the rotation to arrive before you get the bomb down. Again, mid control is very helpful. You should have at least one guy going checkers to clear vent and all the corners in there. His job is also to make sure his teammates don't get flanked while throwing their smokes. These two smokes can be really effective, especially if you're facing an AWP on either upper or lower. Plant and post-plant positions Once you have taken control over a site you have to assess the situation. Do we have enough time to plant the bomb out in the open before the rotation moves in? If yes you should try to get the bomb down in one of these spots: If you on the other hand think that there is a risk the CTs will get there in time, you should plant in a safer spot. Better safe than sorry. This will however leave you with fewer options for post-plant positions. For instance, you don't want to find yourself in a one on one situation where you are in checkers with sweaty palms, feeling the pressure from your team while the bomb is planted behind one of the boxes on B-site. You can hear the defuse, you hesitate for a second, decide to go for it but you don't make it in time. Not only did you fail to stop the defuse, you also lost your precious weapon and armor. If you plant in one of the spots shown above, an otherwise bad post-plant position can turn into a really strong one. This is especially true for A-main on A and checkers on B. As you can see there are many factors that decide the outcome of a round. Hopefully you can use your new knowledge to your advantage.

        "contents": "Valve <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-winter-update-adds-festively-obscene-pistol/\">just released</a> the Winter Update for CS:GO. You can find the full patch notes <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/12/13325/\">here</a>. Before we dive into any sort of analysis I want to say that I think it's a good thing that they frequently update the game and try out new ideas. That way we avoid a static meta-game. However, Valve tends to change the game too much with each update and this one is no exception. R8 Revolver The newest addition to the arsenal is a high caliber revolver that's almost as powerful as the AWP and with longer accurate range than the AK47. With this gun, Valve effectively removed the value of eco rounds. Even if you don't win the round, chances are you will damage your opponent s economy severely. At the moment the price tag is set to $850, which means you can't buy it on pistol rounds. Other than this, the only downside of the R8 Revolver is the low rate of fire and the length of the trigger-pulls. At close and medium range the R8 is a one-shot kill to the chest against a fully armored enemy. Combined with a grenade, you can one-shot players even if you hit the arm: In that sequence I used $1150 to kill an enemy who spent $4750 plus utility, without any problem. That is, in my mind, ridiculous. And it gets worse. The gun has a secondary fire that's less accurate, a lot faster and allows you to shoot while defusing the bomb. I suspect that this wasn t intended, but either way, it needs to be fixed: Clearly, the R8 Revolver needs to change. I say change because Valve can't remove it from the game&nbsp;due to the Steam market. The Winter Update included the Revolver Case as well, which means players already have invested a lot of money on skins for the new gun. The skins in the case <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/12/13288/\">can be found here</a>. If they were to remove the weapon entirely they would have to refund any money spent on skins for the R8: not only to the steam wallet, but to player's bank accounts. So, how could they change the R8 Revolver? For starters they could increase the price tag. Then they could make it even slower, but I'm not sure that would help. The other way they can go is to make it less powerful than the Desert Eagle but keep the secondary fire, otherwise they'd just have a copy of the same gun. At the same time they decided to reduce accuracy when you run and shoot with Dual Elites, Fiveseven, Glock, P2000, P250, Tec9, USP and CZ75a. What this means is that Glock and Tec9 pushes will be less efficient than they used to be and we will probably see changes to the metagame for T-side pistol rounds as a consequence. Every cloud has a silver lining The Winter Update includes some changes to the game that I really like. One is the changed round and bomb times. The bomb time is now 0:40 in both Competitive Matchmaking (previously 0:45) and in Major Championships (previously 0:35). For the casual gamer this means you have to decide if you want to go for the defuse or save your gun earlier than before. I welcome this change because in my opinion the counter-terrorists had way too much time on their hands to retake a bomb site after the plant. How will this affect pro play? First of all, smoke grenades and molotovs won't be as powerful, which will add more excitement for spectators. I think it's safe to say that these five extra seconds will result in more insane clutch plays for us to enjoy. Another update is that Valve added the option to vote for a 60 second timeout in Competitive Matchmaking. This is great if you have lost a couple of rounds in a row. You get some time to analyse your and your opponents' play and figure out what you have to adjust in order to bring the game back. As an in-game leader of an amateur team I love this. Even if I don't play Matchmaking that much anymore, I could absolutely have used this in order to improve faster. This is good for the scene and all budding in-game leaders out there. First person footsteps are quieter while third person footstep volume remains unchanged. The adjustment is ever so slight but it's still helpful. Listening for footsteps is a huge part of the game, contributing to its tactical dimension. In addition, the recovery times for AK47, M4A4 and M4A1-s have been increased, making it more important to be on point with your initial bullets. I look forward to more highlight clips from sick aimers such as Titan's star player Adil \"ScreaM\" Benrlitom. The Winter Update brought some really good and welcome changes to the game. Unfortunately, the biggest change turned out to be not just awful but downright bad for the health of CS:GO. I hope that Valve will revamp the R8 Revolver within the next few days.

Well, it's too early to call OP on the new Desert Eagle-slot&nbsp;R8, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\">Counter-Strike</a> sure is sexing it up: The R8 costs a mere $850 and a body shot will be enough to drop anyone, regardless of&nbsp;body&nbsp;armour.

        "contents": "CALL-OUTS <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=157442340\">Here s an overview of the map</a>, including call-outs that are helpful to know. Cache differs from most other maps in that it s rectangular with two distinct sides separated by the yard in the middle. What does this mean when you try to defend? Firstly, if you manage to maintain control over mid, the terrorists are a lot more limited in what they can do to get the bomb to one of the bomb sites. And secondly, if the terrorists manage to kill the defenders in mid, the counter-terrorists will have to move across the entire map to reach the other site. Needless to say, mid is a key area on Cache whether you re defending or attacking. Before we move on to discuss how to defend different areas on the map, it s worth mentioning that there are a number of different ways to set up on Cache. There's no correct way. One method that I prefer is to have one defender on B, whose job it is to survive long enough to either get help from the rotation from mid or be able to call out the terrorists' positions for when the rest of their team attempts a retake. Two defenders on A, because that site allows for a number of cool strategies that two players can use if they work together. Finally, two players in mid. You can either rotate both mid players to one site if your enemies are rushing, or you can rotate one without giving up control over mid completely. Dynamic duo on bombsite A The most important thing to do when you defend A with someone is to communicate. You want to know what the other player intends to do so that you don t stay and peek the A-main entrance from car while your friend decides to go ham out of nowhere and rush them without your assistance. One way you can set up is to have a player behind forklift. This spy can spot attacks from either door or A-main, but more importantly, they can hear the push from A-main before they arrive. When the warning arrives, use this flash from the corner. For good reasons, it's nicknamed after the French player NBK (Natural Born Killer). If you notice that your enemies tend to go for mid control, you can use this smoke and flash in order to be able to safely boost up one guy on top of the boxes. The other player can then go either highway or balcony and hold door, until their assistance is needed in mid. Being flexible is everything on Cache. This way the player on boxes can hopefully kill one or two enemies, should they push A despite your masterful read. Warning! If your mid defense falls, you have to drop down or else you ll be a sitting duck when the terrorists attack from highway. <em>On the next page: holding mid and bombsite B.</em> Almost-as-dynamic duo in mid It s often good to have one guy close to garage, ready to pop vent and assist on B or sneak up behind soon-to-be-surprised terrorists and go for the backstab. To make this possible, you need one guy further back around white box, sandbags or connector to assist with flashbangs and other utility grenades. Maybe even an AWP. But make sure you sometimes play with two players further back. If the terrorists are able to read your aggressive play, they can put up a smoke wall in mid, walk out of garage and completely obliterate the poor guy below vent. If you know that your fearless enemies have pushed out of garage, you can use this flash and hopefully pick up a kill or two. All enemies looking at white box will be flashed, regardless of the angle. Sometimes one of the mid players can go for a cool play in vent, especially if you have an AWPer, who then can focus on boost and leave garage to the vent guy. We ll come back to this soon. Solo B defense: the glorious hero of your team The player on the B-site must be smart. They will need to both spot the attack in time and survive long enough for the rotation to move in. To do this they can dance with the terrorists using the site boxes. They might even be able to pick up a kill or two. It s true that it s much easier to hold B with two players, but as long as you have a rotation ready you can enjoy the benefits of having two players in both mid and on A without paying too high a price. Remember that vent play I mentioned earlier? The mid player will need the glorious hero on B to boost them into vents. The B player can use this smoke and possibly a flashbang as well before boosting. You might feel quite lonely at times when you play B, but you have to stay there until you're certain the terrorists will attack A. I have lost a lot of rounds because I rotated too early from B. What if the terrorists manage to control mid round after round? It is believed that Albert Einstein once defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. If you notice that you continuously fail to hold mid, don't contest it. Place an AWP behind quad to defend highway, like this: One player will remain hidden inside connector so that they can hear steps in mid. If they come close, they can use this flash and go for a kill. If you choose this approach you can either have three players on A or two players on B.

At that point it will be a lot easier for you to pick a bomb site and execute your meticulously planned operation. First, though, let's have a look at the pistol round. Pistol round If you manage to win the pistol round it'll be much easier for you to ride the economy wave and pick up the following rounds as well. There are an infinite number of pistol round strategies, but this is one that I like to use. From the hip If you need to improve your pistol game, check out <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/choosing-the-right-pistol-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/\">our guide</a>. You need one guy to buy armor. He will be crucial for this strategy to work. No matter what happens, there's no way this player will let counter-terrorists push banana. In the beginning of the round, his job is to survive and create some space for the rest of the team. The support player will buy a smoke grenade and two flashbangs and the rest of the team can buy whatever they prefer to use. These four guys will be the main squad. They will go through second mid up to mid. Once they're in position, the support player will use this smoke and these flashes to prevent the defenders from pushing through the smoke screen. After the flashes he will join his sidekick in banana while the rest of the team rush through CT-spawn. Now your dumbstruck opponents on B will have to defend against attacks from both sides. <em>On the next page: an effective way to take B.</em> Simple but effective B-take For this round you will need at least two smokes (if you buy more you can use them in mid to fake A or save them to buy more time after the bomb plant). Don't forget to pick up a few flashbangs. A molotov can be really useful to clear sandbags in banana. Either you're gonna toast the enemy hiding there or he's going to look down the barrels of your AK47s, say a quick prayer and embrace the afterlife. Once you have taken control over banana you will smoke off CT-spawn and spools. Flash over the roof and towards CT-spawn before you push. The first guy to go in will clear first, second and new box and eventually shadows, like this: Assign one or two players to make sure the defenders can't attack through the smokes. The bomb carrier will plant the bomb on the grill since you have control over the banana side of the site. This way, any counter-terrorist trying to defuse the bomb will be a sitting duck when you take the peek from any angle, including banana. <em>On the next page: taking A with sturdy chipmunks.</em> A-split In this strategy you want two players to help each other to take control over apartments. They are the Chip and Dale of your team. Dale, being the wild one, will jump up to window room, clear bedroom and then peek down boiler stairs. Chip, the patient one, will make sure no one can backstab Dale in window room. As soon as Dale peeks down boiler stairs, Chip will have his time to shine. Now it's his job to try to kill the potential counter-terrorist in halls. While your sturdy chipmunks do their thing, two players will wait just below the top of middle. If you manage to find a kill in apartments you should smoke off arch side and push as fast as possible. If, on the other hand, you don't find a counter-terrorist in apartments you can smoke and flash truck side instead. This will make it easier to either take the site fast from truck side or split push from arch side and apartments. Remember that you have to go fast. Don't let the rotation get to the site in time. The fifth player will make sure that no one pushes down banana, but as soon as it's time to go he'll join the main squad in middle. Pay attention! Tread carefully Footsteps are a huge part of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. If you step too close to your enemy you will give away your position. This is especially important to bear in mind at the top of banana and in apartments. You have tried to execute these strategies a couple of times, but every time you find yourselves getting caught off guard by a fast rotation. If this is the case you can use it to your advantage. A team that rotates early is especially vulnerable to fakes. Try to get a kill and use utility grenades on one site before you fall back and attack the other one. If you notice that your opponents are particularly weak on one site&mdash;abuse that fact! Either they'll adapt, in which case you attack the other site, or you will cash in round after another. Good luck out there and remember, show no mercy! <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Photo credit: Dreamhack/Benjamin Cotton Since writing <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/police-called-to-dreamhack-winter-2015-over-alleged-assault/\">yesterday's article</a> about the violent altercation between CS:GO panelist Richard Lewis and Dota 2 pro player Jonathan 'Loda' Berg at DreamHack Winter 2015, I've been contacted by DreamHack offering further comment. \"We can confirm that an incident did occur between both parties\" writes DreamHack's Michael Van Driel \"and that at Loda's request we contacted the police so an official report could be filed.\" \"We had two staff members who witnessed the altercation between Richard Lewis and Jonathan Berg. Lewis and Kelly Milkies had been in an argument, Kelly had left the scene extremely upset and our staff were explaining to Richard Lewis how these types of yelling matches are not appropriate behaviour for our events. At this time then Jonathan Berg aggressively approached Richard Lewis and the two began to yell at one another, until Richard grabbed Jonathan's neck and began to strangle it, and then our staff intervened to end the physical confrontation.\" DreamHack's witnesses do not believe that Berg touched Lewis before Lewis grabbed him. Van Driel writes: \"From what we witnessed it was Richard who initiated physical contact. Loda could be described as 'in his face' but did not initiate physical contact.\" This account differs from what Lewis <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/670620022822330368\">said on Twitter</a> at the time and what he told me via e-mail yesterday. When asked to clarify exactly what Loda did, Lewis wrote: Backstage Loda's girlfriend had come over first and was berating me and I told her in blunt terms to go away and that if her boyfriend approached me I'd tell him the same. I then informed DreamHack about what was happening on Twitter and was talking about the veiled threats of I'll come and see you or whatever. He walked over in the middle of that conversation shouting what joke did you make about my girlfriend and came and stood as close to me as possible. No one intervened. He moved his head towards me until it was touching my face, so I grabbed him. Van Driel states that DreamHack's response was \"to separate both individuals and do a full investigation of what occurred and involve both DreamHack security crew, and police. After long discussions and considerations of a lot of different options, our response for the event was going to be that both parties would be asked to leave the event, however both Jonathan and Richard were able to speak to one another and shake hands, in which case it was decided against removing both parties for the time being.\" Nonetheless, DreamHack will not be working with Richard Lewis again. \"Moving forward DreamHack's very quickly reached the conclusion that we will no longer be hiring or working with Richard Lewis indefinitely,\" Van Driel writes. \"We cannot condone violent behaviour at our events. Jonathan will be welcome at all events in the future, however we would like to reiterate that aggressive behaviour is not acceptable.\" <em>Update: around the same time this article was published, DreamHack's Christian Lord posted&nbsp;the following statement on Twitter.</em> I was advised to be silent but I can't stand it anymore. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLewisReports\">@RLewisReports</a> strangled <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LodaBerg\">@LodaBerg</a> and I was the (cont) <a href=\"https://t.co/M6e5dN9uFH\">https://t.co/M6e5dN9uFH</a> &mdash; Hellspawn (@Hellspawnlord) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hellspawnlord/status/671737776711311360\">December 1, 2015</a> <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

In a tweet, Berg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LodaBerg/status/670617290078072833\">claimed to have been strangled</a> by Lewis. In response, Lewis said that he had been provoked when the pro player <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/670620022822330368\">\"pushed his forehead into his face\"</a>. I spoke to a spokesperson for the J nk ping police department this morning. They were not able to confirm the official details of the incident at this early stage but did recall an assault being reported on Saturday. The argument between the two began with this tweet by Lewis: Can someone tell the groupie I kicked out of bed this morning that she left her sign. <a href=\"https://t.co/xbZnpVd2Vx\">pic.twitter.com/xbZnpVd2Vx</a> &mdash; Richard Lewis (@RLewisReports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/670550953121226752\">November 28, 2015</a> Lewis claims to have found the sign discarded the night before and tweeted the photo as a joke at the expense of Team Liquid CS:GO player Hiko. The sign had, however, been made by Kelly Ong Xiao Wei, the manager (and self-described 'mom') of Alliance. \"I was having a bit of fun between myself and Hiko and had no idea who created the sign\" Lewis later told me via e-mail. She challenged Lewis about the joke on Twitter, as did her partner, Berg. Berg then asked Lewis if they could meet up to talk about it. It was while meeting backstage at the event that the alleged assault took place and the police were called. This incident has resulted in fallout on Twitter and in the CS:GO and Dota 2 communities, as might be expected. Berg has been quiet about the issue since Saturday, but Lewis has been more vocal, contending with those who have criticised him and&nbsp;stating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/670947458390822912\">yesterday</a> that \"the way dreamhack handled things and what they asked of me makes it difficult to want to do an event for them again moving forward\". I ve reached out to all three parties involved, but at present only&nbsp;Lewis has responded to my request for comment. His account of the incident is quoted below. \"Backstage Loda's girlfriend had come over first and was berating me and I told her in blunt terms to go away and if her boyfriend approached me I'd tell him the same\" he writes. \"I then informed DreamHack about what was happening on Twitter and was talking about the veiled threats of 'I'll come and see you' or whatever.\" He is referring to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LodaBerg/status/670568044763226113\">two</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LodaBerg/status/670576433903878144\">tweets</a> by Loda. The assertion that these were veiled threats are Lewis' and hard to verify, given the nature of social media. \"He walked over in the middle of that conversation shouting 'what joke did you make about my girlfriend' and came and stood as close to me as possible\" Lewis continues. \"No one intervened. He moved his head towards me until it was touching my face, so I grabbed him.\" \"It's not my proudest moment but I had a split second to make a decision. I don't know this individual or what he is capable of. Had I not felt threatened I wouldn't have acted to defend myself. As it happens after the whole silliness of it all we spoke and apologised to each other. That really should have been the end of it.\" Of his experience with the police, Lewis writes: \"in regards to the police, the player called them as is his right if he felt he was the victim. They interviewed me very briefly, agreed that based on other eye-witness accounts that it was reasonable I might have felt threatened and recorded it as a matter of self defence. They took my details and said it was unlikely any further action would be taken. As I said, it's all a bit silly and it's a shame something so nonsensical as this has overshadowed a great event.\" Lewis expands on his account of the incident by writing that he has felt threatened at events before. \"For a journalist and pundit like myself it's not uncommon to be threatened by players who dislike things that I say about their performance\" he states. \"This has happened to me on several occasions. It wouldn't be the first time someone attacked me at an event. I felt it could spill over into a physical confrontation so I acted on instinct. I regret it obviously but I think it's fair to say there were failings on all sides.\" With this in mind&mdash;and lacking comment from Loda, whose account of the event could easily be different&mdash;I asked Lewis if he regretted that initial Twitter post. After all, calling somebody a 'groupie' that he'd 'kicked out of bed' was always going to hurt somebody, even if it didn't hurt a public figure in the Dota community. \"Friendly trash talking is part of the camaraderie in Counter-Strike\" Lewis writes. \"The difference between joking with people you know and strangers obviously changes context. I will never be overly concerned about causing offence when I express myself and we use humour a lot in what we do for entertainment purposes. Some jokes land, some don't, some upset people, some give everyone a laugh. Knowing where the line is isn't exactly cut and dry.\" \"Speaking of persona, I didn't come into this to end up living a double life. I remain true to myself in my work and social media presence. I'm a very 'what you see is what you get' kind of person and always speak my mind. Some people will like it and approve, obviously others don't. What I won't ever accept is that I have to bow down to an internet mob and change who I am, especially when the furore is based on half-truths and misinformation. The reaction has been massively over the top and it's amusing to me that so many, condemning me for alleged use of violence, would actually threaten me with violence without seeing the hypocrisy of that.\" At present, no official action has been taken either by DreamHack or by the Swedish authorities. I've reached out to DreamHack for comment but not heard back from them at the time of writing. We'll update this story should they respond. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Photo credit: DreamHack/Sebastian Ekman. This weekend is all about <a href=\"http://dreamhack.se/dhw15/\">DreamHack Winter</a>, which is happening right now in J nk ping, Sweden. There's top-quality Dota 2, CS:GO, Hearthstone, and more to be watched: so much that you'll have a hard time keeping track of them. Don't worry, though! Thanks to the magic of 'doing lots of esports in the same building', you can listen to a bit of CS:GO casting while watching Dota. Here's what's happening. Dota 2: ASUS ROG DreamLeague Season 4 Playoffs A spread of international Dota 2 talent compete for a share of $150,000 at DreamHack. Frankfurt Major champions OG are taking part, as are ESL One New York winners Vega Squadron. The majority of this bracket is taking place today, Friday the 27th&mdash;but the lower bracket finals and grand finals are both taking place tomorrow. Play starts at 14:00 CET (13:00 GMT/05:00 PST) and you can watch it all on <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/Dreamleague\">Twitch</a>. It is guaranteed to be very Dota: but will it be as Dota as 2013, when the finals took place during a Darude concert? No. That is impossible. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive: FACEIT 2015 Stage 3 Finals $250,000 on the line in a single day. After Thursday's group stages, four surviving top-flight CS:GO teams will play the semi-finals and finals on Saturday. Between Team SoloMid, Virtus.pro, Fnatic and Ninjas in Pyjamas there's a huge amount of talent on display here. Play starts 14:00 CET (13:00 GMT/05:00 PST) and you'll find the livestream <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.tv/\">here</a> (and also in the background of the Dota stream.) Hearthstone: DreamHack NVidia Grand Prix Running throughout the weekend, this is an open tournament with a $40,000 prize pool. It'll start with a Swiss format (no eliminations, players earn points to determine standing) followed by an elimination bracket. Anybody can enter, but they'll be up against some of the best players in the world&mdash;including Worlds champion Ostkaka. Watch on the <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.tv/hearthstone\">official streaming site</a>. StarCraft II: DreamHack ROCCAT LotV Championship The competitive scene is still developing around the changes brought in by Legacy of the Void, so this tournament is one of your best opportunities to see new strats in action. Rob Zacny wrote&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/what-should-you-expect-from-pro-starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/\">this article</a> earlier in the week about changes you're likely to see, but find out for sure this weekend as a roster of European players (plus invited Korean greats) click on stuff really quickly for $50,000. Play is ongoing, with the remaining matches taking place tomorrow from, you guessed it, 14.00 CET (13.00 GMT/05:00 PST). Once again, the place to be is the <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.tv/starcraft-2\">official streaming site</a>. Ultra Street Fighter IV: Capcom Pro Tour Dreamhack is a premier stop for the Capcom Pro Tour as it continues its journey around the world. A share of $250,000 is on the line, with 32 players in contention from all around the world. A great opportunity to see some top-quality Street Fighter&mdash;and get excited for next year's SF V. Group stage play begins on Saturday at 11:00 CET (10:00 GMT/02:00 PST) and continues until the end of the day. Watch it <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.tv/capcom-pro-tour\">here</a>. League of Legends: 2015 International Wildcard All-Stars Believe it or not, there's something happening this weekend that isn't happening in Sweden. Melbourne, Australia will host LoL's first-ever Wildcard tournament in order to determine which teams represent the Wildcard regions at the All-Star Event in a couple of weeks. The format is pretty unusual: each region's All-Star team is assembled by player vote and play will take place across multiple mode, including standard 5 vs. 5 Summoner's Rift, 1 vs 1, and a player-voted mode. Play started on Thursday and runs through to the end of Saturday. <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames\">Here's the stream</a>. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Inferno can be a tricky map to defend unless you understand it. To that end, start by learning the call-outs &mdash;the names used to describe each part of the map. <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=157442340\">This guide</a> by Froosh and collaborators is a very useful resource to bookmark. Keep the Inferno image open in a tab as you work through the rest of this article. There are two major chokepoints that you want to control: middle and top of banana. If you manage to keep the terrorists from pushing past these points until the end of the round you are likely to have gathered enough information to be ready for the final aggression. At first glance this may seem simple, but if you have played a couple of games on Inferno you know that this isn't the case. One reason for this is the long rotations between the two bomb sites. As a consequence, you will have to slow down the terrorists. Utility Grenades Always prioritize smoke grenade, then two flashbangs. If you have money left you should go for an incendiary unless you plan to go for double grenades in either banana or middle to do some initial damage. Having identified the problem, it's time to defuse it. In order to have a successful CT half you have to make the most of your utility grenades: don't throw away a flashbang for no reason. Bombsite A You want two guys to cover mid. Preferably one on arch side and one truck side. These guys will be your impenetrable wall. They will use their smoke grenades to ensure the terrorists won't be able to take over mid (at least not without begging for mercy when the rotation from B joins the party.) You can use a flashbang to let your teammate peek and maybe even get a kill. If that player finds terrorists about to push mid he mustn't panic. Instead, you should just put down a smoke screen. Generally the player on the arch side should use his smoke first. That way you will still have smokes left on A if the arch player has to rotate to B. The third player on A will make sure your opponents don't take control over apartments. This guy will be the James Bond of your team: the secret agent whose aim is to go for sneaky plays and catch the terrorists off-guard. If you have a smoke up in mid, the truck side player can support him from boiler stairs and let him hide in bedroom. <em>On the next page: control bombsite B, plus when to buy an AWP.</em> Bombsite B On this site I like to have one highly confident player go a little more aggressive and peek angles. The other person gets to be the annoying devil who will make sure the attackers are so flashbanged they couldn't find a crater on the moon. The first player can take a peek from the corner at the top of banana and try to spot terrorists. If they go for a fast push he can call for a smoke from the support player. If, on the other hand, he can hear them further down in banana or just wants to take a more aggressive peek, his ally can either flash over the roof or in front of the car as shown below. If the guys on A need help it's best if the support player rotates if he has used his smoke already. Remember, clever use of utility grenades is what wins you rounds. When the terrorists decide to commit to B they will almost always smoke off CT spawn. By this time it's likely that one of you will find yourself behind the grey cloud of death, but have no fear! Now you have two options. Either that player rotates around the construction site to spools or you can go for the ballsy play and flash pool so that the player from CT side can push the smoke and catch the enemies with their pants down. AWP on Inferno You have won a couple of rounds in a row and you find yourself with an abundance of cash. It's tempting to go back to the hotel and have a drink or two. Maybe buy something nice for you and your friends after a long day of combat. But no, now is not the time. There's still a war to be won. Instead you pick up the AWP. Let's say your AWP player decides to peek banana and he ends up getting a kill. Then he can fall back towards CT spawn, lay down a smoke screen and switch positions with the guy on arch side on A. Often the terrorists will opt out and rotate back to mid, just to find themselves getting killed once again by the same AWPer. Note that this is a risky play and you should only use it once or twice. Mix it up Even though nothing can replace good communication and smart positioning you will have to mix it up a bit every now and then. After all, you don't want your opponents to read you like an open book. This is the time to use the card up your sleeve. This flash from inside the corner on arch side is one of my favorite flashes in the entire game. Simply line up your crosshair with the line on the wall, flash, wait, and pick up some free kills. Another high risk, high reward play is to let your support player hide behind sandbags. Peek banana from your usual corner and when you see a terrorist, just back off, call for a flash and then the two of you can spray them down. Watch your Replays Go to the 'Watch' tab. Then 'Your Matches'. Select the game you want to watch and click 'Download'. That replay will now appear in your 'Downloaded' tab. Click 'Watch on GOTV'. Final words Some of these things are easy to do and will help you win more games, whereas some things will take more time to master. Watch your replays (take a look to the right for instructions) and pay attention to what the enemy team did. Should you have rotated earlier? Later? Just remember, practice makes perfect: if at first you don't succeed, buy a defuse kit and try again. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

This is a young and dynamic competitive scene and a really exciting game to watch: thoroughly recommend checking it out, even if you only tune in for the finals. The show begins at 10.30 EST (15.30 GMT/07:30 PST) on both days, and you ll find the Twitch stream <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/smitegame\">right here</a>. Counter-Strike: GO at Intel Extreme Masters San Jose Seven international invited teams plus one qualifier (from last week s iBUYPOWER Cup) take part in a brutal two-day single-elimination bracket. This promises to be top-flight CS:GO with a healthy prize pool, and a good opportunity for US fans to watch games on their own time for the first time since, er, last week. But it s normally less common, honest. Play begins at 19.40 PST on both days, which is 22.40 EST. This creates a bit of an issue for European viewers: Saturday s games will begin at 03.40 GMT/04.40 CET on Sunday and Sunday s at the same time on Monday. That s only fair, mind.

As Worlds 2015 fades into memory, rekindle your enthusiasm for competitive League this weekend. As with CS:GO, this is a single-elimination bracket: but unlike CS:GO, the teams ere assembled through a vote in China, Europe and North America plus a single invited KeSPA team, Jin Air Green Wings.

        "contents": "Pistol rounds are among the most important rounds in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Winning your pistol rounds gives you an economic advantage that makes it much easier to take the following two rounds as well. In a game where the first team to get to 16 rounds wins, winning four rounds cheaply gives you a huge advantage. It s also important to learn to use pistols so that you can take advantage of an eco round . Your opponent have just won a round and now you re out of money. You can t afford a complete loadout but you don t want to throw a round away. This is the time to buy a pistol, some armor and be the John Wayne you know you can be! Counter Terrorist pistol choices What's 'Aimpunch'? When you get shot without armor, your screen will flick up slightly, making it hard for you to hit your target. Choosing the correct pistol is just as important as knowing how to use it, so let s get started with the buy phase. In the first round of either half you start off with $800. Currently, most professional players choose to use that money to buy kevlar with their default pistol. While I don t think all professional strategies work in matchmaking, this way of starting the CT side is hard to argue with. The accuracy of the USPS-S makes up for the shortage of bullets and having kevlar removes the aimpunch,making it a great pistol setup. If you re using the p2000 instead of the USP-s you ll have enough bullets to keep your enemies at a distance, allowing your team to rotate to your bombsite. Make sure someone in the team buys a defuse kit! Terrorist pistol choices The terrorist side isn t much different than the counter terrorist side when it comes to pistols. Most players will want to simply buy armor and stick with their Glock-18. The Glock is a great weapon to run and gun with which is what you ll be doing a lot of the time as a terrorist. A popular strategy among both professional players and matchmakers is the raid boss setup. One person buys armor while another player provides him or her with a Tec-9. They themselves buy a flash and a smoke, giving the team some utility. This way you end up with 4 armored players, one of which has a very strong pistol. Eco rounds Eco round buys are often decided on the fly but there are some guidelines for you to follow as you decide what to go for. Because communication in matchmaking is often not much better than Twitch chat, your buys can be decided entirely by what the rest of your team is doing. If nobody buys, you re best off following the group and saving for the next round. However, if all the planets do align and you get to buy a pistol, it s up to you not to buy the wrong one. Buying a p250 is a cheap way to get a gun out of your opponent s hands: it s a great pistol for getting quick, close range kills. You can spam it quite rapidly or take your time and go for the single headshot. The Five-Seven is a second option on the CT side that offers you nearly the same pistol with a few more bullets per clip and higher armor penetration. The CZ75-Auto is a good gun for standing around a corner, waiting for someone to walk by and emptying a clip into the back of their head. The pistol is expensive, however, and it lacks bullets.Unless you have the perfect position for it, I would always buy the Five-Seven over the CZ. On the terrorist side, buying the Tec-9 feels like the obvious choice. Being able to empty a 24-bullet clip into your opponent as quickly as the Tec-9 allows can turn a round in your favour. Buying Dual Elites is almost always a mistake, which leaves us with the fan-favorite Desert Eagle. There is no better feeling in CS:GO than shooting someone in the head with a Desert Eagle using only your first shot. Taking out a player who has just invested $6000 in their loadout with a $700 pistol feels like killing an mammoth with a Super Soaker. Using the Desert Eagle is hard so for most players, however, that it s not a worthy investment&mdash;but if you re feeling lucky it won t hurt to try it once in a while. Scoring kills The counter terrorist s USP-s is freakishly accurate and will get you one-shot kills if you hit your helmet-less target in the head. The small clip size forces you to use your bullets carefullyso aim for the head and don t spam too much unless you re in a close range battle. The Glock-18 requires the opposite playstyle. This gun is perfect for running at your target, shouting obscenities and spamming your left mouse button. Only put the gun on burst mode (right click) if you re going to attempt jump shooting and keep your crosshair on your opponent s head at all times, only correcting for recoil. What's a 'CHOKE'? A choke is a hallway, tunnel, set of doors or otherwise narrow location that makes it hard for multiple people to walk through at the same time. The p250 and the Five-Seven are played nearly identically. Because both these pistols can get one-shot headshot kills on close range&mdash;even against opponents with kevlar and a helmet -it s a good idea to try to put yourself in 1v1 positions. You do this by standing around the corner from a choke location and aiming at head height. What's a 'Recoil Pattern'? Every gun has its own recoil pattern. After firing your first bullet, your next bullet won t land on the exact same spot. The pattern of where your bullets land on a full spray is what we call a recoil pattern. The terrorists s Tec-9 is a strong pistol for running and gunning . This gun s recoil pattern&nbsp;is about as random as a best of one group stage so the best way to use the Tec-9 is by spamming it whenever you get close enough for your bullets to actually hit your target. When you do get close enough you have a very good chance of killing your opponent, regardless of which weapon they re using. The Desert Eagle is less like a pistol and more like a tiny AWP. Wildly inaccurate when you re moving, the Deagle requires you to come to a complete stop before firing off bullets that will instantly kill a helmeted player with a headshot, even from a long distance. For short range kills you can spam your deagle but the more time you give the pistol to reset to its default position, the more accurate your shots will be. Improving quickly You don t get to play too many pistol rounds during a competitive CS:GO game so jumping into a pistol-only deathmatch server is a great way to improve your pistol play. Try only using the USP-s and aiming for the head and you ll feel yourself get better every time you play. A good pistol player can hand their team two of the most important rounds of the game. A great pistol player can turn an entire game around and create some of the most beautiful moments we ve seen in Counter-Strike history: <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

This Halloween weekend is stuffed fuller than a trick or treater s cheap plastic candy basket with professional gaming action. Unlike a Jack O Lantern full of off-brand Mars bars, this week s matches are guaranteed to get you hyped without the associated sugar crash afterwards. It is unknown which of these two options is better for your teeth, though. It s the season finale of League of Legends and Counter-Strike s yearly dramas, as well as some prep work for Blizzard s festival of electronic sport next week. There is literally something for everyone, so get a pail of candied corn in and celebrate death (or whatever Halloween is about) with some fine esportsmanship. League of Legends Worlds 2015 Finals Worlds comes to a creepy close this All Hallows Eve, as finalists SK Telecom T1 take on their surprise contenders KOO Tigers in Berlin. Though not the all-Europe final many were hoping for after the elimination of both Fnatic and Origen in last week s semifinal bouts, this still promises to be a thrilling conclusion to the LoL year. KOO, the Korean rejects , will be looking to prove their fellow countrymen wrong to pass over them when putting together this year s rosters. SKT, however, fill the role of the infallible professionals with Faker the final raid boss before KOO can lift the Summoner s Cup. It all ends Saturday at 04:00 PDT / 11:00 GMT and you can catch it on the official Riot Games <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames\">Twitch</a> or Azubu. Counter-Strike: DreamHack Cluj-Napoca Throughout this weekend, the world s best CS:GO teams will be fighting their way through the final Major of the year, and the last chance to bag glory in 2015. Things are already looking a bit shaken up for this one as Luminosity Gaming have gotten out of their group and into the playoffs ahead of the year s reigning champs, Fnatic. The ESL Cologne winners now have one more match on Friday 02:00 PDT/09:00 GMT against the massively improved US Cloud9 side to determine if they continue on with a chance to defend their title. After that, the quarters play out on Saturday, starting 02:00 PDT/09:00 GMT and the last at 11:00 PDT/18:00 GMT. Then Sunday concludes with the semis from 02:00 PST/10:00 GMT and the final at 09:00 PST/17:00 GMT, all streamed via DreamHack s <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhackcs\">Twitch channel</a>. Dota 2: Nanyang Championship 2015 The conclusion of this month s Nanyang Championship plays out over Friday and Sunday this weekend, with Team Secret already overcoming a shaky start to the new season and finding themselves in the final. Friday s losers bracket playoffs will decide who faces them in that final (Sunday 01:00 PST/09:00 GMT&mdash;watch that daylight savings change, America) and Vici Gaming, Team Liquid and EHOME are all still in the running to do so. You can catch all of those on the <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit\">BTS twitch</a>. Hearthstone World Championships group stages BlizzCon proper isn t until next weekend, but there are quite a few matches to get out of the way before those grand finals. For Hearthstone, the groups have already begun and will continue until Saturday as players bid to secure their spot on stage for the quarterfinals on November 6. Some standout matches include ThijsNL vs Kno (Friday 09:00 PDT/16:00 GMT), the Japanese contender who finds himself second in Group A after edging out JAB 3-2 in his first match. The top two battles continue with Kranich vs Zoro at 10:00 PDT/17:00GMT and Ostkaka and Hotform face off just after at 11:00 PDT/18:00 GMT. Chinese and Taiwanese competitors Zihao and Pinpingho round out the battle for the top of their groups at 12:00 PDT/19:00 GMT. You can catch all matches on Friday and Saturday on Blizzard s <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/playhearthstone\">official stream</a>. StarCraft: WCS Global Finals 2015 Also on the BlizzCon prep list is the StarCraft Round of 16. These start on Sunday, with the top-vs-bottom matchup of herO vs FanTaSy (10:00 PST/18:00 GMT) and continue down the WCS rankings, pitting the top players against their inverse rank qualifiers every 90 minutes or so.

        "contents": "Following&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dreamhack-open-cluj-napoca/\">three earlier parts in this series</a>, we have finally gotten to the four best teams in the world who are most likely going to be competing for the title of world champions at DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca, which had its first group matches today&nbsp;(here's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://open.dreamhack.se/news/295-schedule-and-format-for-the-next-csgo-major.html\" target=\"_blank\">the schedule</a>). Three of these teams are old champions&mdash;though EnVyUs s win featured two different players&mdash;while TSM are still hoping to score their first elusive major championship. Let s take a look at the four biggest favorites, in no particular order. fnatic&nbsp; <strong>Sweden</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;flusha, JW, KRiMZ, olofm, pronax fnatic are the defending champions, having won the last two majors at ESL One Cologne and ESL One Katowice. However, in the past couple of months their level of play has seemingly decreased, with losses piling up against all of the teams they will be competing with for the title. The competition is only going to get tougher, and sometimes what you need to get a boost of motivation is to lose a couple of times, in order to want to put in work again. It is surprisingly easy to get complacent when you are at the top, and if fnatic end up winning their third straight major title, they will be the first ones to tell you it was key to lose some tournaments leading up to it. In Cologne, fnatic was the&nbsp;clear favorite going in. This time it should be a much closer affair. Any of the three other teams here&mdash;TSM, Virtus.pro, or EnVyUs&mdash;could realistically take down pronax s squad in a best-of-three series. In a vacuum I would still pick fnatic as the likeliest champions, but the world is not a vacuum&mdash;and things like motivation matter. I do not think fnatic will lose to Virtus.pro or EnVyUs, but if they face TSM earlier than the grand final, it is possible that the Black and Orange may miss on a three-peat. On the other hand, if they get to grand final and someone else has already knocked TSM out, they could complete a three-peat, which no one will, most likely, ever repeat in CS:GO. Talk about a legendary team. Team SoloMid <strong>Denmark</strong> &mdash; cajunb, device, dupreeh, karrigan, Xyp9x) TSM is obviously going to be competing for the title at Cluj-Napoca.&nbsp;The team has an incredible record in Romania&mdash;not that it really matters&mdash;and has been trending up in recent months. They still seem to have fnatic in their back pocket, but their kryptonite is EnVyUs, and their record versus Virtus.pro is not much better either. As a result, device s and Team SoloMid s final placing at the next major, if they do not significantly improve on their game, will likely depend heavily on the bracket draw. In simplest terms, you would pick TSM as a slight favorite versus fnatic, an underdog versus EnVyUs, and a 50-50 shot against Virtus.pro. That is a great situation to be in, considering those are your main competition for the title, but at the same time it still shows how much this major s title is up for grabs. If the trio of device, dupreeh and cajunb play like stars, karrigan has the occasional impact round he s had recently and calls well, and Xyp9x continues clutching big rounds, I could easily see this being TSM s event. And when you think about what each team has going for them motivation-wise, I think that only makes sense. My money is on TSM at this coming major. EnVyUs&nbsp; <strong>France</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;apEX, Happy, kennyS, kioShiMa, NBK EnVyUs won their first tournament with the new roster&mdash;IEM Gamescom&mdash;with four map wins over TSM. They placed second, only to fnatic, at ESL One Cologne, and aside from the sloppy play at ESL ESEA Dubai Invitational, have mostly looked like the kind of team who might make another grand final run at Cluj-Napoca. I still believe this may be the most skilled roster ever assembled, and while Happy s playing style comes under scrutiny at times, there s no denying his system works, and that he is the most skilled in-game leader in the game. The ceiling of EnVyUs, when firing on all cylinders, is incredibly high. That is the number one thing they have going for them with the amount of skill this roster packs. On the other hand, kennyS has not been the force we became used to since the AWP update, apEX remains very up and down, and while both kioShiMa and NBK are star lever players at times, both also have the occasional bad series. This team s problem is that they do not have a single go-to guy who is able to win them terrorist rounds when needed&mdash;which has a lot to do with the fact their lurker is their in-game leader. It has not been much of a problem in the past, but I would bet that a team doing their homework would have it the easiest versus EnVyUs out of these four teams. If they are on fire, they can win it all, and the trio of Happy, kioShiMa, and NBK can secure their second major, a year removed from the first one. But if multiple players have a bad series at the wrong time, these guys could exit in the semis, or even in the quarter-finals. Virtus.pro <strong>Poland</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;byali, NEO, pasha, Snax, TaZ Virtus.pro is the ultimate underdog team. Their form comes and goes, and while Snax is the team s best player over the long haul, any one of their five players is capable of being the best player in any series. Out of these four squads, it s possible that Virtus.pro match-up the best against the others overall. After the win over fnatic at the&nbsp;PGL Season 1 Finals they overcame the mental block of dropping the ESL One Cologne semi-final, and should feel very confident going into this event. It is a clich at this point to say the Poles play better at the majors, but it still holds true&mdash;and there is little reason to expect that to change. If pasha is able to step up his game and become the kind of force he was in early 2014&mdash;when he was briefly considered a top five player in the world&mdash;this team could become world number one. Without him putting up huge numbers, there is not enough consistent firepower. TaZ and NEO still come and go, though the latter has improved a ton in recent months, and byali s ups and downs are legendary at this point. Snax contributes constantly, but one player is not enough to overcome the likes of fnatic, TSM, or EnVyUs. I expect Virtus.pro to make the semi-finals, and it would not be at all surprising to see them in the grand final. But that will depend on what kind of performance kuben is able to draw from his players over a five day period. <em>You can reach <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lurppis_\">@lurppis_ on Twitter</a>.</em> <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "In the third part of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://open.dreamhack.se/\" target=\"_blank\">DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca</a> preview series (here are parts&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-dark-horses-of-csgos-next-major-tournament/\">one</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-underdogs-of-csgos-next-major-tournament/\">two</a>), we finally take a look at teams who are expected to still be competing in the $250,000 tournament when it reaches the playoff stage. These four teams are, by odds, expected to go out in the quarter-finals&mdash;or, in other words, there are four teams at the event who are expected to do even better. We'll go over them tomorrow, but from here on out, anyone could win if things break out right. Gamers2 <strong>Europe</strong> dennis, fox, jkaem, Maikelele, rain Much like for NiP, for Gamers2, at least in its current formation, this major will effectively be its last hurrah. We do not know how these two rosters will look in January, but it is a given at this point that some of those rumors will come true. Kinguin defeated Cloud9 after a Tec-9 round win at 13-14 at ESL One Cologne, giving them a spot here. They added jkaem&mdash;who impressed at the DH Cluj-Napoca qualifier&mdash;to replace ScreaM, who was reportedly bought out for 150,000 to join Titan during the period in-between the majors. This team has a lot of skill, but that will only get you so far. With four players speaking Swedish to some degree, fox is obviously the odd man out. In fact, getting your average, pretty good Swedish player likely would improve this team. However, since the team s days are numbered to begin with, there is probably no point in making changes anymore. I think the skill of this team will get them through the lower tier teams, but at the same time it would not be at all surprising if a team like Cloud9 or Titan knocked them out. They simply have the higher seed to guard them from having a tough group. I m willing to side with G2 and assume they have what it takes to make the playoffs, but there is no faith in them making the semi-finals. NiP <strong>Sweden</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;allu, f0rest, friberg, GeT_RiGhT, Xizt The NiP farewell tour has been mostly a success&mdash;their run at ESL ESEA Dubai Invitational was their best result in who knows how long, and they have had some decent results online as well. This team will not yield this roster come January 1, but we still have some two months left where the legendary NiP core will, together with allu, try to add an international title to their resume. And, interestingly enough, in my opinion this team is now more dangerous than it has ever been, save for the first two months or so after allu joined the team in late February. Everyone on this team is now, to some degree, playing for themselves. This team is not staying together, so while winning would be great, what these players care about, or should care about, is how they portray themselves going into 2016&mdash;as that will largely decide their future. GeT_RiGhT will have takers no matter what, but what are allu or friberg going to do if they have poor showings? Those players must play well in the last months they have with NiP, which is exactly why I believe this team will be dangerous. Xizt s calling and leadership will never win them games, let alone events, but the individual skill of these five players combined? It s possible. Expect NiP to cruise through to the playoffs, and honestly, I would not be at all surprised if they made the semis. Titan&nbsp; <strong>France</strong> &nbsp;Ex6TenZ, RpK, ScreaM, SmithZz, shox Titan are an odd bunch. The addition of ScreaM definitely added considerably skill they did not have with Maniac on the team, but at the same time they still have three players who are not ever going to blow up the bank with their individual efforts. RpK s comeback has been disappointing, SmithZz is not a top tier player, and while Ex6TenZ does his job when it comes to leadership, he has never been much of a contributor on an individual basis. That leaves an awful lot of pressure on shox and ScreaM to bring it day in and day out, but that duo just might be able to do it. While Ex6TenZ s teams have not made it out of the group stage at a major in what feels like forever&mdash;nearly two years by the time this event kicks off&mdash;they are still a dangerous group to go up against simply because of the Belgian s leadership and tactics. They often cause issues for the very top teams in the world, and the addition of ScreaM should be enough to put them over the top against lower level of competition skill-wise. I think Titan will finally get out of the groups and, if shox is as motivated as I assume him to be, could even scare a team in the quarter-finals. This team makes sense on paper, and it seems they are much more motivated than one would have assumed after the former EnVyUs duo s ugly exit from the team that led to them joining Titan in July. Na`Vi&nbsp; <strong>Ukraine</strong> &nbsp;Edward, flamie, GuardiaN, seized, Zeus Natus Vincere s future largely depends on how the ex-CIS powerhouse does at Cluj-Napoca. The leaked screenshot of GuardiaN s chat with STYKO revealed that the team was close to replacing both Edward and Zeus. That never wound up going through, and now STYKO is playing for HellRaisers as a stand-in, but that may be temporary. Rumors say Na`Vi s future will be decided after this event, so an exit in the group stage or even where I am assuming they will go out&mdash;in the quarter-finals&mdash;will likely mean this team will not look the same in 2016. Na`Vi have had a strong year overall, being ranked in the top two at their peak. However, they have had multiple instances where seemingly they allowed constant bickering and complaining get to them&mdash;an issue that existed in Zeus s Na`Vi teams going as far back as at least 2011&mdash;and it seems they are not going to be able to fix those issues. Instead of Zeus leading, the task will be on their coach and former member starix, which could help alleviate some issues in-game, but the issues of whining and not playing as a team are likely too prevalent to fix. Those rumors have existed about Edward for a&nbsp;year, and it s hard to see them being fixed for good. Expect Na`Vi to be good, but not great. Base case is quarter-finals exit, and if things go well, they could reach the semis. <em>You can reach <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lurppis_\">@lurppis_ on Twitter</a>.</em> <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "A&nbsp;brief lull descends over the esports scene this weekend in the calm before next week s storm. The LoL Worlds finals, Dota 2 Frankfurt Major, BlizzCon and CS:GO s last Major of the year at DreamHack Cluj-Napoca all loom close on the horizon, so it seems only right to get some respite before then. Despite there being no trophies to hand out this weekend, there are still plenty of top flight games to tune into as both the CS:GO ESL ESEA Pro League and Dota DreamLeague seasons continue their early group round robin stages. And let s not forget the penultimate stage of Worlds as the European road trip to the Summoner s Cup draws to a close. Here are the biggest esports fixtures of the weekend. League of Legends Worlds 2015 Semifinals Having shed all but four teams from their tour around Europe, the Riot banterbus rolls into Brussels this weekend for the semifinals. It s a very EU affair, too, as Origen and Fnatic have made it through the gauntlet on opposite sides of the bracket, meaning a home continent derby finals is still on the cards. For that to happen, however, Origen would have to best SKT Telecom T1 who have been on striking form this season. And Fnatic will need to send home KOO Tigers, who staged a surprise coup against their Korean rivals KT Rolster who swiped the second seed spot from them in the playoffs. The quarters at Wembley were a bit of a whitewash, with three of four matches resulting in one-sided sweeps, but the talent seems closer in these matchups. Find out when Origen face SKT on Saturday at 07:30 PDT/15:30 BST, and KOO take on Fnatic Sunday at the earlier time of 05:30 PDT/12:30 GMT (watch out for that British daylight savings change, folks). You can catch it all on the official&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames\">Riot Games Twitch</a> or Azubu. Counter-Strike: ESL ESEA Pro League Season 2 In the interim before Cluj-Napoca, you can catch HellRaisers, Titan, Ninjas in Pyjamas, TSM, Virtus.pro and EnVyUs in some regular season matches. This weekend s specific matchups in the round robin pit all of the North American teams against one another over the course of two days. Starting from 15:00 PDT/23:00 BST until 20:00 PDT/03:00 GMT on Saturday night Cloud9, CLG, Team Liquid, EnemyGG and Coastless will face off against one another before repeating the matchups again on the Sunday. The rest of the European action takes course earlier each day, from 08:00 PDT/16:00 BST on the Saturday and 08:00 PDT/15:00 GMT on the Sunday. You can catch those on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo\">ESL s Twitch channel</a>.&nbsp; Dota 2: DreamLeague Season 4 Another run-of-the-mill round robin bracket continues this weekend to determine who will get a crack at the $150,000 prize pool at November s DreamHack Winter finals. Though the Frankfurt Major is around the same time, many of the invited and qualified teams are competing which has led to some clenchworthy finishes in recent games. Don t be surprised to see scenes reminiscent of Alliance battling back against megacreeps to defeat NiP&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Hh3BXwgBw\">during the Major qualifiers</a>. Matches begin at 04:30 PDT/12:30 BST on Saturday with 4CL versus Monkey Freedom Fighters and finish at 12:00 PDT/20:00 BST with MFF facing off against NiP. Catch the action on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/dreamleague\">DreamLeague Twitch channel</a>. Dota 2: The Summit 4 American Qualifiers Sunday s Dota fix comes in the form of The Summit 4 s American qualifiers, also Saturday s, if you want to catch the winner s bracket final of ROOT Gaming play Digital Chaos at 14:00 PDT/22:00 BST (which, of course, you do). Sunday s matches represent the final chances in the loser s bracket (14:00 PDT/21:00 BST) for Cloud9 and whoever survives today s game between paiN Gaming and Elite Wolves. And after that, at 17:00 PDT/midnight GMT, Wizards &amp; Priests will take on the victor s of today s compLexity versus Team Archon showdown.

        "contents": "In the second part of our four-part&nbsp;<a href=\"http://open.dreamhack.se/page/clujnapoca/\" target=\"_blank\">DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca</a> preview, we take a look at four more hopefuls who are not favored, but unlike&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-dark-horses-of-csgos-next-major-tournament/\">the earlier bunch</a>, could realistically all make it to the playoffs. Here comes the next tier of competition at the $250,000 major. Luminosity <strong>Brazil</strong> &nbsp;boltz, coldzera, FalleN, fer, steel The Brazilians had a solid showing at ESL One Cologne, scoring their second consecutive top eight finish at a major. In the group stage they bested Kinguin, and after multiple overtimes, FlipSid3, before ultimately being knocked out of the event by fnatic in the quarter-finals. Luminosity has a strategic approach to the game, and that combined with the fact Europeans don t see them play too often and them now getting quality practice in North America helps their game tremendously. In the right group Luminosity could have a very good shot at advancing&mdash;think having the likes of Gamers2 or Titan in theirs&mdash;but unfortunately a lot of it will come down to luck. What they do have going for them is the legend-seed, due to their top eight finish in Germany. FalleN s troops will be hoping for another top eight finish, one that would definitely solidify them as a top eight team in the world despite being fairly inactive as a team outside of the majors. mousesports <strong>Europe</strong> &nbsp;chrisJ, denis, gob b, nex, NiKo I d been saying for months that NiKo would replace either Spiidi or denis in mousesports after the major, and that their ceiling would, as a result of getting the highly skilled Bosnian rifler onboard, increase. However, so far it seems that the fragging load has simply moved towards NiKo, while nex has seemed to struggle individually after the change. Obviously some spots and roles had to be shuffled around, but if mouz want to compete for a playoff spot, they need nex to get back to the level of play he showcased during the late spring and throughout the summer. chrisJ has finally started playing like a top level AWPer should, more consistently. He has a very explosive playing style that can win rounds for mousesports at any point&mdash;not unlike NiKo s, though the latter is far more consistent. If nex can step up his game and gob b comes into Cluj-Napoca sleeves filled with new tricks, I would not be at all surprised to see mousesports continue through to the playoffs. However, at this point based on what we have seen, it is more likely that they will once again fall short. And if they do, I m not sure this team can continue as it is. Cloud9&nbsp; <strong>USA</strong> &nbsp;fREAKAZOiD, n0thing, sg@res, shroud, Skadoodle Every North American s favorite team has officially started struggling badly right after the incredible streak of top two finishes in July ended. Following second place finishes at ESL ESEA Pro League Season 1 Finals, ESWC and FACEIT Stage 2 Finals, they first went out in the&nbsp;semi-finals at the&nbsp;CEVO Professional Season 7 Finals, then crashed out in groups at ESL One Cologne against what should have been an inferior Kinguin team, and then went out in last place at the&nbsp;ESL ESEA Dubai Invitational. In other words, the magic, if there was any, is far removed from this team. Skadoodle is the team s star and will always put up the necessary numbers for Cloud9 to have a chance. The issue, therefore, lies elsewhere. Shroud is still incredibly inconsistent and until he figures out how to show up more often, must be considered one of the most overrated players by today s fans. Sure, in Cologne in July he had an incredible showing, especially in the grand final versus fnatic, but it s been nearly four months since then. Sg@res will have to make all the right calls, while fREAKAZOiD and n0thing will need to put up impact rounds. There are a lot of question marks here, which is why I do not expect Cloud9 to advance from its group. dignitas&nbsp; <strong>Denmark </strong>&mdash;&nbsp;aizy, Kjaerbye, MSL, Pimp, schneider Dignitas looked promising throughout the summer with Nico on the roster, though there were probably a grand total of zero people who expected that to last, even if the final blow was not his choice this time around. On paper schneider seems like a strong pickup, a former fnatic player who has won the first major ever held for the game. However, it is unclear how effectively he can communicate with the rest of the team due to only speaking Swedish, and this team actually seemed to be quite reliant on their tactics. Besides, Pimp moving to an AWPer role has not worked out whatsoever. There is potential here for sure. Kjaerbye will someday put it all together&mdash;remember he is still incredibly young at just 17 years old&mdash;and he can become a fourth wheel if this roster sticks together. They have four capable fraggers as it is, and MSL has proven to be a decent leader in this situation. This team will figure all their issues out sometime in the next twelve months, most likely, and start competing for semi-final spots. In the past they would have become a farm team&mdash;someone the top tier teams poach players from&mdash;but stronger contracts have changed all that. Expect dignitas to go out in the groups, but not without a fight. <em>You can reach&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lurppis_\" target=\"_blank\">@lurppis_</a></em><em>&nbsp;on Twitter.</em> Update: After this article was written,&nbsp;dignitas removed schneider and added tenzki as a stand-in. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "In the first part of this four-part preview for the next Counter-Strike: Global Offensive major,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://open.dreamhack.se/page/clujnapoca/\">DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca</a> held from October 28 to November 1 in Romania, we take a look at the four participants who are the <em>least</em> likely to be competing for the $100,000 first place prize on the fifth and final day of the tournament. In the time&nbsp;leading up to the event we ll cover the other 12 teams competing for the title, but now, let s take a look at the first four teams, in no particular order, who will be traveling to Romania for the next $250,000 major. These are all great&nbsp;teams, but they ll be dark horses at Cluj-Napoca. Vexed <strong>Poland</strong> &mdash; Furlan, GruBy, Hyper, peet, rallen Locals expected these guys to do well at ESL One Cologne after they took down the days old Titan line-up at the qualifier, but naturally the Poles were quickly eliminated by stronger competition&mdash;namely fnatic and CLG. At this event s qualifier, GruBy s team lost to HellRaisers in the opening round, but bounced back with a win over Skyred, and the same HellRaisers squad, to book them their second consecutive major event appearance. Now that they have already been to a major, this team must be hungrier than before. It is likely they will not be happy with going out 0-2 this time around, yet it s most likely that will still be their destiny. However, they took down Titan and HellRaisers before, both clear upsets versus teams not many thought they stood a chance against. They could once again score an upset at DreamHack, and even if they do not progress from the groups, as is expected, it can still be a positive learning experience. FlipSid3 <strong>Ukraine</strong> &mdash; B1ade, bondik, DavCost, markeloff, WorldEdit FlipSid3 have continued playing well since s1mple s departure in July&mdash;in fact, I would bet that not many people that are unaffiliated with the team expected them to continue putting in good results. The Ukrainian team was already low on individual skill and high on tactics and teamplay, so losing one of the world s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-csgo-players-in-the-world/\">most skilled</a> players and your most skilled player certainly did not help. Yet here they are, markeloff heading to yet another major, and again hoping to be the cinderella story of the event. FlipSid3 will most likely finish either third of fourth in their group. They possess enough potential to even make it through to the playoffs if placed in a favorable group that breaks out just the right way, but realistically the depth in teams is probably too much for this team in Cluj-Napoca. In a sense, they remain gatekeepers newcomers in Europe must get through to break into the top sixteen of the world&mdash;a ranking that does not sound like much, but entitles you to a healthy salary, and a chance for glory at all the majors. <em>Image courtesy </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eslphotos\"><em>ESL&nbsp;Flickr</em></a> CLG <strong>USA</strong> &mdash; jdm646, FNS, hazed, reltuC, tarik CLG have shown promise here and there, though to this day their greatest achievement was probably the upset win over fnatic on de_mirage at ESL ESEA Pro League Season 1 Finals in early July. The fact is this team simply lacks the ability to close games out, and that has a lot to do with individual skill. While the duo of jdm64 and tarik have shown they are capable of putting up numbers and competing with the best of them, the rest of the team just does not show up often enough. For some reason FNS gave up the calling duties months ago to reltuC, but he has not picked up on fragging one bit since then. Meanwhile reltuC has never been an impact player, and while hazed has the occasional good game, he is not going to put them over the top in a best-of-three series versus an elite team. This team could do with some coaching, but more than anything, they need consistent star level play from tarik, and one other player to step up to the plate. I don t expect that to happen, so they will probably go out in the groups, once again having been close to advancing. <em>Image courtesy&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/14550-team-liquid-enlists-elige\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> Team Liquid <strong>USA</strong> &mdash; adreN, EliGE, FugLy, Hiko, nitr0 EliGE has finally started stepping up his game, and Hiko is a real asset to any team in the world. Even nitr0 has the occasional good game. When looking from afar it seems that this team should have plenty of potential, yet we all know from over three years of CS:GO that adreN has never made any team go anywhere since switching over from Counter-Strike: Source. He hasn t been much of a player in this version of the game, but as one of the few in-game leaders in North America, still continues on one of the region s best teams. In my mind, what Liquid must going against them is how happy they looked after qualifying for the major&mdash;it s one of those cases where you could tell from their players faces, if you were watching, that this was it. There was no hunger left in their faces, aside from Hiko s. They will get bounced early on if they don t luck out, and next time they will want more. This team will gradually improve and may ultimately become a real contender for the top spot in North America, but for the time being they will have to be content with just getting to take in the atmosphere at the major. The next part of this four-part series will feature four more teams that I expect to head out early from DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca. After that, we ll get to the eight teams who will have the best shot at a spot in the semi-finals and ultimately, the next major title. <em>You can reach <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lurppis_\">@lurppis_ on Twitter</a></em><em>.</em> <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

League of Legends ongoing group stages heat up in Paris; Blizzcon gets its latest pair of Hearthstone competitors; the Dota 2 Frankfurt Major begins its massive international qualifier process; the Smite Pro League rumbles on. Fancy something different? Try the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive World Championships 2015, a rare example of a competition featuring national teams rather than established orgs. League of Legends: LCS Worlds Group Stages This has been arguably the most dramatic group stage in the history of the League of Legends World Championship. The action continues this weekend, with matches between Team SoloMid, Origen, KT Rolster, LGD Gaming, Invictus Gaming, ahq e-Sports Club, Fnatic, and Cloud 9. Games run from approximately 10:00 BST/02:00 PDT on Saturday and from 08:00 BST/00:00 PDT on Sunday. Find a full schedule <a href=\"http://worlds.lolesports.com/en_US/worlds/schedule/round_robin/paris-day-7\">right here</a>, and follow the action on the <a href=\"http://watch.euw.lolesports.com/en_GB#/livestream\">official livestream</a>. Need to catch up on the teams? Check out our massive&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/lol-2015-world-championship-get-ready-for-the-group-stage/\">group stage preview</a>. 2015 Hearthstone Americas Championship Hot on the heels of last week's European Road to Blizzcon, the best Hearthstone players in the Americas head to San Francisco to compete for a prize pool of $25,000 and one of two spots at the World Championship at Blizzcon. Play is scheduled to occur all day on Pacific time, and you can follow it all on the <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/playhearthstone\">official stream</a>. Dota 2: The Frankfurt Major 2015 Regional Qualifiers The first Dota 2 Major will find its final set of teams this weekend as all four regional qualifiers happen at once. This includes teams that qualified through the open qualifiers, which have been running all week. There are big names mixed in with the newcomers - Invictus Gaming in China, Na'Vi, Alliance and Ninjas in Pyjamas in Europe, Fnatic and MVP Phoenix in South East Asia. It'll be difficult to follow the entire thing, so I recommend picking a region and sticking with it. Play starts on Saturday at the following times: * USA: 18:00 BST/10:00 PDT. * South East Asia: 03:00 BST/19:00 PDT (Friday night in the USA.); * Europe: 11:00 BST/03:00 PDT. In China, the games start on Sunday at 03:00 BST/19:00 PDT (Friday night in the USA.) Games can be spectated in the client, or check the <a href=\"http://www.thefrankfurtmajor.com/\">official site</a> for Stream info. Counter-Strike: The World Championships 2015 They may well have called this 'Technically The World Championships 2015'. TWC is one of the few esports events to involve national teams rather than sponsored squads. As such, it's a bit of a novelty: a chance to see the USA face off against Singapore, Kyrgyzstan, Sweden and so on. Most players are drawn from multiple esports orgs, with a bunch of free agents in the mix to round things out. The winner takes home $50,000. The group stages are happening right now, with the main bracket to be played over the course of the weekend. Scheduling info isn't currently available that far ahead on the <a href=\"http://twc.e-frag.net/coverage/the-world-championships-2015\">official site</a>, but you can watch the stream <a href=\"http://twc.e-frag.net/streams/efragtv\">here</a> when the time comes. Smite: SPL Fall Split Week 8 Smite's Super Regional draws closer as the Fall Split marches on. Play starts at 18:00 BST/10:00 PDT on both Saturday and Sunday, and all of the games will be streamed on the <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/smitegame\">official Smite Twitch</a> and available afterwards on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDBofwsppusJeitUyKpkB5g\">YouTube</a>. Look out for Cloud9 vs. COG on Sunday. C9 is made up of the players who won the first Smite World Championship under the COG Gaming label earlier in the year: they face off against the team brought in to replace them. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Esports goes full throttle this weekend as the month-long climax of League of Legends begins in Paris. The group stages of LoL's European tour takes place over the next two weeks, the first of four stops that also includes London, Brussels and eventually Berlin for that spooky Hallowe'en Grand Final. In fact, almost&nbsp;every major esport has a top tier showdown this weekend, and with BlizzCon's European qualifiers in the mix, more than half are only the build up to massive global championships at the end of October. It's a busy month, so let's get started right with some sincere GLHFs for the following tournaments. ESL One New York 2015 The first chance to see many of the world's tier 1 teams meeting outside of their own regions since The International. A lot has changed since then, with team rosters frantically scrambled about before September's lock-in date to be eligible for Valve's new Majors format of quarterly tournaments. Quarter-finals begin with Secret's almost unrecognisable new team (save for the remaining Clement 'Puppey' Ivanov) taking on Fnatic at 08:00 PDT/16:00 BST on Saturday, with Evil Geniuses going against Vega Squadron at 17:00 PDT/01:00 BST. Semi-finals begin on Sunday at 08:00 PDT/16:00 BST and the Grand Final Bo5 kicks off at 14:00 PDT/00:00 BST. You can watch it all on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_dota2\" target=\"_blank\">ESL's official Twitch channel</a>.&nbsp; Hearthstone: EU Road 2 BlizzCon HWC 2015 Europe's top card slingers meet in Prague this weekend for the final stage of qualifiers for this month's BlizzCon World Championships. Group stages run Saturday between 03:00-14:40 PDT/11:00-22:40 BST and you'll want to keep your eyes on pretty much any matches coming out of Group A. Maverick, Ostkaka, ThijsNL and Hoej are all excellent and highly entertaining duelists and will ensure some exciting matches before the semi-finals on Saturday evening and final playoffs on the Sunday. You can watch it all on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/playhearthstone\" target=\"_blank\">Blizzard's official Hearthstone stream</a>. Heroes of the Storm: EU Road 2 BlizzCon HWC 2015 Ever the shrewd business people, Blizzard are also holding the Heroes of the Storm EU Championships-cum-BlizzCon Qualifiers at the same time in Prague this weekend. They've even given them the same acronym to save on letters, how thoughtful. It's the final hurdle for European teams before all of the world's best meet in Anaheim at the end of this month, so there's some guaranteed fireworks. Heroes action begins earlier than the rest of Blizzard's stable as the group stages started this morning and are running up until 11:00 PDT/19:00 BST today. Semi-finals begin at 08:00 PDT/16:00 BST on the Saturday, with the second three hours later at 12:30 PDT/19:30 BST. The finals fall to the Sunday at 07:00 PDT/15:00 BST, joining Hearthstone and WoW finals in one glorious Blizzard blowout. You can see all Heroes matches on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/BlizzHeroes\" target=\"_blank\">Blizzard's official stream</a>. League of Legends: LCS Worlds Group Stages The European tour of this year's final showdown for League's top teams kicks off in Paris this extended weekend, beginning Thursday. The group stages are split over this week and the next, in a double round robin format, so there's plenty of chance to see a specific match-up. The seeding system means there'll be no clashes of each regions top talent just yet, but the skill level of all the qualifiers is so high that there's still plenty to tune in for. This weekend's offerings include Origen vs TSM (08:00 PDT/16:00 BST) and iG vs Cloud9 an hour later on the Saturday. Sunday provides a chance to see TSM take on Chinese first seed LGD (05:00 PDT/13:00 BST) and C9 take on EU first seed Fnatic (08:00 PDT/16:00 BST) in day of the American underdogs. All available on pretty much every streaming solution known to man,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames\" target=\"_blank\">including Twitch</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LoLChampSeries\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;and Azubu (and six other Chinese ones if you're feeling exotic). CS:GO: PGL Season 1 Finals Twelve teams whittled down to just four, including Fnatic, TSM, Team Liquid and Virtus.pro, will fight it out for the PGL Championship title starting today with VP vs Liquid and Fnatic vs TSM. Today's semi-finals decide who will be playing for survival on Saturday and who for their spot in Sunday's Grand Finals. The loser's bracket elimination kicks off early on Saturday at 12:00 BST, while the winner's final runs three hours later 15:00 BST. Sunday follows the same schedule with the last chance of making it into the top two for a shot at the $40,000 grand prize coming before the Grand Final at 15:00 BST.

Since ending his playing career in 2012 he has stayed active in the CS:GO scene as part of the media.</em> The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak. There s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world&nbsp;you need clear,&nbsp;specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events&mdash;no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players current form. Before we dig in, let s first take a look at some of the big names who barely missed the cut of being in the top ten. Recent fan favorite Nikola NiKo Kovac did not make this list because he has not performed at enough events yet. Richard shox Papillon came close, and in Titan he might regain the kind of role that will allow him a spot on the list, but currently he must be left out. Finally, NiP s Christopher GeT_RiGhT Alesund s Dubai performance was incredible, but it is not enough after six-plus months of, for him, average play. You could also have made a case for Rene cajunb Borg, who has been TSM s second best player for a long time, and like shox and GeT_RiGhT, boast a strong individual track record at the majors. <em>Photo via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eslphotos/\">ESL Flickr</a> page</em> 10. Kenny 'kennyS' Schrub <strong>France |&nbsp;Team&nbsp;EnVyUs</strong> In late 2014 and early 2015 kennyS was arguably the number one player in the world as the game s most dominant AWPer. Despite playing on a team barely in the top eight, he constantly put up performances that allowed Titan to compete with all of the world s best teams, and even score some strong tournament finishes. Since the AWP update he hasn t been as dominant, and it is possible the limited, in comparison, role he has on EnVy will never allow him to regain the top spot. Even through these changes, Kenny remains one of the world s best. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Photo via </em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> 9. Tyler 'Skadoodle' Latham <strong>USA | Cloud9</strong> While fans go crazy about shroud s exciting flick shots, the true star of Cloud9 and the player who makes the team who in the summer was a legitimate threat to contend for titles go, is Skadoodle&mdash;one of the world s best snipers. He s the best North American player&mdash;at least until Hiko fully returns&mdash;by far the most consistent player on Cloud9 and the team relies on his strong play more than anyone else s. It s possible Skadoodle will climb the rankings in the future, but his team must regain top form to do so&mdash;competing in North America won t help him here. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Photo via </em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> 8. Aleksandr 's1mple' Kostyliev <strong>Ukraine | HellRaisers</strong> Easily one of the most explosive players in the world, s1mple&mdash;the third AWPer so far on this list&mdash;has been outside of the spotlight since he left FlipSid3, seemingly out of the blue, after the team was knocked out of ESWC. Some of the statlines s1mple put together while playing in a tactical, but not very skilled F3 team are absurd. Once his ESL ban is up and he matures a little, he will become the number one player in the ex-CIS region, and you can expect him settle much higher in this ranking once he reaches his peak&mdash;he s still only 17. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Photo via </em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> 7. Robin 'flusha' Ronnquist <strong>Sweden | Fnatic</strong> flusha was the best player in fnatic for a long time, and his overall performance throughout 2014 was incredible. This year he has taken a backseat in the team while his teammates have shined brighter, but one must not discount his impact in fnatic s wins either. For one, he has the best stats overall across all the CS:GO majors to-date, and he is one of just three players ever to three majors&mdash;and one of five to win two. He has nearly perfected the passive playing style as a rifler, yet is still capable of flashy highlights when needed. flusha could conceivably be the best player on almost any team, but he has practically accepted a smaller role to ensure his team keeps winning. <em style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; background-color: initial;\">Photo via </em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> 6. Freddy 'KRiMZ' Johansson <strong>Sweden | Fnatic</strong> No one could have predicted the breakout performances KRiMZ had in late 2014. He was a role player on the successful LGB team, and had been without a team before fnatic picked him up last summer. That KRiMZ went onto have some of the best individual performances on that team is truly remarkable. He was not a player who caught a hot streak and went with it, his nearly flawless fundamentals, especially with the M4A1-S and AK-47, allowed him to elevate his level of play almost overnight, and what s more, he s stayed up there for a year now. A cornerstone in the world s best team s success, and easily one of the best players in CS:GO. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Photo via the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eslphotos/\">ESL Flickr</a> page</em> 5. Janusz 'Snax' Pogorzelski <strong>Poland |&nbsp;Virtus.pro</strong> Due to the way Virtus.pro is structured, a lot of the time their players go without the same kind of celebration that top players in other teams enjoy. There is no clear superstar in the Polish team, and at times all five of their players have good enough games to receive MVP awards. In any case, over the long haul the best player in Virtus.pro, and the most important one as well, has been Snax. He is an extremely versatile player, a part-in-game-leader, and probably the game s trickiest player. He was the MVP of ESL ESEA Dubai Invitational, the second-best player all-time at the majors, and you can bet any time he plays that well Virtus.pro will go deep in tournaments. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Photo via </em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> 4. Vincent 'Happy' Cervoni <strong>France |&nbsp;Team EnVyUs</strong> Happy might be the first in-game leader in Counter-Strike s history to have the kind of success individually that he has had. He gets criticized by many&mdash;including me&mdash;for baiting his teammates at times, in a fashion that almost looks like he s padding stats. In any case, he is the best player on EnVy, who have been a top three team for most of the past year, and has become the game s best lurker after GeT_RiGhT s decline. He can AWP, lead the world s best team, and play with just about every weapon out there. Happy is almost a complete player, and that kind of versatility is especially valuable. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Photo via the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eslphotos/\">ESL Flickr</a> page</em> 3. Ladislav 'GuardiaN' Kovacs <strong>Slovakia |&nbsp;Natus Vincere</strong> The lone Slovakian player&mdash;but the fourth main AWPer&mdash;on this list has been among the world s best since 2012, but aside from the brief period when his Virtus.pro team took down NiP, he did not enjoy the kind of success or fanfare that he likely deserved until Na`Vi broke through as a top tier squad in May 2014. Since then he has probably been the biggest carry in a top five team. Simply put, Na`Vi often lived and died with GuardiaN s performances. Lately he has gotten more help with the addition of flamie, but make no mistake&mdash;GuardiaN has been the most important player, on a team that was recently ranked second-best in the world, for a long time. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Photo via </em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> 2. Nicolai 'device' Reedtz <strong>Denmark | Team SoloMid</strong> It s safe to say that device has finally arrived. The Dane was championed as the next generation s f0rest or GeT_RiGhT by Thorin a long time ago, and it seemed only his nerves were holding him back from becoming an absolute force in the Counter-Strike world. Well, now he is one&mdash;device has been the best player on TSM while the squad has racked up multiple international wins and even more top three finishes. Much like peak-f0rest, he can both AWP and rifle at an elite level. No longer is he the player who goes MIA in big games and needs to be pulled across the finish line. The best player in the world s second-best team, device deserves the second spot in this ranking, and could easily edge his way to the top in the future. <em>Photo via&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\"><em>HLTV.org</em></a> 1. Olof 'olofm' Kajbjer <strong>Sweden | Fnatic</strong> This should come as no surprise to anyone who has been actively following the scene. Currently&mdash;and for a while now&mdash;the king of Counter-Strike has been fnatic s olofm, the player who has been the brightest star in the world s best team&mdash;ever&mdash;and has effectively broken through as perhaps the game s only superstar despite having three other incredibly skilled teammates. olofm has lived up to all the promises, and more, of the LGB days. Often he has been the difference between a top-three finish and another championship, and there is no player as scary in CS:GO currently as olofm having a good game&mdash;and other teams can surely testify to that. He is probably the game s most versatile player&mdash;able to play both passively and aggressively on both halves, and handle every weapon, both rifles and snipers, at an elite level. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we do not get to enjoy players like this too often. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "Picture credit: Sebastian Ekman The fall esports season begins in earnest this weekend, as many games return from their post-summer hiatus and shuffled team rosters settle into place. Qualifiers for a number of massive upcoming tournaments, including CS:GO s final major of the year, are mingled in with the first medium-stakes chance to see some of the new teams in action on a brand new Dota patch. There will also be some last ditch efforts to make it to next month s BlizzCon, and the action all kicks off today. Whether you re in the mood for Brazilian god-on-god action, or some European wizard fumbling, there s something to suit all your pro gaming needs this weekend. Here s what we ll be watching... StarCraft: 2015 DreamHack Stockholm Open Unusually for an esports event, DreamHack Stockholm ran much of its course during the week, meaning most of the event is already over. However the StarCraft finals are being played on Friday night, and for one player they mean everything. Being the last event awarding WCS points before BlizzCon, there is a chance for Ko HyuN Seok Hyun to sneak his way up from 18th place into the invited Top 16 of WCS rankings. A win today and he ll relegate Jung FanTaSy Myung Hoon, whom he defeated yesterday to make it to the quarter-finals. You can see if HyuN makes it on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacksc2\">official DreamHack StarCraft&nbsp;channel</a> from 10:15 PDT/18:15 BST with the Grand Final at 13:30 PDT/21:30 BST. Counter-Strike: DreamHack Cluj-Napoca Qualifiers at DreamHack Stockholm The CS:GO tournament at DH Stockholm is carrying on for another day, at least, so you can expect to catch a bit more of the action if you do something ridiculous like work during the week. The last remaining spots for DreamHack s next tour stop, Romania s Cluj-Napoca, are up for grabs and there are still a few familiar names waiting to snap them up. FlipSid3, Copenhagen Wolves and Dignitas, to name a few, will be playing Saturday from 03:05 PDT/11:05 BST until the final match at 12:05 PDT/20:05 BST. You can watch all that on&nbsp;<a href=\" http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhackcs\">DreamHack s official stream</a>. Counter-Strike: Gfinity Champion of Champions More CS:GO for the top tier teams already invited to Cluj-Napoca as Gfinity holds a four-team invitational. Fnatic, Ninjas in Pyjamas, Virtus.pro and EnVyUs play a short three-game bracket with the semi-finals on Saturday morning beginning 02:30 PDT/10:30 BST, and the Grand Final at the same time on Sunday. If you re up in time to catch that, you can see it on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/gfinitytv\">Gfinity s Twitch stream</a> but VODs will surely be available for late birds. Nanyang Dota 2 Championships: European Qualifiers After last week s Chinese Qualifiers, it s the Europeans turn, as almost every hot new roster shakes their tail feathers on the road to Nanyang. This weekend should be especially exciting as Dota s latest patch today means we ll see the clumsy evolution of a new meta before Frankfurt s Major next month. Saturday plays host to Kuroky s 5Jungz squad in a semi-final matchup against the Swedish Ninjas in Pyjamas at 11:00 PDT/19:00 BST, and a loser s bracket elimination between Team Empire and Vega Squadron before that at 09:00 PDT/17:00 BST. Sunday will feature the result of today s matches (Na`Vi versus (monkey) Business, and Alliance versus Monkey Freedom Fighters) at those same times. All can be watched on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit\">BTS Twitch channel</a>. SMITE Brazil Gaming League Season 2 A chance to see the finale of Latin America s toughest competition this Saturday, as the teams with one remaining game in hand compete in the last week of SPL s Brazilian league. There s only one game to look out for here, and that s the clash between current first and second place in the table, INTZ esports and Keyd Stars. INTZ, formed of SWC 2015 fifth-placers We Love Bacon have a slight advantage over Keyd who were penalised by one point at the beginning of the season for a late roster change. You can see that match play out on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/x5tv\">x5TV</a> Saturday at 14:00 PDT/22:00 BST Hearthstone: Abios Grand Tournament Lastly, a small $5,000 pot Hearthstone tournament with a surprising collection of stars should wile away the time until next weekend s European Road to BlizzCon. Names to watch for include current world champ Firebat, and European hopefuls ThijsNL, Ostkaka and Hoej. It s a single elimination event, which should provide some tension, though stakes are fairly low. More importantly it ll be a good chance to see what decks the European hopefuls are playing with before their BlizzCon qualifier showdown next week. Round of 16 matches start at 08:00 PDT/16:00 BST on Saturday, with the last at 14:30 PDT/22:30 BST, and the finals continue Sunday from 08:05 PDT/16:05 BST until the Grand Final at 15:40 PDT/23:40 BST.

So it makes sense that Darude the Finnish trance producer who's 'Sandstorm' went belatedly viral last year is currently working on a custom sound pack for <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>. Darude announced the news on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3m3kkx/darude_moments_csgo/\">Reddit</a>, where Counter-Strike fans (or Darude fans, I can't be sure) were generally positive about the news.&nbsp; Others had some useful suggestions. The producer didn't indicate when the sound pack would release, though that's him working on it at the top of the page. It's to help promote his new album Moments, which released in August.&nbsp; To jog your memory, here's 'Sandstorm'. If you don't need your memory jogged, just watch the video anyway.

        "contents": "Happy looking happy&nbsp;after Juan good round. Photo credit: DreamHack/Adela Szjnader. When it comes down to a final between two top-tier heavyweights, you expect all of your players to be on form&mdash;but&nbsp;when no less than four out of ten finalists close out rounds by killing <em>every member of the enemy team by themselves</em>, you ve found something special. The climax of this weekend s DreamHack London was one such occasion, as French team EnVyUs edged out Danish rivals Team SoloMid in a 2-0 stormer. The pair were the two most-highly seeded squads at the two-day event, so there was little surprise that they found their way to opposite sides of the final bracket. Resistance along the way came in the form of Copenhagen Wolves new roster, their old roster (now belonging to Team Dignitas with few modifications), SK Gaming, the Australian upstarts Renegade and&mdash;owing to the London location&mdash;two British teams: Gamers2 and EZSkins. The British are leaving: KennyS' amazing AWP triple As the final attests, resistance was futile&mdash;particularly for the ailing UK CS scene. Admirable though it is to feature the once-great nation s brightest hopes alongside previous DreamHack winners and ESL One contenders like TSM, the effect was akin to leaving lions to babysit lambs. Even former CS 1.6 and Source legends such as EZSkins Sam RattlesnK Gawn were no match for the inhuman AWPing skills of EnVy s latest addition Kenny KennyS Schrub. Assassin's creed: twist's acrobatic Glock headshot One team proving to at least resemble a thorn in both finalists sides was Copenhagen Wolves, managing to take second in TSM s group and coming up against EnVy in the semifinals. It s not much consolation for the squad, who lost convincingly to both teams, but CW s Simon twist Eliasson can be proud of what was the most unexpected play of the Sunday before the final began. Hopping off the B-site balcony on Mirage and showing some air control worthy of any Surf practice maps, the Swede lands a headshot on poor unsuspecting Nathan NBK- Schmitt to prove that the Wolves still have some bite. Down to the wire: Kio's almost-flawless victory However, after the lights dimmed and the final teams got serious on the Copper Box Arena s main stage, much of the weekend s action seemed to pale in comparison. The first indicator of which was EnVy s second round win on Dust II, having lost the pistol round. Halting TSM s early economic lead by wiping them out and taking their hard-earned guns prevented the usual snowball scenario of the pistol-round winner taking two or three more in a row. As such, the entire first half was kept incredibly close, with EnVy finishing ahead at 9-6. Heading into the second half pistol round with EnVy on the Counter-Terrorist side, the magic began as Fabien 'Kioshima' Fiey pulled off the first ace of the proceedings, only to lose the round as he ran out of time to defuse. Stay cool: Kioshima's burning sacrifice A mistake Kio made sure to rectify a mere 11 rounds later, to put EnVy into a strong match-point position. Having worked his way masterfully onto the A-site again, dispatching cajunB and safe in the knowledge that Karrigan was too low on health to risk a peek, he sets about defusing. Karrigan s elegant solution was to molotov the entire bomb area from safety. But Kio simply wasn t about to leave a job half done again and gives his life for the cause, as the final tick of burn damage kills him a fraction of a second after the defuse finishes. Swarm of bullets: Karrigan's revenge ace Having sent a strong statement by&nbsp;closing out Dust II 16-13, EnVy went about leaving their mark on Inferno too in the second map of the best-of-three. This time, winning the pistol round and following through with a natural economic advantage on the next two left them with a healthy 3-0 lead. Stepping up to the plate&mdash;and making up for not cooking a hot enough molotov in the last map&mdash;Finn 'Karrigan' Andersen threw down the second ace of the finals, mopping up the mess left on mid by teammate cajunB s perfectly timed grenade. Juan in a million: Happy's Desert Eagle rampage Match&nbsp;balance restored by Karrigan's ace,&nbsp;things remained square until well into the second half as EnVy took up defensive positions as Counter-Terrorists. Having let TSM back into the game and lost the second pistol round, they were struggling to find purchase and embarked on an&nbsp;'eco' round to save money for later. Completely undeterred by this situation, and&nbsp;with Desert Eagle in hand, Vincent 'Happy' Schopenhauer landed an impossible ace, with four near-perfect 'Juan Deag' single-tap headshots. Oh, snap: KennyS' lightning AWP reactions Spurred on by the heroics of his team-mate, and despite a losing streak after Happy s rampage, KennyS found the fourth ace of the night for EnVy to regain momentum. Not sated by that, he then went on an extremely aggressive push up into apartments with the AWP in order to land a snapshot so fast he may need a wrist splint for the next week. The 2-0 final score to EnVy belies how incredibly close and tense each map was, and the extent to which TSM stepped up to the plate. EnVy, however, have proven that&nbsp;their new roster&mdash;which prevented them appearing at the last DreamHack event, where&nbsp;TSM prevailed&mdash;is nothing short of terrifying. The teams won t need to wait long for a rematch, however, as DreamHack Stockholm begins this week and if both keep up this level of tense competition the Swedish crowd will only need the edge of their seats. And possibly a cardiologist. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "TRIGGERNOMETRY We write about FPSes each week in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/triggernometry\" target=\"_blank\">Triggernometry</a>, a mixture of tips, esports,&nbsp;and a celebration of virtual marksmanship. Beneath Counter-Strike s skin is a skeleton of interconnected systems: movement, location-specific damage modeling, and weapon behavior, to name a few. In last week s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-gets-new-animations-and-hitboxes/\">major patch release</a> Valve swapped out some significant bones in that skeleton. With a foundation built on a decades-old legacy favoring <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TtGQnyPZ6g\">tradition</a> over radical change, CS:GO s community has appraised this update as nothing short of historic. Beyond bug fixes, the meat of the patch delivers significant adjustments to CS:GO s steadfast core: hitboxes, animations, and weapon behavior. Here s how these changes affect the game&mdash;for casuals, pros, and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-400-virtual-knives-saved-counter-strike/\">skin-conomists</a> alike&mdash;and why they re important milestones in one of PC gaming s most storied shooters. Hitbox comparison image&nbsp; <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/egnKn\">by imgur user whats0n </a> Hitboxes CS:GO s long-lasting cuboid hitboxes&mdash;the invisible, body-hugging shapes critically governing bullet hit detection&mdash;has morphed into a capsule set with a more cylindrical configuration that better covers each part of the CT and T model. Each cylinder conforms to the body model s shape more closely than the hard edges of a cube, and the entire set provides a higher degree of overlap for accordingly increased precision in determining where incoming bullets should land (and, subsequently, how much damage is meted out). Valve also fixed inconsistent hitbox alignment that tended to crop up during certain movements such as jumping or hanging on ladders by forcing hitbox rigs to continuously shape to whatever motion the model is performing at all times: running, standing still, climbing, planting the bomb, and so on. <strong>Why it matters: </strong>At long last Valve has repaired CS:GO s an issue that s plagued the community for years. Dozens of demonstrations of misaligned hitboxes filled <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/search/?q=hitbox&amp;gidforum=882957625821686010&amp;include_deleted=1&amp;p=16\">forum threads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3glktz/the_problem_of_csgo_hitbox_system/\">Reddit posts</a>. Some examples were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXsHqe5dtuQ\">hilariously blatant</a>, some were more <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snZqkGJQ3qM\">analytical</a>, but they all pointed to a harmful obstacle of CS:GO s layers of strategy and skill. The now-continually synchronized hitboxes ensures shots will land precisely where they re sent to, and we can finally send a farewell salute to the unwelcome <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/UnlinedCavernousDesertpupfish\">immortal bomb-planter</a>. One interesting phenomenon to note is how the development and proliferation of the professional scene flourished in the face of faulty hitboxes. Pro teams, by virtue of their intimate knowledge of each minute aspect of the game, were acutely aware of how hit detection affected performance; they simply adapted and got used to it. Teams with star-led rosters such as Fnatic and EnVyUs will re-adapt in short time, but it ll be interesting to observe the process of unlearning years of habits. In theory, position control should turn even more rewarding for quick multi-frags with steady spray. Given the heightened payoff for shooting accuracy, 1v1 encounters will swing towards whoever is on the draw the fastest for tapping shots into the larger head hit-bubble. No longer is jump-peeking a safeguarded method for gathering intel, as it s now an exposing move with a heavy risk of a blink-and-gone <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/PolishedSlipperyApisdorsatalaboriosa\">reflex kill</a>. Animations New and improved animations for the worldview character model (the models of teammates and enemy players seen from your view) smooths out walking/running cycles and gives more natural physical behavior to the weapons and equipment adorning each model. In particular, full draw animations replace the former, jerky ones for guns and grenades, and switching items plays a neat holster sequence for whatever s being put away.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/ShorttermImpeccableArcticduck\">Ladder climbing looks better</a> but still hasn t lost the comedic awkwardness of watching someone sprinting up a vertical surface while gripping a rifle with both hands. Player and weapon models will also cull when up against a thin wall or doorway. That means any portion of the model that would stick out is automatically cut away to avoid erroneous clipping and unintentional giveaways from simply standing too close. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Though mostly cosmetic, the new animations better represent what a spotted player is doing moment to moment. Stronger-colored defusal kits are easier to pick out on the model, and cleaner-looking transitions to secondaries impart an important sign that an opponent s primary has run dry. Reports of <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/TediousLankyIbisbill\">distorted models</a> and players <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/LikableNeatArmedcrab\">flopping on the ground</a> have also surfaced in the days following the update. Model culling is a pretty significant boon for ambush-oriented players parking up against high-traffic chokepoints such as Nuke s squeaky and Dust 2 s double doors. It doesn t completely cover all angles&mdash;the tight corners of Inferno s banana still occasionally betray a popped-out barrel or two, for instance&mdash;but it does add fair variability to close-quarter positions typically avoided for wonky clipping. In a way it s more of a buff for the Terrorists, who now have to worry less about their barrels sticking through a door and signaling their attack. Defusals Many a round of CS:GO ends end with a solitary CT crouching over the beeping bomb. The patch majorly modifies that intimate man-on-explosive encounter by placing a multimeter in the defuser s hands with clearly visible cables running into the bomb while it s being defused. That s probably the most obvious Hey, I m interacting with this sign Valve could apply without breaking realism&mdash;defusers now look like military Spider-Men. <strong>Why it matters: </strong>Ninja and fake-out defusals are integral to strategic CS:GO play. The inclusion of the cables huge visual marker lowers the effectiveness of baiting bomb-guarding Ts into a surprise riposte. (One pro player even suggests cables be a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/G2Maikelele/status/644077270517293056\">spectator-side feature</a> only.) Ts can now check for cables on a shoulder-peek to determine if the defuse is true or not, but savvy CTs can set up for the next peek knowing that brandishing cables will likely draw out an opponent for a 1v1. A sneaky CT swooping in for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYAjIOhfmSk\">ninja defuse</a> is still possible, but it ll be much harder to pull off with Ts having more concrete information on when an actual defuse is happening. M4A1-S The silenced M4A1-S, a CT staple, has seen its fire rate reduced to a flat 600 RPM along with a slight increase to base bullet spread. Its price has dropped $100 to $3,100, a reversal of the cost hike implemented in the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-patch-notes-nerf-tec-9/\">March 31 patch</a>. Its armor penetration value has also shrunk by roughly 10 percent, but plenty posters have indicated the old value <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3li9pk/the_m4a1s_armor_nerf_is_not_in_effect_sorry_for/\">still accidentally exists</a> in the live version. <strong>Why it matters: </strong>Many players consider these changes as the M4A1-S death-knell, but the rifle s true fate isn t so cut-and-dried. Indeed, pro player input is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deviceCS/status/643937658029387776\">predictably</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nV_NBK/status/644092219507503104\">divisive</a>. The M4A1-S now fires at the same rate as the AK, a noticeable dip in damage output for close-range combat. Interestingly, the slower fire provides a higher amount of recoil decay in between each shot which leads to tighter handling at farther distances. It s easy to assume the M4A4, the unsilenced high-ammo brother to the M4A1-S, will claim the go-to CT gun crown, but the A1 will find use as an easily controllable brain-tapper at range. Pistols The flashy dual Berettas got a boost to armor penetration and range, both understandable buffs to bring the rarely glimpsed pistol choice in line with common handcannons. The Zeus taser has had its cost reduced to a miniscule $100 as a value buy for instant kills up close. <strong>Why it matters: </strong>Pistol changes invariably carry an economic ripple effect into later rounds of a match via shakeups in the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-win-eco-rounds-in-csgo/\">eco meta</a>. Although the likelihood of a drilled team adopting dualies over the reliability of the Tec-9, Five-Seven, or P250 is low, these modifications make the Berettas a safe buy during pistol rounds. Its extra armor penetration is good insurance against early round armor as they ll dome an unhelmeted player in one hit. We ll see the Zeus show up more often in loadouts due to its cheap price, but its usefulness still stays niche as a silly method for taking out a solitary player. <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/orvYVc6.jpg\">Zeus skins</a> are inevitable. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "It s no secret that the CS:GO s item economy can be quite profitable. Some of the game s rarest weapon skins are priced at over $1,000 (with rare collectors items approaching pricelessness). The constant and growing demand for skins by the game s players, and the slot machine-like experience of opening weapon cases in the slim hopes of getting a desirable skin, has created a huge, free-range capitalist market that allows all kinds of gambling, trading, and skin selling to take place outside of Valve s intended corral for such activity. As <a href=\"http://newyorksociologist.org/delany.pdf\">studies have shown</a>, prohibiting people from funneling and gambling capital tends to create an illicit market. When skins were introduced to CS:GO <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2013/08/7425/\">via the Arms Deal update</a> in August of 2013, it was only a matter of time before players would find a way to independently price, trade, and hoard skins in an increasingly complex economic network that sees some of its entrepreneurs supposedly <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/heres-how-you-make-12000-in-profit-a-day-selling-virtual-guns\">making over $12,000 a day</a>. But a new development in this CS:GO sub-culture gives cause for concern. This week CSGO Lounge, a skin trading and betting hub that is easily the most powerful and notorious of the lot, <a href=\"http://lounge.gg/\">decided to officially sponsor CS:GO team Dobry Gaming</a>. Dobry Gaming are a cadre of Polish players who are often considered the second best team within their country <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/15930-virtuspro-triumph-over-tsm\">after the elite Virtus.pro</a>. When three of their members were part of Games2, they may have been considered a top 20 team in the first half of 2015. CSGO Lounge is no stranger to controversy. The site survives frequent attacks on its network, the scorn of esports personalities <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sirscoots/status/564083952017604608\">who associate it with underage gambling</a>, and even recent investigations by mainstream media. Bloomberg News <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-07/professional-video-gaming-has-an-underage-gambling-problem\">piece on underage virtual gambling</a> specifically includes a video where the site s front page is seen. The site has weathered this scrutiny despite being an instrumental part of CS:GO s biggest controversy to date: the involvement of an elite North American team <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/esports/match-fixing-counter-strike-ibuypower-netcode-guides/\">in a massive match fixing scandal</a> that used the Lounge site to make over $10,000 in skins. This scandal was so severe that it prompted a direct response from Valve, who banned every player involved and said that no players or personalities involved in professional CS:GO should gamble on matches <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/01/11261/\">under any circumstances</a>. <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/gallery/view/40442\"> </a> Dobry Gaming, now Lounge Gaming,&nbsp;at Copenhagen Games 2015.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/gallery/view/40442\"><em>Image courtesy HLTV.org.</em></a> What this means for CS:GO With CSGO Lounge picking up Dobry Gaming, the water becomes even more muddied. On one hand, there has been a recent backlash against gambling sites being involved with high profile teams after a Cyprus-based bookmaker <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/15963-ebettle-becomes-vexed-gaming\">overhauled and renamed its esports division</a> in an attempt to separate the competitive brand from the betting service. With many more skin gambling sites <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/15969-csgoevo-white-team-forms\">acquiring mid-tier teams</a>, it is possible that the trend will continue. On the other hand, as multiple pundits and personalities involved in the scene have stated before, the growth of skin trading and skin betting directly correlates with the explosive growth of the game, especially as an esport. There is a lurking suspicion that the massive viewing numbers of CS:GO majors are due in part to the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-most-expensive-csgo-skins/\">expensive</a> in-game drops that viewers have a chance to receive. Players seem ambivalent and divided on the issue of betting, with some up-and-coming talent <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/38pbmi/neophye_stykd_we_just_dont_want_to_be_on/\">unable to handle the pressure</a> that their otherwise minimally-spectated games would bring. Others have fully embraced it. Watch any major CS:GO tournament these days and you ll see many professional players with name-tagged weapons branded with roulette-based gambling sites or skin-to-cash sites. For CSGO Lounge s team, Lounge Gaming, not much will be different in terms of their daily life. They will no doubt attend the upcoming DreamHack Stockholm event, which functions as a qualifier for the next CS:GO major at DreamHack Cluj-Napoca in Romania. Up to&nbsp;$300 total in&nbsp;CS:GO&nbsp;skins can be bet on a single match on CSGO Lounge. If the team should do so however, it will present an interesting quandary for Valve, who have partnered with DreamHack and PGL to organize the major. The developer has had an uneasy relationship with CSGO Lounge and its ilk, never condemning or interdicting their business but nevertheless allowing them to exist as a black market. Were Lounge Gaming to qualify for a major, Valve would have to, for example, produce an official sticker for the team, an in-game item that would <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/12836-the-stickeronomics-of-csgo\">directly finance</a> the team s players. There is no closing the Pandora s Box of skin gambling. The phenomenon is <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-400-virtual-knives-saved-counter-strike/\">so embedded</a> in the scene that an outright removal of the market would cripple Counter-Strike. For a betting site like CSGO Lounge, acquiring a competitive team is a step towards legitimacy. CS:GO teams, unlike skin trading and gambling, are increasingly bound by rules, regulations, and a degree of transparency. Forming a team is a shrewd move for a betting service which has begun to accumulate money and wants to remain involved in the scene while appearing more established overall. No one would dispute the call for greater regulation of esports gambling, both in the form of real money gambling sites and skin gambling. It s sorely needed as the service grows, both to combat <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/personal-investigation-of-suspicious-tf2-earbud-trading-uncovers-potentially-nefarious-scheme/\">illegal transactions</a> as well as to ensure competitive integrity beyond the scope which Valve can visibly control. Regulation can help enforce against underage gambling (at least on paper) and remake the entire sector into something that is more manageable. For now however, the show goes on. The complexity of such an issue is a hint that Valve, who has historically taken a laissez-faire approach to CS:GO esports, will inevitably&nbsp;have to intervene as groups like CSGO Lounge further define the values of the professional scene.

Most of the company s games will have a grand final of some kind&nbsp;or another at BlizzCon at the end of October, with qualifiers currently occurring across the world. Blizzard s latter-day fixation with confusing duplicate acronyms has returned with vigour: both the Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone world championships are called HWC . That s right! We live in a world where HotS refers to two different games and HWC to two different tournaments, and taken collectively this amounts to three different games. By the same studio.

The Heroes scene is still picking up steam, and this is one of its first high-profile championships and a chance to get on the ground floor with an emerging competitive game. In addition to five North American teams, the lineup also includes Relics from South East Asia, Team Immunity from Australia and New Zealand, and Furious Gaming from Latin America - it s more of an international contest than you might think. Doors open at 09:00 PDT if you re attending the live event, with the stream beginning at 10:00 PDT/18:00 BST. Watch it on the <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/BlizzHeroes\">official Heroes of the Storm Twitch channel</a>. Dota 2: ESL One New York 2015 Chinese Qualifiers There s not a huge amount of high-quality Dota 2 available this weekend, but you do have an opportunity to get up to speed with the Chinese scene. On Saturday morning at 03:00 PDT/11:00 BST, Vici.P and Newbee Young - both youth teams - will play a best of three. Then, at 06:30 PDT/14.30 BST, there ll be another between the new TongFu and TeamDK lineups. Watch them on the <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/esl_joindotared\">official ESL stream</a>. Counter-Strike: DreamHack Open at DreamHack London The PC is represented at the multi-game DreamHack London event by the DreamHack Open CS:GO tournament. A run of top-tier teams including EnVyUs and Team SoloMid will play for a prize pool of $40,000. The group stages will run on Saturday from 04:00 PDT/12:00 BST to 16:00 PDT/00:00 BST, with the semi-finals following on Sunday on the same schedule (although likely to run a little less long.) You can watch the entire thing at <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.tv/\">dreamhack.tv</a>. Smite: Gears of Fate Cognitive Invitational A chance to see the best North American Smite teams battle outside of the Pro League, Gears of Fate is hosted by the organisation that won the first Smite World Championship. Smite is in a great place right now, and frankly I'm a little mortified that I managed to miss this off the list first time around. You should definitely tune in: there's going to be a lot of high-quality Smite over the next few months in the run up to SWC 2016, and this is a chance to get to grips with the scene that dominated last year.

        "contents": "The Bayonet&nbsp;Crimson Web skin is worth&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-most-expensive-csgo-skins/\">thousands</a>. CS:GO s massive popularity eclipses its bizarre history.&nbsp;More than 8 million people play Counter-Strike every month. The average number of people playing CS:GO in August (357,535) was an incredible <a href=\"http://steamcharts.com/app/730\">14 times greater</a> than it was two years ago (25,961). Even Team Fortress 2, at the peak of its popularity, drew <a href=\"http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;appid=730q240q10q440&amp;from=0\">less than one-fifth</a> of the concurrent players that CS:GO does today. But if you crane your neck around the massive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLLoeaxPsqU\">conga line</a> of people who have discovered Global Offensive, you ll remember that, <em>oh right</em>, it was born as a port&mdash;partly meant to put Counter-Strike onto the previous generation of consoles before the end of their lifespan. When Valve and Hidden Path brought CS:GO to PAX in 2011 <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pax-2011-counter-strike-global-offensive-hands-on-preview-new-gear/1100-6331709/\">they demoed it exclusively on Xbox 360</a> and talked up, no joke, cross-platform play between PC and PS3 as a major feature (which was <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-to-arrive-this-summer-cross-platform-play-dropped/\">cut before release</a>). In 2012 it wasn t especially clear that Valve, who did not reply to a request for comment for this story, intended to dedicate significant resources to Global Offensive post-launch (memes about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2ywzfi/valve_time/\">the seemingly modest size</a> of Valve s CS:GO team were still being kicked around six months ago). Most of the production of CS:GO was done by Hidden Path, also known for the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/defense-grid-2-review/\">Defense Grid</a> series, who had about 30 people working on it before release. Valve's involvement grew continually during the final pre-launch phase, as Hidden Path CEO Jeff Pobst told me. The Glock Fade skin is worth about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Glock-18%20%7C%20Fade%20(Factory%20New)\">$260</a>. When I reached out to Hidden Path talk about CS:GO s origins, Pobst shed light on an the biggest challenge that CS:GO faced before release: how to unify the deeply entrenched Source and CS 1.6 communities under a single game. Initially we started working with the Valve folks to bring CS:S to console. The project grew over time to become something much larger because the folks at Valve were really interested in exploring if there was anything that could be done to try to bring together the two existing groups of CS players, said Pobst. Hidden Path and Valve faced a daunting task: making everyone happy. Appeasing not one, but two communities who are resistant to change is difficult enough without also having to woo people who didn t grow up on Counter-Strike. There were players who felt that CS 1.6 was a superior experience for their play style and there were other players who felt like CS:S was the best game for their play style, says Pobst. Sadly those two groups were very segmented and didn t play together. We started having a lot of discussions with Valve about what a product might look like&mdash;if it was even possible&mdash;that would become the favorite version of Counter-Strike for both existing player groups as well as for new players. And that was the main design focus behind most every decision that went into the development of CS:GO. Fresh&nbsp;paint Plenty of people did play CS:GO when it came out, but did not show hints of becoming the sensation that it is today for some time. <a href=\"http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=730q240q10&amp;from=1341126000000&amp;to=End+Time\">For a year after release, CS:GO wasn t even the most popular version of Counter-Strike</a>&mdash;some players were still <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike/comments/1ibjad/16_players_why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_csgo/\">actively debating</a> the merits of GO against its thirteen- and nine-year-old predecessors. What changed? Weapon skins. Almost exactly <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2013/08/7425/\">a year after release</a>, Valve introduced Team Fortress 2-style weapon drops to CS:GO, an event that coincides with the game <a href=\"http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=730q240q10&amp;from=1372662000000&amp;to=1383202800000\">permanently overtaking</a> its older siblings. This&nbsp;design decision put CS:GO on the trajectory to being the most popular game on Steam that isn t Dota 2. As ex-pro Tomi lurppis Kovanen puts it, Without the item economy Counter-Strike would be smaller. We would likely be at a level slightly above that of late 2013, and one similar to the peak years of Counter-Strike 1.6. There would be less money, no Valve-sponsored majors, and no one-million-viewer grand finals, says Kovanen, who contributes to&nbsp;PC Gamer. In hindsight, the addition of the skins has been the most important development in CS:GO's history, bar none. The addition of the skins has been the most important development in CS:GO's history. But why? After all, plenty of other FPSes have booster pack-like item systems or weapon customization that you don t have to pay to unlock. How has the addition of <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=&amp;category_730_ItemSet%5B%5D=any&amp;category_730_ProPlayer%5B%5D=any&amp;category_730_TournamentTeam%5B%5D=any&amp;category_730_Weapon%5B%5D=any&amp;category_730_Type%5B%5D=tag_CSGO_Type_Knife&amp;appid=730#p1_price_desc\">ultra-rare knives</a> and <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20M4A4%20%7C%20%E9%BE%8D%E7%8E%8B%20%28Dragon%20King%29%20%28Factory%20New%29\">questionable anime guns</a> lured so many people to Counter-Strike? Part of the explanation lies in how elegantly these decorated guns and knives integrate with fundamental aspects of Counter-Strike despite being purely cosmetic things. Something mostly unique to Counter-Strike, for example, is how much time you spend watching others play it. Death comes easily, and once slain you re pushed into someone else s eye sockets, where you re forced to gaze upon the ballistic eye candy of their painted guns.&nbsp; Wooden replicas of some of&nbsp;CS:GO's most coveted virtual&nbsp;knives, by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3gyuum/some_csgo_knifes_made_from_plywood/\">SeaNTea</a>. If that wasn't enough, Valve directly incentivized the act of watching&nbsp;CS:GO majors in-game or&nbsp;through Twitch with a linked Steam account: spectators of the biggest tournaments&nbsp;can&nbsp;win special edition Souvenir skins. Souvenir versions of rare weapons are <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-most-expensive-csgo-skins/\">some of the most valuable in the game</a>&mdash;a Souvenir Cerebus Galil, the second-tier Terrorist rifle, might fetch <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Souvenir%20Galil%20AR%20%7C%20Cerberus%20%28Factory%20New%29\">$230</a>. Likewise, picking up other players guns is a strategically valuable move&mdash;grabbing a dropped AWP saves your team from spending those resources from their own virtual pockets. (Any primary or secondary weapon will be automatically forced into your hands if you aren t carrying one, even.) But after weapon skins were added, taking your opponent s AWP or AK-47 took on a new meaning: it became a visual trophy. Spectators could see, presented in the UI, the gun owner s name. Killing someone with their own, bedazzled rifle became the ultimate insult. Valve even added a command that plays a custom look at my fancy weapon animation. Checking out your gun mid-match became a kind of taunt, especially if it was an opponent s. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-400-virtual-knives-saved-counter-strike/#page-2\"><em>Read more on the next page.</em></a> Conspicuous Consumption-Strike There s an even simpler explanation for the popularity that skins brought to Counter-Strike: they put money directly in the game. A lot of it. Not only did Counter-Strike have a persistent element for the first time, it had a form of progression that was worth real money. How much you d accumulated in CS:GO became a measure of how serious of a player you were. Skins became status symbols, bling that says something about you as a player. Holding a $2100 <a href=\"http://csgo.steamanalyst.com/id/120615/\">Dragon Lore AWP</a>, the CS:GO equivalent of a gold-plated Lamborghini, instantly validates you as a savvy or ultra-dedicated player&mdash;not only do you have taste, but you have the means or the passion to acquire something unavailable in stores &mdash;the Steam Market places a $400 limit on listings. No one could have predicted what would happen when one of the world s most skill-driven FPSes made fashion a feature. But it has had a substantial impact on Counter-Strike s competitive scene. Several third-party sites that allow players to bet skins on CS:GO esports matches have sprung up, one among them <a href=\"https://twitter.com/csgolounge_hub/status/580003570050838528\">claiming</a> to draw a million visitors each day. After weapon skins were added, taking your opponent s AWP or AK-47 took on a whole new meaning: it became a visual trophy. Just as significantly, professional teams have gained a steady source of revenue outside of sponsors and tournament winnings. Teams that play in major tournaments (like the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl-one-cologne-video-2015/\">ESL One Cologne</a>) receive a share of the sales of disposable in-game stickers associated with their team, and recently-added pro <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/08/12240/\">autograph stickers</a> contribute even more to the pot. Making $150,000 in pure sticker money&mdash;more than the tournament itself&mdash;is currently possible, says Kovanen, who analysed these <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/12836-the-stickeronomics-of-csgo\"> Stickernomics </a> last year. And despite <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\">match-fixing incidents</a> made possible by item gambling, most people in the scene will tell you that the addition of weapon skins has been extremely positive. have allowed for large betting companies and sites to be founded and existing ones to begin pouring money into the game, says Kovanen. Most importantly, beyond the visual improvements and the fun that is betting, it has made Counter-Strike incredibly much larger&mdash;it's been proven viewership grows exponentially when betting is available, and therefore the game as a whole would be a lot worse off without the item economy that has allowed for the game to flourish. The combination of being the best FPS game and a purely cosmetic item economy was what pushed CS to where it is today. Change or take either of those away and you would mess with success, says <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Miller_(Counter-Strike_player)\">Kyle Ksharp Miller</a>, a veteran professional CS player and co-founder of Team 3D. The true hardcore fans would still be there because they grew up on Counter-Strike, but I don't know if it would have attracted the next generation of players. The&nbsp;Hyperbeast skin for the&nbsp;M4A1-S. If you got it, brandish it When most people have something valuable, they want to flaunt it. They want to wear it out in public and have strangers ask about its origin or authenticity. Oh, this old thing? Owning a rare or expensive CS:GO skin became a status symbol, and an invitation to make videos, screenshots, or GIFs. CS:GO s most passionate skinthusiasts were, whether they knew it or not, highly-effective marketers. A mundane round of CS:GO s deathmatch mode can draw <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeveJi6qwd0\">hundreds of thousands of eyeballs</a> if it showcases a hyper-rare variant of an already hyper-rare skin. Almost 3 million people have heard the inspirational tale of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLjq625UhSo\">From Nothing to A Knife</a>, one player s saga of turning a $0.16 skin to a sub-$100 blade (set to some choice motivational speeches). CS:GO even has its equivalent to the depressingly popular <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6szTEZn1m4\">Kinder Egg opening videos</a>: case opening videos. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jkKk_GA58\">Millions of people</a>, as it turns out, will vicariously operate a slot machine that spits out virtual guns. And if you want to experience the thrill of opening virtual boxes without spending $2.50 a pop, you can poke around in a <a href=\"http://convars.com/case/\">crate-opening simulator</a>. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499733208\">Real-life replicas</a> of CS:GO are up for grabs <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/usr/spasmfingersnick\">on eBay</a> or <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/search?ref=gslsb&amp;q=cs%3Ago%20knife\">Etsy</a> (and are cheaper than their in-game equivalents). CS:GO went from being a mostly outsourced project meant to bring Valve s series to PS3 and Xbox 360 to the most popular competitive FPS of our generation. The money, popularity, and esports growth that skin mania has brought to Counter-Strike is immense, <a href=\"http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=730q240q10&amp;from=1341126000000&amp;to=End+Time\">measurable</a>, and will have long-lasting impact not only on CS but on other multiplayer games. But even players who are indifferent, or even critical of the way skins have altered a once-pure competitive game have benefited from their introduction. The wave of attention has encouraged Valve to make significant improvements to CS:GO. An&nbsp;influx of new players brought more&nbsp;cheaters (even in the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-competitive-scene-embroiled-in-hacking-scandal-as-three-players-are-banned/\">higher levels</a> of competitive play), but Valve has done a lot more&nbsp;to mitigate&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-cheaters-banned-in-record-numbers/\">and ban</a> them. Classic maps like&nbsp;Train that were initially&nbsp;flawed in CS:GO&nbsp;have been <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-gets-reimagined-train-map/\">reworked</a>. And although CS:GO's tournaments don't yet&nbsp;reach the pomp and level of reward as The International, Valve puts up $250,000 for multiple <a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/Premier_Tournaments\">majors</a> throughout the year. Even earlier this week Valve&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-gets-new-animations-and-hitboxes/\">rebuilt</a> CS:GO s hitboxes,&nbsp;animations,&nbsp;and netcode work together, a seemingly mundane update that in fact addresses a long-standing complaint from hardcore players.

        "contents": "CS:GO skins and all other Steam Market items are subject to a $400 maximum listing price. Items are often sold for greater sums through key trades, a sub-currency of the CS:GO economy. A single CS:GO key costs $2.50 USD and can be sold on the Steam Marketplace. To break through the $400 ceiling, you convert your listing price to a key value. If you want to sell an item for $500, divide your listing price by the key value, 500 by 2.5: 200 keys. Most people use third-party trading websites to list CS:GO s rarest wares, but once a trade is made, those keys can be sold back into the Steam Marketplace. There are some skins in our list that definitely break that cap, but due to both the extraordinary rarity of these items and their inconsistent prices in the key market, we ve pulled our best estimates from varying trading sites.

Either way, it's an added expense, but if buyers stand still and squint closely, they can actually see the detail they paid for. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid%3A730+Glock-18%20Fade\" target=\"_blank\">Fade, Factory New </a> The Assault Collection, August 2013 If you want a weapon skin that looks like it was created with a single click on a Photoshop gradient, look to the Fade for the Glock-18. Pricey due to its status as a default weapon (despite not having StatTrak), it still moves dozens of units a week, but its sheer ugliness makes it easy to understand why one poor dope sold his for $5.17 back in early May 2014. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid%3A730+P2000%20Ocean%20Foam\" target=\"_blank\">Ocean Foam, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Bravo Collection, September 2013 There's not much difference between the prices of the Factory New or Minimal Wear versions of the Ocean Foam skin for the P2000, so you might as well go with a new one. Or, maybe spend that money on gas and drive to the nearest beach to frolic in some real, actual ocean foam.

Over time, it settled down to a measly 500 or so key average. Pocket change, really. There are that many CS:GO keys between my couch cushions at any given moment. <em>Before you overspend, read our </em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-awp-guide-tips/\"><em>AWP guide</em></a><em>.</em> <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid%3A730+FAMAS%20Spitfire\" target=\"_blank\">Spitfire, Factory New </a> The Alpha Collection, September 2013 Painting a mouth on the front of a WWII fighter? Very cool. Painting one on the front of a rifle? Mm, doesn't really work. It basically looks like the gun was dropped in wet paint. There are plenty of better looking (and cheap) FAMAS skins, if you ask me. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20G3SG1%20%7C%20The%20Executioner%20%28Minimal%20Wear%29\" target=\"_blank\">The Executioner, StatTrak, Minimal Wear</a> The Revolver Case Collection, December 2015 The Executioner has been painted with a gruesome display of bone. Damn right it s gruesome. For 250 bucks of bone, the gruesome-per-capita better be sky high! Check out those two bones on the side, crossed over one another in an X <em>gruesome.</em> <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Souvenir%20Galil%20AR%20%7C%20Cerberus%20%28Factory%20New%29\">Cerberus, Souvenir, Factory New </a> The Cache Collection, November 2014 If you re looking to maximize your dogs per skin, boy, do we have a deal for you! There s a three-headed demon beast emblazoned on the side of this gun, which is mighty cool. Maybe not 200 bucks cool, but that s the price you pay for triple the dog. <a href=\"https://csgostash.com/skin/742/M4A1-S-Chanticos-Fire\" target=\"_blank\">Chantico s Fire, StatTrak, Factory New</a> The Chroma 3 Collection, April 2016 This M4A1-S skin is a short story in absolutes. Chantico is the Aztec goddess of fires in hearths (cozy, pop down here, let s cuddle, etc.) and volcanos. She s also the goddess of precious things, which is extremely appropriate for such a unique CS:GO skin. Don t touch it. Mine. <a href=\"http://csgo.steamanalyst.com/id/117351/\">Howl, StatTrak Factory New </a> The Huntsman Collection, May 2014 Your GUN won't be the ONLY thing howling if you drop that much cash on a Howl skin: your WALLET will ALSO be howling! Ha ha! But seriously, you could feed a family of five for like a while with that much money. The Howl's extraordinary price is due to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-weapon-skin-removed-after-dmca-takedown-notice/\">the unusual controversy</a> that followed it after release, which included the gun's removal from distribution but not from owners' inventories. CS:GO stopped dropping new Howls long ago, so the lucky initial owners of this lion-faced piece of copyright infringement own one of the most coveted status symbols in the game. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20SCAR-20%20%7C%20Cardiac%20%28Factory%20New%29\" target=\"_blank\">Cardiac, StatTrak, Factory New</a> The Vanguard Collection, November 2014 Let s go, Broncos! is what the average Cardiac owner says at least four times a game. Or I like basic color theory in blockbuster films! again, four times minimum. Maybe My favorite colors are blue and orange in no particular order! but no more than twice. No one likes a boisterous color fan. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20SG%20553%20%7C%20Ultraviolet%20%28Factory%20New%29\" target=\"_blank\">Ultraviolet, StatTrak, Factory New</a> The Arms Deal Collection, August 2013 If you can see the color of this skin, congratulations, you can see x-rays. If you can see a bunch of x-rays, I m sorry, that s probably very bad. At least you know your SG 553 is not just violet, but ultraviolet and that there s more to this life than meets the eye. 55 bucks well spent. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid%3A730+SSG%2008%20Blood%20in%20the%20Water\" target=\"_blank\">Blood in the Water, StatTrak, Factory New </a> The Arms Deal 2 Collection, November 2013 This gun has a shark on it, which makes you, the owner of said gun, a shark as well. I'm like a shark when I play, even without this gun. I immediately flop to the ground and die. In other news, good lord, that's a lot of money for a shark gun that doesn't launch actual sharks at players. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20MAC-10%20%7C%20Graven%20%28Factory%20New%29\" target=\"_blank\">Graven, StatTrak, Factory New</a> The Bravo Collection, October 2013 It breaks two commandments at the same time might be the eternal peak for CS:GO gun skin flavor text. The Graven is worth the $100 just for the goofs. But which two commandments? We ll let you puzzle that one out on your lonesome. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid%3A730+MP7%20Whiteout\" target=\"_blank\">Whiteout, Factory New </a> The Office Collection, August 2013 You can buy this skin for the MP7 that turns it completely white, which is coincidentally the color objects in games look when their skins don't load at all. So... money well spent, I'd say. <a href=\"https://csgostash.com/skin/13/MP9-Bulldozer\" target=\"_blank\">Bulldozer, Factory New</a> The Assault Collection, August 2013 This bone crusher is a devastator isn t the most colorful flavor text, even if the skin itself is a bright construction helmet yellow.

If only the flavor text wasn t a wheel-spinning portentous prophecy. Every predator eventually meets their end. Well, sure. Death is a thing. Truly, this is a skin for the most melancholic of CS:GO players; those who prioritize poesy over precision. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20PP-Bizon%20%7C%20Judgement%20of%20Anubis%20%28Factory%20New%29\" target=\"_blank\">Judgement of Anubis, StatTrak, Factory New</a> The Chroma 3 Collection, April 2016 For a game without respawns, invoking Anubis, an Egyptian god associated with mummification and rebirth, seems a bit off brand. But, phonetically, Anubis sounds like someone important and powerful, which is enough for some, but he s also a person with a dog head, and who doesn t love dogs? Or at least the head part of the dog? No? <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid%3A730+P90%20Death%20by%20Kitty\" target=\"_blank\">Death By Kitty, StatTrak, Minimal Wear </a> The eSports 2013 Collection, August 2013 Also known mockingly as the \"Pro 90,\" the significant amount of surface area is put to good use here by covering CS:GO's most powerful SMG in multicolored cat skulls. I'm not mad, just disappointed. I'm also not surprised you're both popular and expensive. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid%3A730+MAG-7%20Hazard\" target=\"_blank\">Hazard, Factory New </a> The Alpha Collection, September 2013 This mag-fed shotgun has a construction-themed paint job, which means you can yell PARDON OUR DUST after you kill someone.

As an addendum, the more stickers placed on that thing, its coolness grows exponentially. This Souvenir XM1014 has three stickers on the side, which qualifies it as an honorary prom king or queen in at least 20 different countries. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/M249%20%7C%20Blizzard%20Marbleized%20%28Factory%20New%29\" target=\"_blank\">Blizzard Marbleized, Factory New</a> The Office Collection, August 2013 Use this gun skin and go prone on CS:GO s many eternally blizzarding arctic maps for a huge camouflage advantage. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Negev%20%7C%20Anodized%20Navy%20%28Factory%20New%29\" target=\"_blank\">Anodized Navy, Factory New</a> The Assault Collection, August 2013 This Negev is navy blue in spots. Do you like navy blue? How many dollars deep is your love for navy blue? <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Sticker%20%7C%20iBUYPOWER%20(Holo)%20%7C%20Katowice%202014\">Marketplace link</a> Valve introduced cosmetic stickers to CS:GO in February 2014. Normally these are some of the cheapest items on the market <a href=\"http://csgostash.com/sticker/16/Banana\">a referential image of a funny banana man</a> might set you back $0.84, for example. Although the Contraband <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Sticker%20%7C%20Howling%20Dawn\">Howling Dawn</a> sticker goes for about $100, the first-edition esports stickers are by far the priciest. Among them, Team iBUYPOWER s holographic sticker reaches a whole other level, seemingly due to the fact that the team was banned by Valve and dissolved after the discovery that they <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\">fixed matches for their own benefit</a>. Although no listings exist at the time we re publishing this, there are several auto-buy orders for this controversial digital logo at $400. <a href=\"http://csgo.steamanalyst.com/id/109542020\" target=\"_blank\">Crimson Web, StatTrak, Factory New</a> (Field Tested pictured) For now, the Crimson Web M9 Bayonet is the most expensive item in Counter-Strike. Knives are arguably the CS mascot, so it s not that surprising so much value gets placed a long, deadly implement stored on your pants that tracks the number of people you ve stabbed with it. Nothing weird about that at all, nope. If I m being honest, there are much cooler-looking knives that can be had for just a couple hundred, like the <a href=\"http://csgostash.com/skin/377/Huntsman-Knife-Fade\">Huntsman Fade</a> or one of the raptorlike <a href=\"http://csgostash.com/weapon/Karambit\">Karambit</a> skins.

        "contents": "Tennis players know the peculiar feeling of zenlike calm and control that comes with starting a serve. Suddenly, all worries about footwork, planning drop shots, and recovering from an opponent s serve dissipate: the pace of the game rests in the palm of your hand. Wielding Counter-Strike s deadliest gun is a little like that. Like a great tennis player, talented AWPers have a mixture of patience and confidence. They tap into a slow mindset and lightning reflexes simultaneously. The AWP is an intimidator, both when it s pointed at you and when you re learning the weapon. Carrying an AWP isn t simply an equipment decision, but a discipline in and of itself with its own set of techniques, guidelines, and pitfalls. The basics of the AWP The AWP is heavy, powerful, and expensive. Its reputation arises from the fact that, in a game about eliminating other players from the round, it s the only weapon that can kill someone with one body shot. However, it isn t a one-hit kill in all circumstances, as leg and lower groin shots deal 85 damage (aka legging ), as do shots that clip through surfaces such as railings or corners. With the AWP s great power comes equal responsibility. Whether in a 5-on-5 competitive game or in casual mode, you ll put down $4,750 to buy an AWP. If that investment doesn t pay off (or worse, if an opponent kills you and steals it), it can break your team s economy for rounds to come. Other than the autosniper (aka the G3SG1/SCAR-20), the same can t be said for other investments in CS:GO. Certain aspects of the AWP make it unwieldy to the newcomer, including its effect on mobility. A player running with the knife moves at 250 units per second; with a USP-S, 240 units per second; with the AK-47, 215; with the AWP, a mere 200 units per second&mdash;20 percent slower than with a knife. Only the light machine guns, the Negev and the M249 (195 units), are slower. The AWP s firerate is equally slow, placing huge importance on hitting your first shot. The Scout, the AWP s cheaper sibling, features a similarly slow firerate but allows for insanely high mobility, even when scoped-in (unlike the AWP). And like many of CS:GO s guns, the AWP is sensitive to movement, requiring near-perfect stillness to execute an accurate shot (see the Advanced Techniques section for more on this). AWPers are thus faced with the dilemma of holding static angles that easily fall prey to flashbangs and pincer-pushes onto bombsites. But the AWP has more advantages still. It boasts the best penetration in-game, both in terms of wall penetration power with a value of 250 (this value ranges from 0-300, with a higher value indicating that a bullet can penetrate <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=275573090\">harder surfaces at longer distances</a>) but also in terms of armor penetration (97.5 out of 100 in the in-game menu, the highest in the game, which in effect nullifies the damage-softening effect of armor). The right combination of guesswork and timing can lead to <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/BluePinkBurro\">impossible shots that defy logic</a>. When should I buy an AWP? If you want to buy an AWP in a competitive game, the best time to do it is on the first gun round of the game (typically the fourth round) and when you re carrying at least $5,750. Even if your team has lost the first three rounds, secured zero objectives, and you personally didn t notch a kill over that time, you ll have earned $6,700 total by round four, including your initial $1,000 of starter cash. The most effective AWPer will spend even more to purchase a set of grenades, about $6,450. Here s your shopping list for a solid buy: * AWP - $4,750; * Kevlar &amp; helmet - $1,000; * Two flashbangs and a smoke grenade - $700; Buy an AWP without armor, and you re making a glass cannon buy. It s an enormous risk&mdash;you re turning yourself into a slow-moving cannon with no protection, not only to damage, but to the accuracy-disrupting effects of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aaH6dYTZYU\">aim punch</a>. Avoid AWPing without full armor except in the most desperate straits, like when your opponent is on the verge of winning the match. If your teammate in competitive mode has bought an AWP, reconsider buying another one. There are situations where the map will dictate otherwise (double AWPing as CT on de_dust2 is viable due to its long sight lines on A, B, and mid), but the economic risk is rarely worth the potential gain. In casual mode on the other hand, buying an AWP is merely a matter of buying cheaply for a round or two to save up for Big Green. The two styles of AWPing Broadly, there are two situations in which you ll use an AWP: covering an angle while stationary (passive AWPing), or while roaming (aggressive AWPing). In the professional CS:GO scene, players like Titan s SmithZz and the Danish player nico (who <a href=\"http://team-dignitas.net/articles/news/Team-Dignitas/7946/team-dignitas-csgo-schneider-replaces-nico\">was recently replaced on Dignitas</a>) fit into the passive style, while EnVyUs kennyS or Fnatic s JW tend to play aggressively. Passive AWPing best works at corners where you have the option of retreating behind solid cover, where you can protect yourself until the AWP is ready to fire again (e.g. the box at the back corner of B site on de_dust2). Passive players only have to worry about one angle, avoiding getting flashed or smoked out of their roost, and hitting the shot. Passive AWPers are also the ones who have to worry the most about the maximum zoom setting when scoped-in. The AWP features two zoom settings which right clicking cycles through: one further out and a magnified one. As a rule of thumb to the young AWP initiate, use the single-zoom setting in all of your duels. A passive AWPer holding a long position such as from bombsite A towards pit on de_dust2 should consider using the maximum zoom setting to increase chances of hitting a distant, protected target. AWPers planning on holding close angles or playing with mobility should avoid the maximum zoom setting in almost all circumstances, as it inhibits reaction to unexpected threats. Aggressive AWPers have a much more complex portfolio to work with in terms of using the gun. For them, techniques such as walking while scoped in and searching for enemies have no place, as the maximum field of vision and information is required in order to hit lightning-fast shots. These players rely on advanced techniques of AWPing. <a href=\"http://pcgamer.com/how-to-awp/#page-2\"><em>Learn specific AWPing&nbsp;techniques on the next page.</em></a><em> </em> Advanced techniques As an aggressive AWPer, you re defying some of the native characteristics of the AWP to gain map control. The aggressive AWPer needs to know when to push angles that would seem <a href=\"http://oddshot.tv/shot/esl-csgo-20150910191245818\">suicidal in normal scenarios</a> and often wield their slow, clunky weapon more like a shotgun than a sniper rifle. The aggressive AWPer uses a two-handed sword as if it were a one-hander, relying on speed, intuition, and tricks to gain the advantage. Passive AWPing can only take you so far. Think of it this way: holding an angle won t work if you meet <a href=\"http://oddshot.tv/shot/esl-csgo-2015091018528241\">an opponent who s quicker on the draw</a>. Aggressive AWPers incorporate movement and manipulative model tricks (peeking at certain angles crouched or with a varying speed) to defeat their opponents. Crouch-peeking and shoulder-peeking relies on the inherent advantage that comes with peeking in CS:GO (check&nbsp; <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/ImportantIllfatedCoati\">this GIF</a> below for a visual representation) by turning corners quickly, scoping in, and firing with a little bit of guesswork. Although some of this technique relies on popping out at an unexpected place or time, it s also underpinned by two mechanics of the game itself. AWPers use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk\">corner advantage</a>, the Source engine s preference for the camera to be slightly left-of-center, allowing them to see an opponent just a moment before they see you. To <strong>shoulder-peek</strong>, you should quickly strafe a corner or known angle with a shot in mind, scope-in and automatically fire, and strafe back in the opposite direction right away; all of this should be one fluid motion with no delay except to stop and quickly shoot. This technique tries to limit the chances of being prefired or tagged, and keeps you mobile as an AWPer. <strong>Crouch-peeking</strong> adds one more element to this act of angle manipulation, by bringing the player into a crouched-state as they round a corner. This is meant to throw off a defensive player whose crosshair, if they re experienced, is most likely aimed at head height. To crouch-peek, hold the crouch key as you round a corner, falling into your aim in one motion. In the brief moment that you re stationary, you should be crouched, scoped-in, and aiming at an angle that you are looking to clear. Chances are the opponent is trying to correct his aim and you ve got a clear shot! Aggressive AWPers have to master this quick input of keys: crouch, strafe, scope-in, and fire, without doing any of these commands too quickly or else the recoil is thrown off. The crouch key needs to be pressed exactly as the player rounds the corner, and not before or after. <strong>Quickscoping</strong> is a technique where right-clicking is immediately followed by a left click, granting a more accurate shot than you would have by noscoping. To try a quickscope, stop moving, then right and then left click in rapid succession. Practice this technique in casual play so you ll have more opportunities to buy the AWP and less pressure to contribute to a victory. <strong>Noscoping</strong>, or the art of using the AWP like it s the world s largest pistol, is still functional and sees <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIMi2wFlHOI&amp;t=52s\">occasional use by pro players</a> in the highest echelon of CS:GO. Noscoping is often the best and only choice when someone is rushing you head-on. If you find yourself in this situation, dip your aim to around center of mass on an enemy, stop moving as much as possible before you shoot, trust your muscle memory, and wait until the last possible moment to fire to maximize the angle and distance between you and your target s hitboxes. <strong>Wallbanging</strong> is Counter-Strike s tasteful way of referring to shooting through hard map surfaces. There are certain angles that only an AWP (or an autosniper as well) can penetrate and several of these happen to be in very useful positions. As seen in these clips on de_cache, preset angles can be used to try and tag players on the other side of the map. The best way to try this yourself is to load a map on an offline server (simply type map de_dust2 in console, for example), then enter sv_showimpacts 1 in the console to track bullet penetration and search for new spots. Lastly, and very infrequently, the AWP is able to hit accurate shots at the apex of a jump, similar to the notorious Scout jumpshot but far less dependable and requiring near perfect timing. Rarely seen, this technique is best left to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0lstyj3qDs&amp;t=10s\">hyper-aggressive players willing to take the risk</a>. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

Avoid AWPing without full armor except in the most desperate straits, like when your opponent is on the verge of winning the match. If your teammate in competitive mode has bought an AWP, reconsider buying another one. There are situations where the map will dictate otherwise (double AWPing as CT on de_dust2 is viable due to its long sight lines on A, B, and mid), but the economic risk is rarely worth the potential gain. In casual mode on the other hand, buying an AWP is merely a matter of buying cheaply for a round or two to save up for Big Green. The two styles of AWPing Broadly, there are two situations in which you ll use an AWP: covering an angle while stationary (passive AWPing), or while roaming (aggressive AWPing). In the professional CS:GO scene, players like Titan s SmithZz and the Danish player nico (who <a href=\"http://team-dignitas.net/articles/news/Team-Dignitas/7946/team-dignitas-csgo-schneider-replaces-nico\">was recently replaced on Dignitas</a>) fit into the passive style, while EnVyUs kennyS or Fnatic s JW tend to play aggressively. Passive AWPing best works at corners where you have the option of retreating behind solid cover, where you can protect yourself until the AWP is ready to fire again (e.g. the box at the back corner of B site on de_dust2). Passive players only have to worry about one angle, avoiding getting flashed or smoked out of their roost, and hitting the shot. Passive AWPers are also the ones who have to worry the most about the maximum zoom setting when scoped-in. The AWP features two zoom settings which right clicking cycles through: one further out and a magnified one. As a rule of thumb to the young AWP initiate, use the single-zoom setting in all of your duels. A passive AWPer holding a long position such as from bombsite A towards pit on de_dust2 should consider using the maximum zoom setting to increase chances of hitting a distant, protected target. AWPers planning on holding close angles or playing with mobility should avoid the maximum zoom setting in almost all circumstances, as it inhibits reaction to unexpected threats. Aggressive AWPers have a much more complex portfolio to work with in terms of using the gun. For them, techniques such as walking while scoped in and searching for enemies have no place, as the maximum field of vision and information is required in order to hit lightning-fast shots. These players rely on advanced techniques of AWPing. <a href=\"http://pcgamer.com/how-to-awp-guide-tips/#page-2\"><em>Learn specific AWPing&nbsp;techniques on the next page.</em></a><em> </em> Advanced techniques As an aggressive AWPer, you re defying some of the native characteristics of the AWP to gain map control. The aggressive AWPer needs to know when to push angles that would seem <a href=\"http://oddshot.tv/shot/esl-csgo-20150910191245818\">suicidal in normal scenarios</a> and often wield their slow, clunky weapon more like a shotgun than a sniper rifle. The aggressive AWPer uses a two-handed sword as if it were a one-hander, relying on speed, intuition, and tricks to gain the advantage. Passive AWPing can only take you so far. Think of it this way: holding an angle won t work if you meet <a href=\"http://oddshot.tv/shot/esl-csgo-2015091018528241\">an opponent who s quicker on the draw</a>. Aggressive AWPers incorporate movement and manipulative model tricks (peeking at certain angles crouched or with a varying speed) to defeat their opponents. Crouch-peeking and shoulder-peeking relies on the inherent advantage that comes with peeking in CS:GO (check&nbsp; <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/ImportantIllfatedCoati\">this GIF</a> below for a visual representation) by turning corners quickly, scoping in, and firing with a little bit of guesswork. Although some of this technique relies on popping out at an unexpected place or time, it s also underpinned by two mechanics of the game itself. AWPers use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk\">corner advantage</a>, the Source engine s preference for the camera to be slightly left-of-center, allowing them to see an opponent just a moment before they see you. To <strong>shoulder-peek</strong>, you should quickly strafe a corner or known angle with a shot in mind, scope-in and automatically fire, and strafe back in the opposite direction right away; all of this should be one fluid motion with no delay except to stop and quickly shoot. This technique tries to limit the chances of being prefired or tagged, and keeps you mobile as an AWPer. <strong>Crouch-peeking</strong> adds one more element to this act of angle manipulation, by bringing the player into a crouched-state as they round a corner. This is meant to throw off a defensive player whose crosshair, if they re experienced, is most likely aimed at head height. To crouch-peek, hold the crouch key as you round a corner, falling into your aim in one motion. In the brief moment that you re stationary, you should be crouched, scoped-in, and aiming at an angle that you are looking to clear. Chances are the opponent is trying to correct his aim and you ve got a clear shot! Aggressive AWPers have to master this quick input of keys: crouch, strafe, scope-in, and fire, without doing any of these commands too quickly or else the recoil is thrown off. The crouch key needs to be pressed exactly as the player rounds the corner, and not before or after. <strong>Quickscoping</strong> is a technique where right-clicking is immediately followed by a left click, granting a more accurate shot than you would have by noscoping. To try a quickscope, stop moving, then right and then left click in rapid succession. Practice this technique in casual play so you ll have more opportunities to buy the AWP and less pressure to contribute to a victory. <strong>Noscoping</strong>, or the art of using the AWP like it s the world s largest pistol, is still functional and sees <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIMi2wFlHOI&amp;t=52s\">occasional use by pro players</a> in the highest echelon of CS:GO. Noscoping is often the best and only choice when someone is rushing you head-on. If you find yourself in this situation, dip your aim to around center of mass on an enemy, stop moving as much as possible before you shoot, trust your muscle memory, and wait until the last possible moment to fire to maximize the angle and distance between you and your target s hitboxes. <strong>Wallbanging</strong> is Counter-Strike s tasteful way of referring to shooting through hard map surfaces. There are certain angles that only an AWP (or an autosniper as well) can penetrate and several of these happen to be in very useful positions. As seen in these clips on de_cache, preset angles can be used to try and tag players on the other side of the map. The best way to try this yourself is to load a map on an offline server (simply type map de_dust2 in console, for example), then enter sv_showimpacts 1 in the console to track bullet penetration and search for new spots. Lastly, and very infrequently, the AWP is able to hit accurate shots at the apex of a jump, similar to the notorious Scout jumpshot but far less dependable and requiring near perfect timing. Rarely seen, this technique is best left to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0lstyj3qDs&amp;t=10s\">hyper-aggressive players willing to take the risk</a>. <strong><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/pro/\">PC Gamer Pro</a></strong> is a new channel dedicated to esports and competitive gaming.

        "contents": "The ESL One Cologne Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournament that wrapped up this weekend with an <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl-one-cologne-video-2015/\">exciting win for Fnatic</a> was the first event in which competitors were subject to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl-to-begin-randomized-drug-testing-at-esl-one-cologne/\">randomized drug testing</a>. And you'll never guess who was caught trying to cheat! Really, you won't, because I'm about to tell you: The answer is nobody. A bundle of interesting figures came out of the Cologne event courtesy of ESL, including that it was the most-watched CS:GO event of all time. More than 27 million unique viewers spent a combined total of nearly 34 million hours watching the action on Twitch, including a a peak concurrent user count of over 1.3 million. That represents an increase of more than 30 percent over the ESL One Katowice CS:GO tournament in March. \"ESL One Cologne followed in the footsteps of ESL One Frankfurt in that it transformed a mere esports event into an esports festival,\" ESL said in a statement. \"Visitors on-site were able to take part in many festival-like experiences including bullriding, testing their reflexes on a T-Wall, and getting an airbrush tattoo, brought to them by ESL s sponsors/partners.\" That's all very positive news, but what I find more interesting is that the newly-implemented drug testing came up with nothing. \"Following up on the earlier announcement of ESL s partnership with WADA and NADA to create and implement the anti-doping policy, NADA has prepared a prevention program which was presented to players and visitors during the event,\" it continued. \"ESL conducted randomized anti-doping testing among players in the competition, which returned negative results for all tested players.\" An ESL rep declined to say how many players were tested, citing the need to maintain confidentiality of its process. ESL said it will continue to implement the new drug testing policy at&nbsp;all future ESL One events. ",

Things were not going well for the best CS:GO team in the world.&nbsp; Yesterday on one of the biggest stages in esports, the grand finals of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.esl-one.com/csgo/cologne-2015/standings/\">ESL One Cologne</a> major, Swedish superstars Fnatic were stumbling.&nbsp;$100,000 was on the line, and their opponent, Team EnVyUs (formerly Team LDLC), was crushing them on Dust2, the first map of a best-of-three. At this point in the match (and in the video above)&nbsp;EnVyUS&nbsp;led 14-7&mdash;they simply needed to win two more rounds to take the first map. Now, in the 22nd round,&nbsp;Fnatic had fragile&nbsp;control of bombsite B in a three-on-four situation.&nbsp; KRIMZ's work over the next minute&nbsp;may have saved Fnatic. He&nbsp;makes a strong entry frag through tunnel&nbsp;to secure the site, then takes a position behind car on bombsite B. He eats a pop flash thrown by the CTs, who are in the site before he recovers from the flash. Popping back up, KRIMZ&nbsp;chews through two of the attackers, going deep into his spray,&nbsp;adjusting beautifully from right to left. Now in a one-on-one,&nbsp;with nine bullets in his mag and his gun recoil&nbsp;jumping like an angry bull,&nbsp;he sees&nbsp;Happy emerge from window. Initially at a disadvantage, KRIMZ&nbsp;absorbs a hit before&nbsp;crouch-dodging behind cover to his right,&nbsp;squaring&nbsp;his crosshairs as he shifts to&nbsp;score a headshot onto the&nbsp;EnVyUs leader. Three kills in three seconds, and&nbsp;zero bullets in his magazine by the end of it. Fnatic would win eight of the next nine games to force overtime, win the OT (including one round with a hilarious&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESL/status/635520870358851586\">quad&nbsp;AWP</a> setup), and then win the second map, Cobblestone, comfortably at 16-7 to take the championship. Moments like this one demonstrate how much momentum plays a role in Counter-Strike. ",

        "contents": "survey fridays Every week we ask you to rank a series or just reminisce about PC games in a not-very-scientific survey.&nbsp;Look for the survey link in our&nbsp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pcgamer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pcgamermagazine\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> feeds each week, and the results every Friday. Previously, we ranked the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/ranking-the-best-and-worst-of-the-mass-effect-games/\">Mass Effect</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-call-of-duty-series-ranked/\">Call of Duty</a> series. You guys really love hard games, or at least, you love whichever game you remember as the hardest. In my latest survey, I asked respondents to rank the hardest game&nbsp;they've played on a scale of 1-10. Over 40% scored their most challenging experience a 10, and 70% scored it an 8 or higher. You also love a lot of different hard games, and have different ideas about what makes a game 'hard.' Among 2,660 respondents, the top game cited as the hardest they've ever played was only mentioned&nbsp;385 times&mdash;around&nbsp;14% of the total. (Actually,&nbsp;one person wrote in <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/71240/\" target=\"_blank\">SEGA Bass Fishing</a> 1,006 times, but I've cut that from the results, along with several variations of \"your mom.\") What's the hardest PC&nbsp;game you've played? the top 10 <em>Click the icon in the upper right to enlarge.</em> Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-review/\">Dark Souls</a> got the most mentions, with 14% saying it was the hardest game they've ever played.&nbsp;It was followed by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Souls 2</a>, which took in about 5% of the results. From there, though, the results are immediately diverse, with shooters, platformers,&nbsp;puzzle games, strategy games, and MOBAs all bunched together. When I cut out jokes, console games, games with specific caveats, and those that received only one or two mentions, I was still&nbsp;left with over 70 games. (Here's my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14orEFM3Uq_FZvXchtUKccRbtWvezkJJZJOa_ScC7LQo/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">curated list&nbsp;of the top 77</a>.) The top 10, naturally, are the <em>most popular</em> hard games&mdash;and games that are arguably&nbsp;best known for being hard&mdash;so the results actually get more interesting the deeper into the list I go. At number 11, for instance, you'll find I Wanna Be The Boshy, a fan game based on number six,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kayin.moe/iwbtg/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">I Wanna Be The Guy</a>, an intentionally difficult&nbsp;tribute to early platformers. Further down (and I'm skipping around a bit),&nbsp;we find <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/starcraft-ii/\">StarCraft II</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/stalker-call-of-pripyat/\">STALKER</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/insurgency-review/\">Insurgency</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/alien-isolation-review/\">Alien Isolation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/kerbal-space-program-review/\">Kerbal Space Program</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/an-introduction-to-touhou-project-japans-biggest-indie-series/\">Touhou series</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/\" target=\"_blank\">VVVVVV</a>, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/247240/\" target=\"_blank\">Volgarr the Viking</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/spacechem-review/\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceChem</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dustforce-review/\">Dustforce</a>, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/6800/\" target=\"_blank\">Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines</a>, and, of course, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/34900/\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Rats</a>, a notoriously awful game which has accrued a positive rating on Steam, because ironic Steam&nbsp;reviews are all the rage. It's good to see the Touhou Project's bullet-hell games earn some mentions. We recently&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/an-introduction-to-touhou-project-japans-biggest-indie-series/\">published an introduction to the series</a>, which is currently being&nbsp;<a href=\"http://playism-games.com/article/touhou-finally-coming-to-the-west\" target=\"_blank\">localized by Playism</a>. VVVVVV,&nbsp;Volgarr the Viking, Dustforce, and&nbsp;SpaceChem all come recommended (I don't think I ever made it past Vogarr's first stage, though). I did expect to see a few more puzzle games. One&nbsp;game no one mentioned, I presume because it's newer and a bit more niche, is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/\" target=\"_blank\">TIS-100</a>. It's made by the creators of SpaceChem and Infinifactory, and&nbsp;might be one of the most challenging puzzle games I've played (though it's presumably easier for experienced programmers, and anyone who paid more attention in school than I did). Print out the manual if you can. Choosing difficulty difficulty levels <em>Click the icon in the upper-right to enlarge.</em> All of the games I mentioned up there can easily be described&nbsp;as&nbsp;'hard,' if for different reasons. Against skilled opponents, CS:GO, Dota 2, League of Legends, and&nbsp;StarCraft 2&nbsp;are very&nbsp;hard, and they're complex. Dwarf Fortress and Kerbal Space Program require a lot of learning. Super Hexagon, and the bullet-hell games&nbsp;and platformers, require precision control. But plenty of games which aren't known for being hard can be very hard. The Witcher 2, for instance, came in at 19, in part due to its permadeath mode and first boss. Those damn RC missions from GTA: San Andreas also&nbsp;came up. Civilization V on Diety difficulty, too. In&nbsp;the survey,&nbsp;I asked which difficulty setting (based on four generic settings) the takers were most likely to choose when starting a new game. The distribution is about as I&nbsp;expected: almost no one takes the easy route, the most people (39.8%) leave it on the normal difficulty, and&nbsp;slightly fewer choose the&nbsp;hard (28.7%) or the hardest modes (26%). -&nbsp;Abernath <em>Thrown a banana peel out the window. But I picked it up later.</em> - Kenu <em>I once got so frustrated while just trying to get fuel up to my ship that was trying to get to Mun that I decided to fly all my rockets into Kerbol (the sun). I spent about 5 hours just designing the booster/fuel ships to help get my whole fleet there and give them the last push into its blinding embrace. Once every single one was burned to ash, and all the crew with it, I deleted the save and went to bed. It was only after I woke up that I realized what I had done. To say the least, I cried.</em> -&nbsp;Nerd__Guy &nbsp;Threw my lamp out the window. It was a damn good lamp too. - Anonymous <em>Literally ripped out a chunk of hair in frustration once.</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Nate Dogg <em>I actually broke my grandfather's trackball mouse while playing when I was a kid on his PC. I had to buy him a new mouse from Walmart. </em>- Brain <em>Threw more money at it. This is a recurring theme with me in multiplayer games.</em>&nbsp;- Ryan Daniels <em>In my grandest fit of frustration, I suppressed my volatile feelings with the warm, cheesy comfort of Hot Pockets. A lot of them. It turns out one man can eat a lot of Hot Pockets. They come out a lot faster than they go in.</em> -&nbsp;Chudbunkis <em>Threw a banana peel at the screen.</em> -&nbsp;As7iX <em>Broke a finger.</em> -&nbsp;Dodie So is Dark Souls really that hard? I predicted that Dark Souls would be the&nbsp;most popular game in the survey,&nbsp;so I added an extra question. I asked everyone, regardless of which game they put down as the hardest, to agree or disagree with the statement \"Dark Souls isn't even that hard, ugh.\" I think we can all agree that I chose an extremely unscientific way to phrase the question, but we definitely&nbsp;can't all agree on whether or not Dark Souls is hard.&nbsp; ",

The teams in competition are divided into <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/08/12280/\">four groups</a>: Group A features Team SoloMid, Ninjas in Pyjamas, Renegades, and Counter Logic Gaming; Group B contains Team EnVyUs, Luminosity Gaming, Team Kinguin, and FlipSid3 Tactics; Group C has Fnatic, Natus Vincere, Titan, and Team eBettle; and Group D boasts Virtus.Pro, mouseports, Cloud9, and Team Immunity. On Friday, the groups will be redrawn for eight more Decider/Elimination matches. Right now the favored teams are perpetual champions&nbsp;Fnatic followed by&nbsp;Team SoloMid, a team formed in February that hasn't yet won a major. ESL One Cologne is also&nbsp;interesting this year because, for the first time ever, ESL will conduct <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl-details-anti-doping-policies-for-esl-one-cologne/\">randomized drug testing</a> during the competition. The move comes in response to a claim by former Cloud9 player Kory \"Semphis\" Friesen that he and his teammates <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl-to-begin-randomized-drug-testing-at-esl-one-cologne/\">were on Adderall</a> at ESL One Katowice. The real action will begin on Saturday, with the first quarter-final match scheduled to begin at 4:45 am EDT. Semi-final matches are slated for 5:45 and 9:10 am EDT on Sunday, followed by the big finish at 1 pm EDT the same day.

Interestingly (and I won't say tellingly but we're all thinking it), the restriction on marijuana use is centered out to be somewhat more specific. \"Marijuana is on the list of prohibited substances for during the competition. This means that recreational use of it outside (before) the event days will not be punished,\" Rozwandowicz wrote. \"Using it during the tournament&mdash;from the start of the first day until the end of the last day of competition&mdash;is strictly prohibited.\" Players caught juicing will face sanctions ranging from deductions from their prize money or tournament points, to outright disqualification and a ban from ESL events for up to two years, depending on the circumstances of each individual case. In all cases, ESL said it will take steps to ensure the full privacy of all players involved. ",

        "contents": "North American CS:GO team&nbsp;Cloud9 at ESL Katowice, in March. <em>Images via&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eslphotos\"><em>ESL Flickr</em></a>. When a member of North American CS:GO team Cloud9 unapologetically <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl-preparing-new-anti-doping-rules-following-katowice-adderall-controversy/\">admitted</a> that he and his teammates used adderall during a tournament in March, esports league ESL reacted swiftly, announcing that it would enforce <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl-to-begin-randomized-drug-testing-at-esl-one-cologne/\">randomized drug testing</a> at its next event before it pursues a larger policy in partnership with two organizations dedicated to anti-doping practices. An incident with performance-enhancing drugs was inevitable for esports, which are growing <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/day9-says-esports-will-be-a-predominant-hobby-worldwide/\">more than ever</a> alongside the popularity of competitive games and livestreaming. ESL s stopgap measure of implementing random tests for ESL Cologne in August is welcome, but how will drug testing be handled going forward? How will a league like ESL react during a tournament weekend when one of its players tests positive for a banned substance? To get further clarity on the ESL s perspective on this issue I spoke with Michal Blicharz, Managing Director Pro Gaming at ESL. <strong>PCG: Why is the implementation of player drug testing necessary to the ESL?</strong> <strong>Michal Blicharz:</strong>&nbsp;We are a company with the word sports in the name. The integrity of our competitions is paramount to what we do. We have already invested enormous amounts of resources to combat online cheating with our ESL Wire Anti Cheat software and the time has come for us to do something about performance enhancing drugs. In the past 18 months the salaries of the best esports players have risen about ten fold and the prize money aggregates per game have gone into high millions. The temptation is there for players more so than ever and it s on us to educate gamers, preserve the integrity of our competitions and, if necessary, punish those who break the rules. \"The reaction from the video games and esports industry has been overwhelmingly positive.\" <strong>Do you believe that other leagues will follow your example?</strong> <strong>Blicharz:</strong> What other leagues do is really up to them. We are of course willing to share our experiences and best practices if they reach out for help. <strong>Is there currently, or are you planning, any retroactive investigation into teams' activities?</strong> <strong>Blicharz:</strong> We have considered it, but we do not think that it is realistic for us to gather enough conclusive proof retrospectively. We are currently focusing our efforts on establishing good procedures for future events. <strong>Has the ESL spoken directly with Cloud9 about the admission that its players used adderall during ESL Katowice?</strong> <strong>Blicharz: </strong>When we first heard about this issue, we focused our energy on what we can do moving forward. This is not to say that we are indifferent to what may or may not have happened in that specific case, but it was clear that a more urgent need was to find real ways to prevent those situations from happening in the future. As for the player himself, or his team, we are unable to retrospectively test the team for PEDs, therefore any investigation would likely prove to be inconclusive. <strong>How has the new policy been received by teams?</strong> <strong>Blicharz:</strong> The reaction from the video games and esports industry has been overwhelmingly positive. At the core of it, teams are interested in being provided a fair playing field. It's also on the teams to make sure gaming is clean and I hope they will actively play their role as well. <strong>If a player is prescribed adderall, or another drug, by a doctor, would they be permitted to use it during an ESL competition?</strong> <strong>Blicharz:</strong> We are currently consulting with NADA on how to handle it and to learn what the best practices are that we can apply to what we do. We certainly do not want to disqualify players who have legitimate medical conditions. <strong>Section 2.13.3 of the current <a href=\"http://www.esl-one.com/csgo/katowice-2015/tournament-rules/\">ESL rulebook</a> reads, \"If a participant gets disqualified from the ESL One during an ongoing stage, all it's members get banned until the end of main event.\" If a player tests positive for a banned substance at an ESL event, what will happen?</strong> <strong>Blicharz: </strong>Our league operations and legal teams are working on updating the rules, and the exact terms of all sanctions are yet to be determined. We want to treat doping like any other form of cheating. This is something our Director of League Operations should speak to, but we will very likely punish illegal doping the same way we would punish cheating in a match. In essence, those things are not different from each other as far as the integrity of the competition is concerned. <strong>Along with incidents like the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\">betting scandal</a> in Counter-Strike earlier this year, do you believe there's a need for the CS scene, or esports in general, to become more mature?</strong> <strong>Blicharz:</strong> Of course esports has to mature. It's not even 20 years old! At the same time, in many ways it's outgrown some sports that have been around almost a century. It takes time but we will get there. <strong>Thanks for speaking with us, Michal.</strong> ",

Today, Steam adds at least that many games each month and a half&mdash;55 each week, on average, or almost <em>eight per day</em>. There s no question that Steam is saturated. Steam grew by 561 games in 2013, but added 1,814 <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/steam-has-released-more-games-so-far-this-year-than-all-of-2013/\">in 2014</a>. Seven months into 2015, there s already 1,592 new games on Steam. But is that truly a problem? Steam s library is growing at the fastest rate in its 12-year history, and those of us who play and write about PC games full-time will never dig more than a spoon into Steam s mountain range of more than 5,600 games. It s certainly tempting, even natural, to label that as a problem. Last year, there was a wave of concern following <a href=\"http://gamasutra.com/view/news/217675/More_games_have_released_on_Steam_so_far_in_2014_than_all_of_last_year.php\">a Gamasutra post</a> that visualized the volume of new games hitting Steam. <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/there-are-too-many-new-games-on-steam-1577173890\">Kotaku</a> wrote that the trend was hurting developers and gamers. Spiderweb Software s Jeff Vogel told of the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/spiderweb-softwares-jeff-vogel-claims-indie-bubble-is-popping/\">imminent burst</a> of the indie bubble, and <a href=\"http://www.develop-online.net/analysis/has-the-indie-bubble-burst-on-pc/0193441\">others jumped up</a> from their chairs to agree: there are too many games on Steam. Seven months into 2015, there s already 1,592 new games on Steam. Those who point at the perpetual logjam of new releases feel that Valve has abandoned any semblance of quality control. They fear that Steam will become like the App Store, known more for what it rejects than what it showcases. And they have a point: who wants lazy <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/350610/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_8\">mobile game ports</a>, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/373810/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_10\">halfheartedly erotic pinball</a>, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/356510/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_16\">soccer-fighting games</a>, something called <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/380580/\">SpaceCorn</a>, or <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/365020/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_17\">Gynophobia</a>, a horror shooter about abnormal fear of women, on Steam? How can deserving, independent gems to stand out in an ecosystem filled with junk? And when games do break through, how can developers retain interest long enough to build a healthy community? The most irrationally paranoid thought is that we re inching toward the PC gaming equivalent of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983\">video game crash of 83</a>, when the level of saturation of games and platforms gutted the industry, forcing many hardware-makers and publishers to collapse or withdraw forever. Consider this prescient quote from 1986 by Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo s president: Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third-party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games. How small studios feel about Steam Whatever your reaction to this trend, the people whose lives are most braided to it are independent developers and publishers. And when I reached out to them to talk about Steam, I was surprised that the majority of them are unfazed by how crowded Valve s platform has become. To Swen Vincke, CEO at Larian Studios, today s Steam is simply a return to the way things were before digital distribution, but not in a bad way. Access to retail used to determine which games we got to play, something that hampered the evolution of videogames, says Vincke, who believes digital distribution has created a true renaissance in the industry. However, the quantity of games being released now means that the new barrier to entry has become discoverability, and as a developer you need to plan from day one how your target audience will find out about your game, and ensure that your game has more reasons to be played by players than a similar game your competitor may be making. Which, if you think about it, is exactly how it s always been. There are just more competitors now, so there s no room for slacking. That s a good thing, too, in my opinion. Paradox Interactive has grown in parallel with Steam over the past several years. They ve become a more diverse publisher in that time, having a hand in Pillars of Eternity this year as well as Cities: Skylines and stuff like Magicka. Despite this, you d expect Paradox to be exactly the sort of entity that s sensitive to a crowded market. Games like Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis&mdash;heritage franchises for Paradox&mdash;rely on word of mouth, on player anecdotes, to spread their reputations, capture attention, and grow. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-review/\">Rocket League</a> and ARK: Survival Evolved are recent hits on Steam. But Susana Meza Graham, COO at Paradox, mostly shrugs off Steam s open-doors policy. Yes, on any given day, there are a lot of games being released. And of course visibility is a challenge for developers, just like navigating the content is a challenge for consumers, says Meza Graham. But the challenge of visibility has always been there for us in one way or another. During the years of retail the survival of your business depended on your ability to get shelf space. And shelf space was dictated based on pedigree and previous releases, your marketing budgets and your ability to commit to a release date six months to one year in advance. Like Vincke, Meza Graham sees Steam as more of a blessing than a burden to discoverability. Digital distribution, she says, has completely changed how games are developed and brought to market overall, mainly because the people playing the games are much closer to the process from start to finish, and games are developed and supported over a longer period of time after release. That, more than the volume of games releasing, has impacted the way we work with our projects. Room for everyone The smaller studios I spoke to mostly echoed these sentiments: sure, Steam is crowded, but that doesn t mean PC gaming will become a zero-sum, winner-take-all marketplace. We definitely feel a lot of pressure but we also fundamentally trust the PC audience, says Paul Kilduff-Taylor from <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mode7games\">Mode 7</a>, who released <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/frozen-cortex-review/\">Frozen Cortex</a> in February. There's a big group of gamers who want novel-but-intelligent games with a lot of depth and that's what we aspire to make; we'll continue trying to do that at whatever scale is viable in the future because it's what we love doing. I also spoke with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasavin\">Greg Kasavin</a>, a veteran of the industry who made the transition to game development after working at GameSpot for 10 years. I'm happy that we live in a time when games are more accessible than at any point in the past, both for audiences and for creators, says Kasavin. For creators this state brings some new challenges of having to gain visibility in an increasingly crowded market, but that set of problems I think is far, far preferable to the alternative where only a handful of people in the world are able to develop and publish games. Kasavin says that Supergiant Games approach to making games hasn t changed. I think we've seen similar growth and challenges in other media industries, and in the end I think it's what's best for the medium, even if it's inconvenient for some individual content creators who might personally benefit more if they didn't have as much competition. We have to differentiate ourselves in a way that hopefully doesn't derail our process but still makes us visible and provides value to fans. Daniel Jacobsen, studio director of Gaslamp Games (<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/clockwork-empires-hands-on-life-and-death-on-the-frontier/\">Clockwork Empires</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dungeons-of-dredmor/\">Dungeons of Dredmor</a>) mostly&nbsp;agrees with his peers, but believes that business awareness has greater value today than it did in the past. There s more emphasis on PR and advertising across most non-AAA studios, says Jacobsen. The major change for us is that now we can't just have a game that people want to play. For the best chance at success we have to be a game company that people want to support which is making games that people want to play. We have to differentiate ourselves in a way that hopefully doesn't derail our process but still makes us visible and provides value to fans. Of the feedback I received from developers, Dave Marsh, co-founder of Zojoi, expressed the most concern. As an indie studio, we re big fans of giving any developer the chance to publish their games in the largest marketplace on the web, says Marsh. While we have received solid support from our publisher and Valve, the sheer number of titles (and sales) available drives down the price players are willing to pay, hurting our ability to make the kind of games our fans love for the PC market. Thus we are forced to consistently offer <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/294440/\">Shadowgate</a> at significant discounts, putting us in a precarious position: change our development model, find additional funding, look at other platforms, or leave the market altogether. Marsh s comments recall <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/steam-deals-dont-cannibalise-sales-says-valves-director-of-business-management/\">a debate in 2012</a>, when concern was raised that the high frequency of Steam sales would diminish the value of PC games overall. The approach for us is the same I also spoke to two major indie PR representatives, the people working every day to rise above the surface of Steam s churning, ever-rising sea of games. Like Jacobsen, both of them underline the need to stand out, but neither mark Steam itself as the problem. So many games launching weekly dramatically increases the need for a well thought-out communication strategy&mdash;getting lost in the noise is more of threat than ever, says Stephanie Tinsley Fitzwilliam of Tinsley-PR, who over the years has worked with Stardock Entertainment, Devolver Digital, Piranha Games, Deep Silver, and others. Evolve PR, like Tinsley-PR, represents a spectrum of independent game makers. The company s founder, Tom Ohle, doesn t seem to flinch at the volume of new stuff hitting Steam each day. There is definitely a lot more noise out there, but fundamentally the approach for us is the same: figure out the appropriate audience for a game and then try to reach that audience, says Ohle. This all just puts even greater pressure on developers to really stand out, to make games that offer <em>something</em> unique. Whether it's visual style, game mechanics or narrative themes, developers have to make their games different in some way from competitive offerings. Even then it's no guarantee that the game will succeed or get attention. You're still relying on media and content creators&mdash;already overloaded by the number of requests they're getting&mdash;to actually open emails or read a tweet or whatever... and considering we get about 25 to 40 percent open rates on our emails, you're always fighting a bit of an uphill battle. Steam isn't an&nbsp;obstacle Most of us, less than a decade ago, were buying our PC games in boxes. And independent developers, in order to get their games on those physical shelves, had to deal with a number of middlemen: distributors, publishers, disc manufacturers and printers, and the retailers who would ultimately decide how many copies of a game deserved to be on display. Steam leveled the playing field on PC. And getting in early was a boon to games like Garry s Mod, Killing Floor, Peggle, and Audiosurf, when the ratio of tens of millions of users to only hundreds of games assured a disproportionate amount of promotion. But Steam stopped being a platform that guarantees some level of success and exposure years ago. Today Steam is, for the most part, the playing field&mdash;a massive shelf of 5,600 titles where everyone gets, for the most part, equal prominence. But when we say that Steam now has a discoverability problem, the laziest possible criticism that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ELahti/status/514656178744217601\">I myself</a> have been guilty of parroting, we fail to examine how the entire landscape of digital communication has shifted to promote discovery, more than compensating for whatever comparatively trivial changes in policy Valve has made in the past couple years. Millions of people now operate massive engines that promote discovery: YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Twitch, websites like ours&mdash;all resources that didn t exist in anywhere near the same form even three or four years ago. Livestreaming was universally a hassle as recently as 2011; now it s a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-stream-on-twitch/\">one-button proposition</a> through utilities like ShadowPlay and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-set-up-open-broadcaster-a-free-lightweight-livestreaming-application/\">OBS</a>. This is the new normal. Valve s policies have made Steam something of an open port&mdash;the digital equivalent of Ellis Island. But Steam itself isn t a problem, it s merely a reflection of the larger, exciting state of PC gaming, the intersection of game development tools being more accessible than ever, engine licensing in particular becoming cheaper (<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/unreal-engine-4-is-now-free/\">or free</a>), and the greatest level of evangelism and grassroots promotion of PC gaming since 1999. Steam isn t where developers compete&mdash;they compete in the much larger ecosystem of communities and systems of sharing that constitutes PC gaming. ",

Last year's&nbsp; <a href=\"http://open.dreamhack.se/page/valencia/\">DreamHack Valencia</a> was more of a second-tier tournament in CS:GO, featuring many outdated lineups such as k1ck and the old HellRaisers (and an all French grand-final that amusingly featured two players with current VAC bans, Sf and KQLY). But this year s DreamHack received some pep in its step by integrating with <a href=\"https://play.faceit.com/\">FACEIT</a>, buffing the prize-pool and bringing elite teams who would theoretically qualify from three regions: Europe, North America, and Oceania. The event saw a flurry of stories determine its odd composition, with an Oceanic regional contender missing from the party due to both qualified teams (Renegades and Immunity) having to focus on the ESL One Cologne Asian qualifier running concurrently in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. With the dust settled from the event, and with Danish TSM bearing home a trophy and check for $40,000, let s reflect on the FACEIT 2015 Stage 2 finals at DreamHack Valencia. Takeaway #1: Liquid have a long way to travel Let s first focus on the all-American Liquid team, whose latest offline results heading in the tournament saw them take a map apiece off of elite teams Fnatic and Na`Vi at Gfinity Spring Masters II, as well make their continental rivals Cloud9 sweat in the quarter-finals of ESWC 2015, despite ultimately losing. Expectations among the Liquid camp were not particularly high going into Valencia, considering the team s hapless group draw alongside Fnatic, TSM, and NiP. And despite no major blowouts, Liquid went down 9-16 in the opening match to Fnatic and then lost in their best-of-three to NiP the next day. The fact of the matter is that the team requires fraggers nitr0 and EliGE to be heavily present, as well as fundamental support play from flowsicK and FugLy, and some form of this overall cohesion was missing in Valencia. The takeaway for Liquid from this series will be that the team needs to hit the drawing board, draw on its recent international tournament experiences, and practice set-ups and timings until they can compete at the highest level. Takeaway #2: An ode to the old Virtus.pro Despite some tournament wins in 2015, and a deep playoff run at this year s so-far only major in their home country, Virtus.pro is a shell of its old former self. Although the team continues to perform well online&mdash;a fact that is highly ironic considering that the team s core of NEO, TaZ, and pashaBiceps were notorious in CS 1.6 for poor online placings&mdash;which allows them to qualify and attend events, deep playoff runs seem less and less likely as time goes on. This team is one of the most travelled in 2015, and with a median age for its players being higher than many teams , are thus particularly susceptible to event fatigue. No wonder then that no successful combination of players has been able to show up in its recent matches, and even the game-sense genius that is Snax is subdued as of late. The opening game against Na`Vi was in Virtus.pro s favour until sloppy play on the Poles side cost them the opener. The next day s best-of-three group decider against Kinguin at first appeared to be a breeze, but a resurgent Kinguin squad bounced back after map one and took de_dust2 away from VP to force a third map. And from there, legends tell that a third map was never played. Or, a third map could not have possibly been played considering the savage dismantlement that went down on de_cache. Virtus.pro stood up from their computers with a 0-16 drubbing on the books. The story here is similar to Liquid s case, although in a different ultimate direction. Both teams will have to look to the future, however Virtus.pro s road looks to be a downhill slope as of now. Virtus.pro stood up from their computers with a 0-16 drubbing on the books. Takeaway #3: Kinguin Kings The replacement of one Swede for another, dennis for SKYTTEN, seems to have had immediate effect in the Scandinavian-Belgian-Portuguese superstar team that is Kinguin. Although the team s upset victory over Virtus.pro has been mentioned, the team even managed to take de_inferno off of Na`Vi in the Group A decider match (despite ultimately losing 2-1). The tale of Kinguin is one of infinite promise, as well as delivery on all the past months previous hype. The revelation that dalito is both IGL and coach behind the team (whereas other CS:GO team s coaches are sometimes seen sulkily prowling behind the team with not much real input) is no doubt one piece in the puzzle of the team s impressive showing at the FACEIT Stage 2 finals. However, one cannot simply discount the insane fragging ability of ScreaM, Maikelele, rain, and fox, and as the team s cohesion (and English language proficiency) improves&mdash;barring any hiccups&mdash;Kinguin will be a legitimate contender in any tournament format. Takeaway #4: NiP An enigma There is no question of the Ninjas in Pyjamas experiencing a fall from grace in 2015. With one title under their belt (ASUS ROG Winter) this year, as well as yet another finals placing at a major, the team survived off what little fuel in its tank remained to ride out a few events up until midsummer. Yet recent events (despite breaks for NiP) have not been so rosy, with the team s crash-and-burn in the quarter-finals against a Hiko-powered FlipSid3 being particularly brutal. Thankfully, this past weekend saw a much stronger NiP fall in the Group A decider match against an admittedly worthy opponent of Fnatic, with NiP losing both maps 14-16. There was much to be seen that was comforting: f0rest playing well, Finnish sniper allu having an impact, and GeT_RiGhT still displaying dedication and talent at a high level. However, the team still lack depth to their strategies and executes and one previously monstrous player has gone rather mute: friberg. In a season where many entry-fraggers struggle (more on that in Cloud9), friberg s poor statistics can be chalked up to a changed metagame yet there is still truth in the fact that the star of ESL One Cologne 2014 has taken a dip in his performance. Takeaway #5: The rise of Na`Vi Na`Vi can be arguably classified as part of the new trifecta of elite teams, with the other two being Fnatic and TSM. After fiddling around with variations of lineups for nearly two years, and always bringing tantalisingly close results bar a gold medal, the 2015 Na`Vi lineup with flamie and seized is a surefire winning one. The rise of Na`Vi began with the team s victory at ESL PL Winter, continued with their win at StarSeries XIII, and was cemented with the team s closely fought victory over Cloud9 at ESWC. Despite a tendency to occasionally throw away comfortable leads&mdash;as well as a healthy grouping of fiery tempers on the team&mdash;Na`Vi continue to deliver high class strategy and play in CS:GO. At DreamHack Valencia, the Na`Vi lineup looked a little shaky however this Russo-Ukrainian-Slovakian team were still able to make a deep playoff run and take a map off champions TSM in the semifinals. GuardiaN may be perhaps the most consistent player in terms of statistics that the game has yet to see (the only other contender who comes to mind is Fnatic star olofmeister) and he finds ample help from fragging duo Edward and seized when necessary. The final cog in the Na`Vi machine was flamie and it was the Russian s exceptional clutch plays and solid holds that turned Na`Vi from a tier-two team into a tier-one team. However, at the FACEIT finals, flamie was notably absent, even going 34-51 in the semi-finals against TSM. Na`Vi will need all the firepower it can get if it wants to rack up more gold. Takeaway #6: Full-on Fnatic Has the world s current top team taken a dive? All five players on Fnatic are still capable of peaks of CS:GO greatness and if Fnatic s decider match victory against NiP is any indication, the team still function on a focused and disciplined level. However, it can be argued that Fnatic have found a kryptonite in two teams (although it remains to be seen if the reason is merely the effect of being at the top and having all teams gun for the top dog), which are TSM and Cloud9. The former team makes sense, as the elite Danish squad is Fnatic s near rival in terms of teamwork, raw skill, and map precise play. A best-of-one series is always up in the air in this case, and depends on which players are ready to go out of their minds with insane plays. Cloud9 however, are a bit of a surprise, and a pleasant one at that. The charismatic American team (sporting one Canadian in the form of shroud) took Fnatic to the wire on multiple maps (as well as winning one) at the $500,000 finals of the ESL ESEA Pro League. This resiliency against Swedish skill returned in the semi-finals this weekend when Cloud9 trounced Fnatic 2-0, including in an overtime thriller on de_train, a map which is quickly becoming a point of contention for these two teams. Fnatic seem to have no issue yet, although two players previously known for deep game-impact, JW and flusha, can be seen to go under at times. KRIMZ, once the most complete CS:GO player, is also more subdued as of late. Yet with olofmeister still turning most team s defenders into Swiss cheese on his T sides, Fnatic are still up there among the very best, locked in a slightly disadvantageous struggle with TSM. Takeaway #7: No time like now for North America Cloud9 survived the turbulent NA Shuffle and resurrected with a significantly buffed roster. Three grand final finishes in three weekends is no small joke in a scene as diverse and vibrant as the CS:GO one, and if entry-fragger and recent retiree fREAKAZOiD can pick up on a few more frags, then this team will have no discernible weakness for the most part. Communication issues have been smoothed out (at least as past weekends POV s have demonstrated) and the team looked even more in sync in Valencia. Skadoodle is making a viable campaign for the best AWPer in the game (although GuardiaN and KennyS would still like a word) and shroud is finally playing a comfortable and consistent carry role. The CEVO finals may just be Cloud9 s chance to do North America a favour and finally bring home the 1st place finish, assuming the team can surmount regional rivals, Na`Vi, and Virtus.pro (with the final team being a particular thorn for Cloud9). Takeaway #8: The era of TSM TSM successfully defended their FACEIT 2015 League trophy and took another first place finish into the vault. The team have been stable with no real roster changes in 2015 and karrigan s role as an IGL is now indisputably better than that of old leader, FeTiSh. Despite a streaky event attendance record (which should be solved now that the team have survived Danish exams season) and the unfortunate best-of-one blunders that led TSM to finish dead last at ESL ESEA Season 1 finals, TSM are still definitely the second-best, if not the best team in the world. Proof is in the pudding, and the TSM pudding is preferably served with a dose of Danish <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2012/01/30/146080892/winter-doldrums-got-you-down-have-some-hygge\"><em>hygge</em></a>, which one experiences when watching the team play pitch-perfect Counter-Strike. It s frightening how coordinated the team can be at times, and with previous choke issues appearing less and less frequently, this is the team to watch for the second half of 2015. The FACEIT League 2015 Stage 2 finals at DreamHack Valencia saw eight teams enter and one emerge victorious. Truly, no team finished in what might be called a static and stable result for said team, and each team is currently expectant of a better future or dejectedly watching its performances suffer. Such is the state of current CS:GO in a way, and the flux and volatility in itself are things well-worth watching for those who don t even play the game. ",

TRIGGERNOMETRY We write about FPSes each week in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/triggernometry\" target=\"_blank\">Triggernometry</a>, a mixture of tips, esports,&nbsp;and a celebration of virtual marksmanship. Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP) are the royalty of CS:GO. Four of the five active members were the core of the lineup which went 87 straight maps before losing offline. The dynasty that won its first 10 offline tournaments. The legends that placed top four in their first 31 tournaments. Even since then, they have continued a legacy of top placings, having made the final of all five CS:GO majors, winning&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-highlights-from-csgos-esl-one-cologne-2014-tournament/\">ESL One Cologne</a> in August of last year. Still, they are a special team, which comes up with magic in big matches. Yet this is not an NiP that is the best team in the world or close to it. Problems in the pyjama province It is still routine for NiP to place top four, practically, but the days of GeT_RiGhT and company taking home trophies seem so far away. In 2014, with their classic lineup, they won three big titles. In 2015, they have failed to win a single big trophy in eight attempts, thusfar. NiP are still a special lineup, capable of playing the majority of the top teams closely when everything comes together. The primary problems for NiP are that they still tend to lose those nail-biters against the elite teams and that the dangerous landscape of the top end of the competition scene means they typically need to beat two strong teams in series to win a trophy. In short, even NiP's best is currently not enough to take a title from a&nbsp;FNATIC, TSM or EnVyUs, the teams they're most likely to&nbsp;face in a final. f0rest Waning personnel power The only questions asked of the old lineup were of support player fifflaren's play, since he was often the statistical sore thumb standing out among players who were all close to the best at their positions. The players who replaced him, in particular the explosive but erratic AWPer Maikelele, found that scrutiny transferred to them. The arrival of allu, the consistent and efficient Finnish sniper, has shown us, however, that NiP's problems no longer lie with the fifth man. Allu has been a model of regularly excellent performance, leaving us to look at the other four and ask who is failing to deliver a championship performance in their role. Shockingly, the first place one must consider is with one of the stars, as aim master f0rest, still one of the world's best pistol players, has routinely stumbled in big games and found himself lacking a star level impact on his team's fortunes. With allu and GeT_RiGhT both posting good&nbsp;numbers,&nbsp;the third star has been very much waning in the last few months. Beyond f0rest, issues can be observed with both former in-game leader Xizt and friberg. The former has been slumping for at least the last few months, though he does still win some memorable clutch rounds, and the latter just had possibly the worst tournament of his career with NiP's group stage elimination at Gfinity Spring Masters II. Xizt Trying everything NiP have been aware their results are not up to par and attempted numerous changes. They switched up some of their most famous CT postions on maps. They've brought in former 3DMAX player and CS veteran natu as their new coach. Finally, they've even shifted the in-game leadership role to lurker GeT_RiGhT. So far, each change has had mixed results, often working somewhat early on and then leveling back off to a similar effect later. Unless big results come, one cannot help but feel that Xizt will return to holding the reigns, much as the Ninjas did revert some of their positional changes. The future of the dynasty This NiP does not look like the team of old in as much as it does not look capable of holding the number one spot in the rankings. With the right draw and collection of individual performances, they can still win a trophy or two, but even that will take some momentous fortune and is far from guaranteed. For NiP, this is the period in which they learn if they can live with being a top team but not the best. If FNATIC are not at the top, surely it will be TSM. If not TSM, then EnVyUs may rise again. The only thing which seems certain, is that NiP's time has passed, at least with this legendary core.

To witness greatness in real-time is a rare gift. From Michael Jordan's second three-peat run with the Bulls to Gretzky's titles with the Oilers, many wish they could be transported back to see such feats unfold in their moment of taking place. The greatest lineup in CS:GO history may very well be the current&nbsp;FNATIC lineup, and it's&nbsp;far from done yet. This five man FNATIC squad, completed late last June, has amassed a record which gives them a legitimate claim to the throne of the great Ninjas in Pyjamas, which seemed impossible to even approach. FNATIC has won 10 offline titles, made 13 finals and reached the top four in&nbsp;17 out of 18 tournaments. Teams like LDLC (now EnVyUs) and TSM have had their moments, the latter perhaps still on-going, where they appeared to be the best team in the world, but the FNATIC train keeps rolling along and consistently gets deep in tournaments and then out-paces its rivals by being better against the field. The personnel to dominate The easy way to describe a historically dominant line-up like this would be to say that they're&nbsp;simply 'too good,' but in a sense that's&nbsp;accurate. FNATIC's success has come first and foremost as a result of having a line-up which is too good in terms of talent and the roles they can perform at a world class level in. In the early days of their initial run of dominance, beginning in October, they were led by the impeccable fundamentals of KRiMZ, locking down bombsites entirely and helping define a meta of CT-side dominance, which would sweep the entire top end of the CS:GO scene. The sidekick at that time was JW, the impossible-to-predict and supremely explosive AWPer/rifler hybrid. With KRiMZ's providing a solid backbone to the team and the others being excellent team-players, JW was freed up to be the ultimate wild-card player, going where he pleased and finding the right moments from which to explode into opposing teams. While those two have had their moments and tournaments since, the new star of the team has been olofmeister, whose skill level is ridiculous. Olof&nbsp;is an all-around package player the likes of which has probably&nbsp;never been seen before in CS:GO, as he is one of the world's elite riflers and yet can also AWP as well as almost every primary sniper in the game. Spurred on by olof's individual peak, FNATIC have been able to supplement his play with much-improved form by Flusha, the man whose dip in form late last year and early into this year partially accounted for FNATIC's brief drop-off. Flusha is not just the reliable clutch round player he built his career upon being but has recently also been topping scoreboards and even bringing some sniping into his game, successfully. FNATIC take the cliche \"embarrassment of riches\" and make it seem only apt to describe the luxuries they possess in terms of players. Take any other top five side in CS:GO and switch around which players will carry the team and you'll likely find yourself with a significantly worse team, while FNATIC are again winning titles and reaching finals again and again, even winning their major in the post-KRiMZ era. Gods of Inferno In two of FNATIC's early big international offline competitions they found key losses on inferno contributing to their elimination. That map would become both the home ground for FNATIC in the coming months and one of the most dominant maps of any team in the game's history. A team mastering a specific map&nbsp;is&nbsp;an often overlooked aspect of dominance. Ideally, it should be one that other elite teams play, ensuring it won't be banned, and then forces respect bans from lesser teams, opening the map pool even more for the dominant team. FNATIC's Inferno is the perfect example of such a scenario in CS:GO. FNATIC have lost less than 10 times offline on inferno with this lineup, despite having played it at least&nbsp;32 times. This was the map which both put all of the FNATIC players in their ideal positions, but also took advantage of&nbsp;the massively CT-sided meta of late 2014. Today, FNATIC still maintain their dominance in the map, despite the meta having shifted and teams racking up many more T-side rounds in a time when the Tec-9 is particularly strong. Still going While the great NiP lineup is long gone and they seek to establish a new championship team, FNATIC is still very much in the flow of their run of greatness. Winning their last two events and having made the final of four of their last five offline events, FNATIC are still the best team in the world and the best against the overall field of teams. Their last title came after a brutal 3:0 victory over Virtus.pro, a great CS:GO line-up in their own right, in the final of Gfinity Spring Masters II. FNATIC have more in the tank, so tune into their greatness at an upcoming CS:GO tournament. ",

When I launch CS:GO and my eyes wander over my ever-growing pile of Hours Played, a thought often eats away at me. <em>I ve put hundreds of hours into Terrorisming and Counter-Terrorisming&mdash;thousands if you include Source and 1.6. I spend more time playing CS:GO than I do interacting with my loved ones. How the hell am I not a Counter-Strike master yet?</em> The truth is that getting better at Counter-Strike by only playing Counter-Strike can be a really slow, ineffective way to get better at Counter-Strike. Especially if you aren t taking the time to watch and analyze your own matches, it s possible to spend months or years making the same mistakes. Fundamental parts of Counter-Strike are opaque. Which surfaces can and can t be penetrated, and by which weapons?&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-flashbang-cs-go-guide/\">How do flashes work?</a> Can a player that loses the first two rounds of a match afford an AWP? You have to be willing to do some homework and take in raw facts about the game, information that drives deeper realizations about how it can be played. For me, that learning has opened up a better appreciation of CS. When I embraced it a long time ago, the game went from being about motor skills to being a chess match about money and clock management, scouting, feints, morale, reading audio cues, and play calling. That said, there s an infinite amount of information you can lay eyes on to study. Below, I ve gathered a set of recommended videos for players who want to gain&nbsp;the confidence to play competitively or get over some of their existing matchmaking hurdles. Rifle spray patterns, techniques Rifles are the bread and butter of Counter-Strike at all levels, and understanding how they work (and their key differences) is equivalent to a basketball player working on their free-throws. CS:GO pro adreN is really direct in his advice ( Never crouch, it has no effect on your recoil ; You should never start off with a spray at this range ) and talks about how to manage shooting while moving. Money management The second of three videos in a series about CS:GO s economy, TheWarOwl digs into the mentality around buying and saving in CS in the early stages of a match, when adhering to certain guidelines is especially important. I like the way he compares the practice of predicting your opponent s economy to counting cards in blackjack. Chokepoint timings Counter-Strike is carefully tuned so that CTs and Ts have to rush out of their spawn points in order to establish map control. Playing with the timings (by, say, throwing a grenade at a certain spot to stop a rush) at these meeting points between is central to succeeding at CS. Mouse sensitivity The advice I give to everyone is to make your sensitivity as low as possible while still being able to turn 180 degrees consistently. Flashbangs For my money, flashbangs are the least-practiced, most misunderstood aspect of CS. So many players simply go through the motions of buying and carelessly throwing flashbangs without knowing whether (or how) effective they are against an opponent. My video from earlier this year touches on two basic techniques for flashbanging and breaks down the geometric rules that determine whether someone gets blinded by one. ",

It s become one of our tiny traditions (along with Chris <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/reign-of-kings-diary-i-bashed-my-face-with-a-rock-i-kept-in-my-butt/\">questionable behavior in survival games</a>). Mostly it s an excuse for us to publish something entirely detached from reality before we fly to Los Angeles and publish every scrap of gaming news and opinion that our bodies will allow. It s therapeutic to daydream about Gabe Newell materializing atop a unicorn through a fog of theater-grade dry ice to announce Half-Life 3. We get valuable stories, videos, and interviews out of E3&mdash;you can imagine how handy it is to have almost every game-maker gathered under one roof for a few days. But it s no secret that the PC doesn t have a formal, organized presence during E3. Generally speaking it s the time of year when Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo jostle for position about who can create the most buzz. Despite being a mostly exciting few days of announcements, E3 has never given the biggest gaming platform in the world an equal place at the table. That s our collective fault, not E3 s. One of our hobby s greatest strengths is the fact that there isn t a single owner. The PC has no marketing arm, no legal department, no CEO to dictate what should be announced or advertised. And thank Zeus for that. The fundamentally open nature of our hobby is what allows for GOG, Origin, Steam, and others to compete for our benefit, for the variety of technologies and experiences we have access to&mdash;everything from netbook gaming to 8K flight simulation to VR. Everyone involved in PC gaming has shared ownership over its identity. One of the few downsides of that, though, is that there isn t really a single time and place for PC gaming to get together and hang out. We love BlizzCon, QuakeCon, DreamHack, Extra Life, The International, and the ever-increasing number of PAXes. But there s something special about the pageantry of E3 week, its over-the-top showmanship, its surprises, its proximity to Hollywood. And each June, even as we ve jokingly <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-e3-2012-press-conference-pc-gamers-deserve/\">painted a picture of PC game developers locking arms in a musical number</a>, we ve wanted something wholly by, for, and about PC gaming. Well, hell,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-and-pc-gamer-bring-the-pc-gaming-show-to-e3/\">let s do it</a>. For the past few months we ve been organizing the first ever live event for PC gaming during E3, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamingshow.com/\">The PC Gaming Show</a>. Tune into our <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/pcgamer\">Twitch</a> channel on Tuesday, June 16 on 5 PM and you ll see a spectrum of PC gaming represented on stage: a showcase of conversations, announcements, hardware, trailers, and other stuff that makes PC gaming great. We ve been talking to everyone we know, big and small&mdash;if there s a game or developer you want to see&mdash;tell us! So far, Blizzard, AMD, Bohemia Interactive, Boss Key Productions, Paradox, Dean Hall, Tripwire, and more have signed up to be a part of this inaugural PC gaming potluck (Paradox has promised to bring nachos), and we ll be announcing more participants as we lead up to June 16. And hey, the endlessly friendly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/day9tv\">Day</a> is hosting. We love that guy. We re sincerely, stupidly excited about this. The PC gaming renaissance we re all living in deserves a moment of recognition during the biggest gaming expo of the year&mdash;it s about time! Listen in on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pcgamer\">Twitter</a> and on <a href=\"http://facebook.com/pcgamermagazine\">our Facebook page</a> as we share more details leading up to June. ",

        "contents": "<em>Shawn </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FMPONE\"><em>FMPONE</em></a><em> Snelling is a modder and mapmaker for CS:GO. His work on CS:GO includes de_cache, de_crown, and the recent de_season remake. Shawn s currently working on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2u2xfa/hey_guys_its_fmpone_i_shared_the_first/\">de_santorini</a></em><em>.</em> First things first: for me, this isn t about taking sides . I like Valve. And as for the community, well, I m part of that. I m a modder, and I deserve compensation. Or, to be exact, I deserve the option to ask for compensation if I feel that s reasonable. Let s talk about what that looks like for a second. Is it 25% of a sale on a Steam item? Should Valve and Bethesda get 30% and 45% respectively of any item I sell? Actually, I m not sure. If I m selling one trillion units, I m not minding that cut really. If I m selling six units and I m eating ramen noodles under a bridge somewhere in Detroit, I m minding that cut a lot. Steam is a huge platform, and when Valve promotes your stuff as a modder, you re in the territory of making huge money. Huge money, for doing what you love. You can t really get that elsewhere, and that s a credit to Valve and how great Steam generally is and has been. So that cut, I m not sure I mind it as much as you might think. But let s go ahead and agree Valve needed to put more thought into their plan, or at least into explaining and executing their plan. There are real considerations here that just don t feel like they were addressed at all (did you know that some Skyrim mods can completely break your game?) Here s my real question: just how effective is this system going to be at rewarding modders? Well, if everyone is pissed off at Valve and refusing to purchase stuff, not very; in that situation, modders won t get paid. <em>The&nbsp;de_season remake, one of FMPONE's recent projects.</em> So let s talk a little bit about this, shall we? Let s agree that modders deserve to get paid. That s right, I said it. Those people who put their time and effort into something that provides you with countless hours of entertainment. Let s start the discussion right there&mdash;those people deserve to get paid. But only if they dig the idea. This is the trajectory of most mods historically: a small team of people works very hard to make something they feel is special and unique, and very often it is. Many of them have no interest in professional game development. Many do, and their mods serve as their resume when they look for a job in the industry. These hardworking individuals have an intense and productive relationship with the community, only to be shuffled off and placed into cubicles where their artistic voice is diluted and stifled churning out sequels for giant publishers. Instead of earning money doing what they love, they re earning money so that they can someday do what they love once again. Compensating modders is one potential answer to this thoroughly broken dynamic producing lousy games for all of us. People immediately identified serious and troubling issues with Skryim s paid-modding plan. Speaking personally, the Steam Workshop has gotten to a point where it s netting me a real salary and I feel rewarded and compensated for my work. I love what I do, and Valve has created a system which enables me to do it full-time, and to learn and improve every single day. Explain to me again why I secretly want to go develop the gaming equivalent of a TPS report? However, even if the industry was a wonderful utopia, I actually kind of like working from home and not having a boss. Is that wrong? Am I bad person? Nah. I ve got a pretty sweet gig. And that s thanks to Valve and Gabe. That s right, I said it! COME AT ME, INTERNET, LET S RUMBL&mdash;no I already regret saying that please do not come at nor rumble me. To me, Gabe is still the same good guy he always was. But we need to realize a few things about Valve. First and definitely foremost, they suck at communication. There are legitimate reasons for this that I could get into, but I won t bother. We know they suck at communicating. And that recently hurt modders. Because Valve communicated their plan ineffectively, it turned people off completely, which meant hey, modders might not get paid at all! As a modder, that makes me sad. Actually, it makes me worry about eating. Which is more scary than it is sad. Secondly, and let s be honest, Valve s plan kinda sucked. If you re going to announce a bold new initiative, you should probably avoid mentioning that part where you re not going to pay people a majority of what their sale earns. Even if a handful of Skyrim modders could quite plausibly make hundreds of thousands of dollars in the near future, the revenue splits we ve all seen just don t look great. And that big uproar Valve faced is proof that Bad Marketing leads to Bad Stuff. I admit, the community response was surprising and worrying.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/gabe-newell-answers-questions-about-paid-mods-on-reddit/\">Seeing Gabe downvoted on Reddit</a> is, uh&hellip; spooky! But I m also deeply impressed with how legitimate the community s gripes have been. I hope Valve reads some of the discussions on Reddit, because they re precisely not whiny entitled gamers crying about having to pay for stuff. People immediately identified serious and troubling issues with Skryim s paid-modding plan. I do think there are solutions to the current situation. If people are opening their wallet, they want to get something great as a result. The idea that anyone, regardless of curation or objective criteria, can simply charge $100 for an Extra Apple, isn t alright. There should be some level of subjective, human-level curation. I believe that 3rd party DLC works well. You have to put in time and effort as a developer, but customers like knowing that they re getting quality content. After all, customer happiness should be what matters, even if Valve hates the idea of bottlenecks. The next glaring issue is paid mods ceasing to function or breaking your game. Obviously, that is unacceptable, and a 24-hour refund policy is inadequate. Perhaps most importantly, gamers do not want to pay for bugfixes on a product they ve already purchased. The workshop should have a clear promise to customers (a rule, if you will): bugfixes and bugfixing mods will be FREE for customers, even if that means bugfixing contributors have to settle for donations. Incentivizing people to fix bugs in AAA games is wrong -- that s the developer s job. The community isn t here to clean up after major corporations, and rules are necessary when the alternative is exploitation and unethical business practices. Talented hobbyists are beginning to become talented pros. As a gamer, I want that. I believe these are important steps forward. Talented hobbyists are beginning to become talented pros, people more capable of delivering high-quality mods to you. As a gamer, I want that. I believe that modders could soon have the opportunity to pursue their own path and explore interesting ideas with totally unprecedented creative and financial freedom&mdash;I don t believe that s bad for modding culture . Quite the opposite. Valve, please put together a plan that sucks less; or at least, seems to suck less. But, most importantly, please continue to support modders. Like you ve done. Like no one else really does. As a modder, I appreciate it more than I could possibly tell you in this short article. Over the past three years, you guys have literally changed my life for the better, and an internet mob will not deter me from saying it. <em>Read more of Shawn's thoughts on the issue of paid modding and Valve's announcement on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/33xje2/i_make_a_fulltime_living_from_the_steam_workshop/\">this Reddit discussion</a>.</em> ",

        "contents": "The <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/esl/\">ESL</a> is negotiating a deal with Twitch, Vulcun, and top <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/\">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> teams to establish a new CS:GO league independent of Valve. What's particularly interesting (and potentially alarming) about the plan is that according to the <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/esports/esl-vulcun-twitch-tournament-exclusivity/\">Daily Dot</a>, the new league would be exclusive, meaning that teams playing under its auspices would not be allowed to play anywhere else. The ESL, however, says it's not seeking to prevent teams attending tournaments put on by other organizations. The plan is being backed by <a href=\"https://angel.co/vulcun\">Vulcun</a>, which earlier this week announced that it had raised $12 million in new financing through investors including Sequoia Capital, Universal Music Group, Mark Pincus of Zynga, and other \"angel investors.\" Sources say the total value of the package offered by ESL and Vulcun runs around $18 million, a \"hefty chunk of which\" will be paid to teams in exchange for the exclusivity agreement. The deal will also reportedly see exclusive online broadcasting rights granted to Twitch. The exclusivity angle was challenged by Managing Director of Pro Gaming Ulrich Schuzle, however, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theflyingdj/status/586570362785296385\">tweeted</a> a link to an ESL post on <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/324oo1/esl_vulcun_twitch_in_talks_to_lock_down_top_csgo/cq7vylz\">Reddit</a> shortly after reports of the negotiations came out. \"There is only one thing to say about this: ESL is not interested in locking out any tournament organizers from running CS:GO events, nor teams from attending them,\" it states. Either way, as the Daily Dot points out, it seems clear that the ESL would like to distance itself from Valve. The CS:GO tournament at ESL One Cologne announced earlier this year is billed as the largest in the world, with a $250,000 prize pool, but unlike previous tournaments that were \"community funded\" in conjunction with Valve, this year's event is being covered entirely by the ESL. The change struck me as odd at the time&mdash;why say \"no\" if somebody else wants to foot the bill?&mdash;but now it's making a little more sense. An awful lot of questions remain unanswered, including how the new league would handle <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-issues-expanded-warning-against-betting-among-pro-csgo-players/\">Valve-imposed bans</a> on players involved in the recent match-fixing scandal. It's not yet a done deal, and the report says other CS:GO organizations are trying to reach Valve, which is apparently in the midst of its annual employee holiday in Hawaii, in hopes that it will intervene. If they can't, or if Valve decides to stay hands-off, it will mean some very big changes to the pro CS:GO scene. ",

        "contents": "<em>Earlier this week CS:GO released an&nbsp;update that made significant changes to some of the core aspects of the game, including the design of popular maps, weapon balance, and&nbsp;tagging (movement speed loss when shot). We asked Counter-Strike expert and commentator&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thooorin\"><em>Duncan Shields</em></a><em>&nbsp;to outline what these changes mean for CS:GO.&nbsp;</em><em>&mdash;PCG</em> <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/03/11734/\">The&nbsp;CS:GO&nbsp;update released on March 31st</a> contained numerous fixes, particular to some key weapons for the competitive scene and to most of the maps used in the Active Duty map group. Let's run through the major adjustments Valve made. Slower sniping The AWP has been changed so that players move much slower while scoped in. This change takes many of the standard AWP pick spots and turns them heavily into the favor of the Counter-Terrorist (CT) sniper, as the Terrorist will not be able to scope in before moving out to take a shot quickly, where previously it would have been a similar chance for both snipers and the offensive sniper could have perhaps gotten away to cover if he missed his shot. The impact this will have on the competitive scene is likely to be drastic, as AWPing was already a niche skill and it was rare to even see teams run two AWPs on either side of the game. In particular, teams like Titan and Na`Vi, who rely heavily upon the individual sniping strength of kennyS and GuardiaN, should find some difficulty in adapting, as they will get fewer&nbsp;T-side kills from their AWPers and lose a key strength from their stars. Players of CS 1.6 may note that the changes are more in line with how the AWP was back in that iteration of Counter-Strike, but a key difference is that quick-scoping&mdash;firing without letting the scope animation complete&mdash;was significantly more accurate and possible to control back in 1.6. In CS:GO, there is a random component to quick-scoping, meaning that AWPs are more likely to be overrun and killed. The kill bonus for AWPs was already weak to the extent that the weapon's strength primarily lay in either having a star AWPer or being able to control a position and win the round, thus making back some of the investment via the round win bonus. On their own, AWPs are highly cost-inefficient weapons, unable to make back the money spent on them purely by kills made with them. Many in pro scene have already spoken out about this change and it is hoped that it will be in some sense reverted, though, knowing Valve, that does not seem entirely likely. The Tec-9 nerfs To say the Tec-9 was overpowered previously would be a vast understatement. The pistol was so powerful that it made sense to buy it on every single save round as Terrorist at the pro level, such was the likelihood of being able to get a kill and then parlay that into picking up a weapon. Teams like FNATIC and EnVyUs were already the best in the CZ era and adapted to become even more frightening with the Tec-9. Typically, weapons should be balanced in CS around making their accuracy related closely to how much you have to stand still to achieve such accuracy. The Tec-9 betrayed that balance and thus threw off the whole standard dynamic of CS:GO. Yes, we saw more T side rounds won, but it came at the price of the integrity of how the CT side should conceptually be able to be played. The changes see the damage of the weapon fall-off, hopefully preventing some of those&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ43iILmlD0\">long,&nbsp;random headshot kills</a> onto enemies with full weapons, and rewarding the ability to close the distance. The magazine size has also been reduced to 24, since it could essentially be spammed with impunity in its previous, 32-shot capacity. M4A1-$ The price of the M4A1-Silencer was increased by $100 to $3,200 to \"align the weapon s price with its utility,\" Quite a bizarre statement, really, in light of the fact its lower clip size of 20 bullets, in comparison to the M4A4's 30, already balanced the weapon heavily against its unsilenced counterpart. Many pros have already begun practicing their M4A4, as that $100 and 10 more bullets is suddenly looking vastly more cost-efficient. Running and gunning A regular complaint from professionals is that the movement speed and lack of tagging has allowed too much mobility from Terrorists, who seemingly fly around corners and overwhelm opponents who have even hit them on the way. The introduction of&nbsp; <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=412879303\">increased tagging</a>, based on weapon, looks to help balance that out and reward those who land shots on their opponent, hopefully allowing spots such as the pit in long A on Dust2 to be more easily covered when one does not immediately get the kill.&nbsp; All aboard Train has, as previously promised, been added to the Active Duty group. In the early days of CS:GO, as in 1.6, this was a core part of the map pool, but was reduced due to both being considered tremendously CT-sided and rarely being picked to be played in competitive games. The new train has been reworked and it has been promised to be easier to secure bombsite takes with, particularly at the outside site. With the advice of some pro-gamers apparently having been taken on board, hopes are high that the map can bring a new dynamic to the map pool in the pro scene. The old Train suffered from the differences between 1.6 and CS:GO, as it did not allow players to move under trains, a key component in 1.6 to allow Terrorists to hold onto sites after planting and not be easily found. Even with the outside bomb spot moved closer to the Terrorist mid, the map was still heavily biased to the CT side. NiP's early dominance on the map scared many top pro teams away from playing it, leading us into the era of it being almost permanently banned, similar to the status nuke has taken on now among the top teams. <em>I'm Duncan \"Thorin\" Shields, also known as \"The Esports Historian,\" and I've been involved in esports journalism since 2001.

TRIGGERNOMETRY We write about FPSes each week in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/triggernometry\" target=\"_blank\">Triggernometry</a>, a mixture of tips, esports,&nbsp;design criticism, and a celebration of virtual marksmanship. <em>Article by </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lurppis_\"><em>Tomi \"lurppis\" Kovanen</em></a> The fifth CS:GO major is days away as the world s best teams are soon starting their travel to Poland for&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.esl-one.com/csgo/katowice-2015/\">ESL One Katowice 2015</a>, where the new world champions and winners of $250,000 will be crowned after four days of play, beginning this&nbsp;Thursday. 16 of the world s best teams are present, including the top eight finishers from the previous major,&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-biggest-stories-from-csgos-dreamhack-2014-tournament/\">DreamHack Winter 2014</a>. Joining them are eight teams from the offline qualifier, which also took place in Katowice, a month ago. In this preview we ll focus on the absolute best teams present in Katowice. For a longer preview featuring all sixteen squads, head over to&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\">HLTV.org</a> for their ESL One Katowice 2015 coverage, including interviews with every team in attendance. Pronax at MLG Aspen. <strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Fnatic</strong> <em>Sweden</em> (flusha, JW, KRiMZ, olofm, pronax) Fnatic have a strong case for being the world s best team right now and likely come into the major as the favorites to win it all. Three of their current players won the very first CS:GO major roughly 15 months ago, and now the organization is vying to become the first team to bag two majors in the game. After a surprising loss to NiP at MLG Aspen, the black and orange regained their top spot with a dominant performance at Pantamera Challenge that saw them top four of the world s best teams in a day filled with action in Stockholm. pronax s team has a favorable group draw, and are a favorite against every team in the world in a best-of-three series. If the ex-LGB duo of KRiMZ and olofm keep their performance up, and flusha resurfaces, fnatic could easily become major champions come Sunday. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 1st Shox, as a member of&nbsp;Team LDLC. <strong></strong><strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">EnVyUs</strong> <em>France</em> (Happy, kioShiMa, NBK, shox, SmithZz) Definitely a top two team in the world right now, EnVyUs formerly known as LDLC are the defending major champions from DreamHack Winter three months ago, and more recently have won MLG X Games and placed third at Pantamera Challenge. Not a bad resume, but the recent loss stings. Though fans will tell you how amazing Happy is as a caller, his leading is actually fairly poor compared to his peers, as his team usually wins by pure skill instead. In fact, Happy in 2015 is a much better fragger than he is a leader, based on how EnVyUs plays. Key players for EnVy are shox, previously the world s best player, and kioShiMa, whose inconsistent entry fragging can be the key to nV s wins, or the reason for their downfall. Their play will decide whether NBK tweets out of frustration or happiness at the end of the event. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 3-4th NiP&nbsp;veteran&nbsp;GeT_RiGhT. NiP <em>Sweden</em><strong> </strong>(allu, f0rest, friberg, GeT_RiGhT, Xizt) The Swedes of NiP went through a roster change after a disappointing showing at Pantamera Challenge, despite top two finishes at DreamHack Winter and MLG X Games, and a win at ASUS ROG in late January. They removed Maikelele to add former mousesports member allu&mdash;who is not Swedish. That allu is a Finnish player who speaks Finnish as his native language could be a problem in the short-term for NiP, depending how well they are able to work around the potential communication issues that might surface. Another big factor is their style&mdash;has Xizt finally let go of their years-old setups? NiP once again pack so much skill that with their routine it s hard to imagine them not making the semi-finals in Katowice. From there on out the differences will be so small that even allu s communication could matter, but if he, f0rest and GeT_RiGhT are firing on all cylinders, it won t. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 2nd Pasha <strong>Virtus.pro</strong> <em>Poland</em> (byali, NEO, pasha, Snax, TaZ) Virtus.pro have had a rocky few months in 2015, with group stage exits at both ASUS ROG, a tournament with weak competition, and Pantamera Challenge, to show for their efforts. Last year Virtus.pro broke through as an elite team at this event, and they will hope to repeat their performance. While Snax remains one of the world s best players, the best player of the team, Pasha, has regressed considerably since his peak in the second and third quarters of 2014. If he returns to a form resembling a top five player in the world, Virtus can win the entire event. Realistically there is nothing to suggest&mdash;aside from last year s precedent&mdash;that Virtus would be competing for a win here. However, given the home soil advantage they believe in, and the added motivation, it s reasonable to expect them to bounce back in Katowice. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 3-4th kennyS, currently&nbsp;the world's&nbsp;best CS:GO player. <strong>Titan</strong> <em>France</em> (apex, Ex6TenZ, kennyS, Maniac, RpK) Titan have&nbsp;the world s best player in&nbsp;kennyS and one of the sharpest CS minds in Ex6TenZ. At Pantamera Challenge they proved they can hang with the best, and they will have a chance to score a huge upset when facing their countrymen EnVyUs in the group stage. It s unclear whether Titan are good enough to win multiple best-of-three series against top teams, but they are dangerous enough that none of the teams listed above would like to face them. A lot will depend on apEX, whose performance has been very inconsistent. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 5-8th Device <strong>Team SoloMid</strong> <em>Denmark</em> (cajunb, device, dupreeh, karrigan, Xyp9x) TSM have only attended one tournament so far in 2015, but they had a very good showing in Aspen, finally winning a best-of-three series&mdash;even if in the third place decider match&mdash;against a team legitimately stronger than them. Since the Danes have not been active so far in the year, it s hard to say whether they ve been able to fix any of the issues that have plagued them for years&mdash;especially since the issues are big games, which you can t play from home. It s more likely they ll face another earlyish exit. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 5-8th Canadian-born&nbsp;Semphis plays for Cloud9, currently the best North American team. <strong>Cloud9</strong> <em>USA</em> (n0thing, semphis, sgares, ShahZaM, shroud) The Americans of Cloud9 had a very weak autumn last year, culminating in the removal of Hiko for ShahZaM. Though they scored an upset win versus NiP at MLG and beat a weak Mousesports team at the offline qualifier, there simply isn t enough proof of Cloud9 being able to perform consistently. In Katowice they will be in the toughest group with both Virtus and TSM present, so already advancing out of it would be an impressive feat. Odds are against Cloud9, but it s definitely not impossible to see them in the quarter-finals. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 9-12th Zeus (middle) and Edward (right). <strong>Natus Vincere</strong> <em>Ukraine</em> (Edward, GuardiaN, seized, starix, Zeus) Na`Vi were one of the top five teams throughout last fall, but they have not attended a single tournament since DreamHack Winter. To further add to the confusion,&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/14134-starix-were-going-through-a-crisis\">Starix</a> said in his video blog that he may be getting removed from the team. At this point Na`Vi are a complete dark horse who could crash out in the groups or make a deep playoff run, thus making them one of the most exciting teams to follow going into ESL One Katowice later on in the week. <strong>Prediction</strong>: 5-8th <em>You can reach <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lurppis_\">@lurppis_ on Twitter</a>.</em> ",

Today, Evan and Tyler argue whether or not betting on e-sports is a healthy part of its growth, or if it will only lead to more problems like the recent match fixing scandal.</em> <strong>Evan: UH, YEAH.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\">Every week</a> seems to bring another <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-issues-expanded-warning-against-betting-among-pro-csgo-players/\">shocking</a> revelation that <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/new-evidence-of-counter-strike-global-offensive-match-fixing/\">more professional Counter-Strike players</a> have thrown matches in order to win <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/best-cheap-csgo-skins/\">in-game skins</a> through <a href=\"http://csgolounge.com/\">CSGO Lounge</a>, a third-party betting site. These players have thrown their careers away in order to earn hundreds or a few thousand dollars worth of weapon skins. Their actions have devastated CS:GO s integrity as a competitive game. It s unclear how long these events will leave a scar on the scene, but for many, it s already gutted their interest in what was a thriving, growing e-sport. <a href=\"http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/10-sports-cheating-scandals.htm\">Say it ain t so</a>, ShahZam. <strong>Tyler: NO WAY!</strong> Sports and gambling go together like pure rocky mountain spring water and the best High Country barley! Where there are sports, there are bets (and watery, ice cold beer, mm). So, if e-sports are in fact sports, it follows that betting is inevitable, and I say it s healthy. Except when it s compulsive (unhealthy gambling is a problem of its own), betting on sports is an expression of passion. It s saying, I follow this so closely I can out-predict you. And it s just fun. It adds a layer of excitement and investment in the game, even if you ve only got a buck down. <strong>Evan:</strong> If an e-sport needs that extra layer of excitement to survive, it doesn t deserve to. <strong>Tyler:</strong> I don t think betting is necessary&mdash;people are still going to watch the Super Bowl even if they aren t in a pool&mdash;but the fact is that it does increase investment and help the sport grow. And that s good! Tomi lurppis Kovanen <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-e-sports-lol-dota-2-csgo-hearthstone/#page-2\">said himself</a>: There is so much evidence in terms of viewership growth that betting is great for CS:GO that this really should not be a discussion. <strong>Evan:</strong> Here s the difference: most e-sports don t have a singular governing body like the NFL or FIFA (which have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlJEt2KU33I\">their own problems</a>, certainly!) to police these issues. Riot does the best job of it&mdash;they committed themselves to manicuring every aspect of their game a long time ago. But in CS:GO s case, it was actually CSGO Lounge&mdash;the betting service itself&mdash;that exposed players wrongdoing after noticing suspicious betting. That s completely absurd! That s like relying on the Mafia to report on racketeering. <strong>Tyler:</strong> Even if CSGO Lounge is the wrong entity to police this, it still did. Clearly there are people who want to make this work, and e-sports just needs to grow into it. We ll figure out which players and teams can be trusted, which ones police themselves and promote fair matches. There s a demand to put money on e-sports, and that demand is increasing viewership and getting more people into it. Because of that, it will get better. There s money to be made, which means cheaters won t be tolerated. Capitalism at work! <strong>Evan:</strong> It s greed and immaturity at work. Look, I like that CS:GO and Dota 2 have open markets for items. It s generally a good addition to their ecosystems. But the extent that the CS:GO scene has given betting a full-on, legs-wrapped-around-each-other embrace makes me uncomfortable. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Officialf0restCS/posts/727236547313213\">Teams make their own weapon skins</a> in hopes that they ll get officially released so they can get a cut of their Steam Market income. Leagues like <a href=\"http://play.faceit.com/\">FACEIT</a> feature CSGO Lounge as sponsors and talk about betting like it s just another, normal aspect of commentary. I m sure that betting has attracted a larger audience, but it s also permeated competitive CS:GO with paranoia. Was that poor performance by LDLC just them having an off-day? Was that victory by North American underdog Cloud9 legitimate? In the same way that hacks! has been a ubiquitous accusation, these events have undermined competitive play for the foreseeable future. <strong>Tyler:</strong> But that s just the thing: over time, people will stop betting on matches clouded with doubt. No one wants to put money (or skins that cost money) on a suspicious competition. They ll take their money to tournaments and matches they can trust, and in return, those organizations and teams will get bigger viewership and the untrustworthy will falter. And the whole CS:GO skin thing is just one little part of this.&nbsp;I truly believe that right now we re just seeing growing pains. We re seeing a sports scene which hasn t quite matured discover the consequences of poor behavior, and it s going to get better. <strong>Evan:</strong> In the meantime, betting s affecting everyone s spectating experience. It s gotten better, but <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/why-are-ddos-attacks-so-hard-to-stop/\">DDoSing</a> still disrupts matches to the point where they re rescheduled or need to be cancelled altogether. <strong>Tyler: </strong>I ll <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-e-sports-lol-dota-2-csgo-hearthstone/#page-2\">return to lurppis</a> to field that one. It is easy to blame DDoSing only on betting, but it was already taking place in the CS 1.6 days when betting didn t really exist, he said. Some people just want to see the world burn. And it s true, DDoS attacks are <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/why-are-ddos-attacks-so-hard-to-stop/\">difficult to counteract</a>, and they happen all the time for no reason whatsoever. Betting is just another excuse for dicks to be dicks, but they were already dicks. <strong>Evan:</strong> If e-sports&mdash;CS:GO in particular&mdash;want to become truly mainstream, they need to kick their reliance on gambling for growth. They need to stop embracing betting as something that s married to the metagame. Match fixing remains a threat to competitive games, and more betting and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/league-of-legends-fantasy-site-vulcun-announces-1-million-prize-pool/\">fantasy e-sports</a> sites are popping up. Consider this: there are no real safeguards in place to prevent underage people from using their parents money to buy in-game skins, then gambling with them. <strong>Tyler:</strong> I agree that that s a problem. But hell, it s a problem in gaming as a whole. How many purchase systems in free-to-play games could be considered gambling? What about buying TF2 keys? One thing I think needs to happen is a move away from things like&nbsp;skins. Stand-ins for money won't do&mdash;there should be no way to pretend gambling isn't gambling.&nbsp;If you want to bet on CS:GO or any other e-sport, you ought to have to do it properly... you know, with a company that<em> legally</em> takes your money. It may be seen as a low form of entertainment, but with safeguards against abuse (both from players and betters), betting is just a bit of fun and it ll do a lot to grow the scene. I admit that, right now, I wouldn t want to bet on CSGO or any other e-sport&mdash;I ll probably stick to hockey&mdash;but give them a few years and I think the market will figure itself out. ",

The statement opens with the same warning that accompanied the lengthy bans of pro CS:GO players in <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-seven-csgo-pro-players-for-match-fixing/\">January</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-suspends-19-more-csgo-players-for-match-fixing/\">February</a>: That players, teams, and anyone involved with professional events should never bet on matches or associate with those who do. But then it moves beyond that to explain that it's not just impropriety that's the problem, but also the mere appearance of impropriety. \"As a professional player, team manager or event production staff, it is common to have personal relationships and/or privileged information about other teams and players. Because of this, we will always assume that you have access to private CS:GO-related 'inside information' that might give you an unfair advantage when placing a bet on any CS:GO game or match,\" Valve wrote. \"Betting using inside information, or even the perception or suspicion thereof, carries a significant risk of damaging your personal brand, your team, your community, and may lead to exclusion from future Valve-sponsored events,\" it continued. \"To avoid these risks, we recommend that you never bet on any CS:GO game or match. This recommendation applies both to current professional players and anyone who wishes to participate in a Valve-sponsored CS:GO event in the future.\" Valve said it's important for players to consider the impact they can have on the \"health and stability\" of the CS:GO sport. E-sports are tremendously popular but it's still a relatively nascent business, and if the perception of widespread corruption takes hold, it could seriously impinge upon its future growth. \"Performing before an audience of millions of fans, you are ambassadors for your game,\" it wrote. \"The strength of professional Counter-Strike comes from the integrity of its players and teams.\" ",

The ban means that three teams&mdash;Epsilon eSports, the former ESC Gaming, and WinneR&mdash;will not be eligible to compete in the offline qualifier for the upcoming ESL One Katowice 2015. ESL One has scheduled a \"last-chance tournament\" for February 8 to determine the teams that will replace Epsilon eSports and ESC Gaming, while LGB eSports and 3DMAX will take WinneR's position. The league noted that those two teams had been slated to play a third-place match in the second European qualifier, but that will no longer be necessary as both teams will now advance. 14 of the players determined to be involved in match fixing have been given indefinite suspensions that won't be reviewed prior to 2016: * Kevin Uzzziii Vernel; * Joey fxy0 Schlosser; * Robin GMX Stahmer; * Morgan B1GGY Madour; * Damian DiAMon Zarski; * Michal bCK Lis; * Jakub kub Pamula; * Mateusz matty Kolodziejczyk; * Michal michi Majkowski; * Karol rallen Rodowicz; * Mikolaj mouz Karolewski; * Grzegorz SZPERO Dziamalek; * Pawel innocent Mocek; * Jacek minise Jeziak; Another five have been declared ineligible for ESL One Katowice while the investigation continues: * Robin r0bs3n Stephan; * Tahsin tahsiN Sarikaya; * Koray xall Yaman; * Ammar am0 Cakmak; * Antonin TONI Bernhardt; Valve again said that professional CS:GO players and teams \"should under no circumstances gamble on CS:GO matches\" or associate with those who do, a position echoed by the&nbsp;ESL. \"At ESL, we want to underline the fact that unsportsmanlike behavior, such as match fixing, will not be tolerated, and therefore the banned players will not be allowed to take part in any ESL CS:GO tournaments until these cases are reviewed by Valve,\" it <a href=\"http://www.esl-one.com/csgo/katowice-2015/news/update-on-the-offline-qualifier-including-disqualifications-invites-and-more/\">said in a statement</a>.

Players involved in the fix used \"smurf accounts\" to place high-value bets on the match through the CS:GO Lounge, according to the claims, which have now been substantiated by the powers that be at Valve. \"We can confirm, by investigating the historical activity of relevant accounts, that a substantial number of high valued items won from that match by Duc 'cud' Pham were transferred (via Derek 'dboorn' Boorn) to iBUYPOWER players and NetCodeGuides founder, Casey Foster,\" Valve wrote on the <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/01/11261/\">CS:GO blog</a>. \"All together, the information we have collected and received makes us uncomfortable continuing any involvement with these individuals.\" Seven players will be excluded from \"participation in any capacity in Valve-sponsored events,\" according to the post: * Duc cud Pham; * Derek dboorn Boorn; * Casey Foster; * Sam Dazed Marine; * Braxton swag Pierce; * Keven AZK Larivi re; * Joshua Steel Nissan Valve also laid out the ethical obligations of pro players, managers, and team staff, who \"should under no circumstances gamble on CS:GO matches, associate with high volume CS:GO gamblers, or deliver information to others that might influence their CS:GO bets.\"; \"As CS:GO grows, it s important to consider the substantial impact an individual professional Counter-Strike player has on the health and stability of their sport,\" it wrote. \"Performing before an audience of millions of fans, they are ambassadors for their game the strength of professional Counter-Strike comes from the integrity of its players and teams.\" The ESL, which recently announced a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-announces-250000-prize-pool-for-csgo-at-katowice-2015/\">$250,000 prize pool</a> for the upcoming CS:GO Katowice 2015 tournament, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2tro2y/official_blog_post_fairplay_and_integrity/co1qiya\">confirmed on Reddit</a> that it would uphold the ban. \"Like the blog post said, none of these players will be able to participate or contribute in any other form to ESL One Katowice or future Majors run by us, and we are currently finalising our verdict regarding other ESL leagues and these players,\" ESL rep theflyingdj wrote. \"We do not have any tolerance for match fixing, have always made clear in our rules that players are not to be involved with any kind of betting and will continue to work on a clean and fair competitive environment for CS:GO.\" The ESEA has also <a href=\"http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=14376\">issued bans against the seven players in question</a>, saying that while the bans are currently set for one year, it reserves the right to extend them indefinitely. It noted that it has since implemented its own policy explicitly forbidding players, managers, and sponsors from betting on their own matches, adding, \"We strongly encourage all organizations, regardless of their affiliation with Valve, to mirror and enforce these bans so that a clear message is sent&mdash;there is no place for match fixing in professional gaming.\" The number of players affected by the ban is relatively small, but the severity of the punishment sends an unmistakable message that match fixing will not be tolerated. Given the growing popularity of professional CS:GO, and the ballooning value of purses attached to tournaments like Katowice, it's a welcome development&mdash;and, I'd say, long overdue. ",

According to ESP's leader&nbsp;'espgodson', the team had no idea Flex was running hacks.

        "contents": "The Counter-Strike: Global Offensive professional scene has suffered another gutshot, as evidence has come to light appearing to corroborate claims that an August 2014 match between iBUYPOWER and NetcodeGuides.com was fixed. Text messages posted by Ashley Blacklotus Leboeuf, a former girlfriend of Torqued player Derek \"dboorn\" Boorn, indicate that the outcome was prearranged, and that alternate accounts were used to place bets on behalf of other team members. The authenticity of the exchange was confirmed by <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/esports/match-fixing-counter-strike-ibuypower-netcode-guides/\">The Daily Dot</a>, which posted screen caps of the exchange as part of a detailed investigation into the affair. Boorn acknowledges in the messages that iBUYPOWER \"really did throw the match,\" and that community member Duc \"cud\" Pham used alternate accounts to place bets on the outcome. Information provided by the betting site CS:GO Lounge, meanwhile, confirmed that Pham used \"smurf accounts\" to place nine maximum-value bets on the match, each of them earning him a return of nearly $1200. Perhaps most incriminating, CS:GO pro player Shahzeb \"ShahZam\" Khan, who now plays with Cloud9, issued a statement acknowledging that he placed a bet on the match based on advance knowledge of the outcome. Leaked images of a chat between Khan and an anonymous third party prior to the match were the <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/esports/cevo-match-fixing-netcode-guide-ibuypower/\">first indication of a fix</a>, although prior to this he had refused to comment on their authenticity. \"The day of this match I had placed a bet on iBUYPOWER. I brought up the bet while talking to Casey Foster, he then voice-called me on Steam Friends and told me to change my bet. He made it very clear the match was going to be thrown,\" Khan said. \"I didn't want to get involved with any of it but I changed my bet, as I thought would be logical at the time while also sharing this information with a friend whom I assumed to have bet the same.\" The CS:GO Lounge said in a statement that it does not tolerate match fixing, and that \"hopefully this will now bet he last of match-fixing drama that we have.\" ",

        "contents": "The PC doesn't have a platform holder, and that's a blessing. But there's no denying that Valve's role is an important one in the industry, and that its&nbsp;decisions often have a tremendous impact on our hobby. With great popularity comes great responsibility: here's how we'd like to see Valve apply itself this year. Make TF2 exciting again <em>Phil Savage</em> My favourite Valve thing of 2014 was the anticipation around the release of Love and War update. There was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzGMgqHkMH0\">excitement</a>, there was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X86vU4h18w\">speculation</a>, there was a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLlLQ3LmZWU\">funny Source Filmmaker video</a>. It was everything a TF2 update used to be, with one exception: the update. There was a time when TF2 updates warranted the amount of excitement they received. The class events were significant. They dramatically changed the way you could play a class&mdash;giving new, divergent tactics to familiar operators. Also maps. TF2 launched with six maps. It now has over 70. The Love and War update didn't have that game changing feeling... Sorry, I'll try that again. With the exception of the Conga taunt, the Love and War update didn't have that game changing feeling. The weapons were good, but I don't think weapons&mdash;even something as well-defined and desirable as <a href=\"https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/B.A.S.E._Jumper\">the BASE Jumper</a>&mdash;carry the same weight they once did. When there's only one way to play a class, a new item set has massive ramifications. Now there are multiple ways to play, and one more doesn't make as much difference. In all, 2014 was a quiet year for TF2. Even the long-anticipated End of the Line community update was muted by Valve's decision not to include the Snowplow map. Their reason, <a href=\"http://forums.tf2maps.net/showpost.php?p=315021&amp;postcount=67\">supposedly</a>, was that it was deemed too confusing and challenging for new players . And this is from the people who made Hydro. This is my worry with Valve now. It feels like they're afraid to take risks. The most exciting new inclusion of the year was the grappling hook, and that happened without fanfare as part of the Mann Co. Beta initiative. Imagine if the same energy and excitement leading up to the Love and War update was rewarded by a new game mode, new maps and a goddamn grappling hook&mdash;all definitively released, rather than hiding away in beta. TF2 would, once again, feel like an event. Yes, maybe one of those maps would be terrible, but that would only make it more exciting when more maps appeared&mdash;these ones learning from past mistakes. Aside from the Halloween event, every map added to TF2 in 2014 was released into beta. In 2015, I'd love to see the confidence come back. To see the TF2 team declare something ready&mdash;not just with a release, but with a week-long build-up that showed how a seven-year-old game could still feel fresh, exciting and essential. Make the Steam Controller work <em>Tyler Wilde</em> It feels like ages ago that we were all talking about <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/steam-machine/\">Steam Machines</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/steam-controller/\">Steam Controller</a>. It wasn t really that long ago, but Valve went pretty quiet on both fronts after a generating a lot of interest. I m still interested&mdash;not so much in Steam Machines, because if I stick a PC under my TV it ll probably be a laptop or something I build myself, but in the Steam Controller. I m fascinated by what Valve s trying to do with the thing. Back <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/steam-controller-hands-on-at-gdc-2014/\">when Evan tried it last year</a>, he found the trackpads unwieldy, but if Valve can really design a new kind of controller that both emulates a mouse (and it ll never be as effective, of course) and works for games I d rather play with a d-pad or analog stick, then we may have a new <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-controller-for-pc-gaming/\">best PC gaming controller</a> in our hands. It s promising that, after we were a bit unimpressed by the first demos, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/new-steam-controller-mockup-appears-in-latest-client-beta/\">new mockups keep appearing</a>, which suggests that Valve is still tinkering with the whole design. I hope we see the latest prototype soon, and I m betting we will <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/us/news/gaming/consoles/valve-won-t-be-at-ces-2015-large-steam-machine-presence-planned-for-gdc-1273542\">at this year s GDC</a>. Grow CS:GO <em>Evan Lahti</em> CS:GO became, with plenty of breathing room, the second-most played game on Steam in 2014, hitting 400,000 concurrent players for the first time this month. A lot of that growth is owed to CS:GO s reawoken popularity <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-e-sports-2015-preview/\">as an e-sport</a>: more people than ever are watching competitive Counter-Strike, and the recent <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-biggest-stories-from-csgos-dreamhack-2014-tournament/\">DreamHack Winter</a> tournament (even with <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-competitive-scene-embroiled-in-hacking-scandal-as-three-players-are-banned/\">a bit of controversy</a>) was an exciting watch. But Valve s content updates, patches, and e-sports aid hasn t come close to the support given to its flagship game, Dota 2. CS:GO s support isn t proportional to its popularity, and Valve faces a playerbase that s hungry for anti-cheat fixes, new maps, weapon skins, and ways to engage with the game they re invested in if they want CS:GO to retain its position as the most popular FPS on PC against games like Evolve and Rainbow Six Siege. Valve needs to continue to keep pace with hackers, and it needs to look to the old days of TF2 for ideas on launching in-game events that don t simply feel like money-grabs veiled in playfulness. But what would really propel CS:GO is a proper, The International-level major tournament&mdash;something that Valve owned and operated itself rather than relying on CS:GO s great-but-fragmented leagues to build interest around it as an e-sport. Beyond that, I d love to see a CS:GO API opened up. Part of Counter-Strike is eliminating bad habits, and right now there s no easy way to track your match history (beyond watching your last few replays) or dig into meaningful stats. A full year of Dota 2 updates <em>Chris Thursten</em> In 2015, I'd like to see the Dota 2 team continue to open up about their plans and processes. At the same time, I really hope that they're able to make this a bigger year for the game than last year. A lot of time has been invested in an engine update that will introduce custom game modes and make it easier for Valve to develop new additions in the future. That's great news - and user-generated content represents a potentially exponential increase in the game's scope. At the same time, I don't think I'm alone in wanting a stronger run of official updates. That means more new heroes in 2015 - potentially the first Dota 2-specific heroes - and proper seasonal events. Valve may not see it the same way: they could argue, convincingly, that the future of Dota 2 was and should be in the hands of its community. Be that as it may, I think the last couple of years have shown that leaving everything up to the wisdom of crowds creates confused expectations and entrenches divisions. From the pro scene to the potato bracket, the Dota 2 community could use a bit of stability - and a solid year of official updates from Valve could help establish that. Steam would benefit from a visual overhaul <em>Andy Kelly</em> Steam s feature set took a big step up with the addition of curators and, er, the colour blue in the client s basic skin in 2014. I would like to see a bit of housecleaning on the design of it&mdash;maybe contemporise the fonts a little bit. Reskinning is obviously an option, but I d like Valve s basic layout to be little more up to date. It s still very similar to when I first signed up years ago. On the one hand, that familiarity is nice, but on the other, Big Picture Mode and the Steam app on iOS show how much cleaner the basic layout of Steam could be with a refresh. The thing we all really want <em>Chris Livingston</em> Let's address the strider in the room. For years now, every single bit of Valve news and every update Steam pushes through has resulted in a fresh round of sarcastic yet subliminally hopeful chatter: Half-Life 3 confirmed! To which I say: slow your roll, Internet. We've got some unfinished business to attend to. A broken promise. A missing chapter. A little something called Half-Life 2: Episode 3. I'm confident this is, deep down, what we all really want: another two-to-three hours of content using the same assets and enemies from Half-Life 2. We want to fight more slow, stupid Combine soldiers while they issue their familiar barks. We want to solve yet another giant see-saw puzzle with the gravity gun. We want to stare at a brick wall waiting for a new level to load, then run through the new level for three minutes, then stare at another wall while the next level loads. We want to climb back into that rusty, ugly-ass car and hit the gas only to immediately hit the brakes because the radar is showing a supply cache. We want to spend more time watching Alyx Vance do a bunch of cool things like bashing zombies with the butt of a shotgun or using a sniper rifle or climbing over walls, which we, as Gordon Freeman, cannot do ourselves for some reason. Most of all, we need to hold Valve accountable for their promise, made in June of 2006, that the three episode series <a href=\"http://www.valvesoftware.com/news/?id=648\">will conclude by Christmas 2007</a>. That's the \"three\" that's important, here. Not Half-Life 3. Episode 3. Make it happen. j/k, of course. This year, Valve, just announce something, anything genuine about Half-Life 3, even if the announcement is that it's never going to come. ",

Cloud9 continued their disappointing streak of showings with a measly 5-6 th place finish, and though iBUYPOWER played admirably given their player situation, the real surprise of the event was North American team&nbsp;<a href=\"http://denialesports.com/teams/csgo/\">Denial</a>, who took down Cloud9. Shortly after the tournament finished Cloud9 expectedly made a change, though it wasn t the one anyone expected. The team s star Hiko departed with Denial s AWPer ShahZaM taking his place. Losing ShahZaM effectively killed all the hype built around Denial. iBUYPOWER then recruited back their former in-game leader DaZeD, while also adding Hiko on a temporary basis. To make room for the duo, they cut ties with their newest two recruits nitr0 and desi, who joined after the team shockingly removed DaZeD and steel in the aftermath of ESWC. <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/13918-titan-we-are-ready-to-do-better\"> </a> RpK, above,&nbsp;replaced KQLY&nbsp;on French team Titan. (Photo courtesy HLTV.org.) <strong>Changes in Europe s tier one teams</strong> A few of Europe s best teams made a change in the off-season as well, and a few of them may be yet to come. First and foremost the Danish team Dignitas, who had struggled throughout the fall after consistently making the semi-finals of every earlier tournament in 2014, decided to remove their in-game leader FeTiSh, whose leadership style and individual skills had been called into question, and recruit former mousesports player karrigan. Titan, whose old member&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-competitive-scene-embroiled-in-hacking-scandal-as-three-players-are-banned/\">KQLY was VAC-banned</a> before DreamHack Winter, finally settled on their fifth player after attending ESEA Finals with their coach as a temporary solution. They welcomed back RpK, former VeryGames star who quit playing CS:GO in December 2012. In h s final event before the two year break, he topped the statistics at DreamHack Winter 2012, despite a lopsided loss to NiP in the grand final. In the lower tier teams, Copenhagen Wolves kicked their in-game leader gla1ve, whose&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/13817-gla1ve-handed-gdk-ban-and-fine\">bad behavior&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Gaming.dk Finals</a> earned him a&nbsp;ban from the organizer s future events, and filled his spot with FeTiSh, who was removed from Dignitas. PENTA, who are directly qualified for the next major, recruited nex and strux1 to replace r0bs3n and fel1x. mousesports, oddly enough, removed their star player allu, who currently ranks fourth in the world in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=173&amp;playerid=695\">HLTV.org s statistical database</a>. They also cut ties with tabseN, signed stand-in and mouz legend gob b to a full-time contract, and welcomed back Troubley, who played for the organization in 2012 when CS:GO first came out. Top North American team iBUYPOWER. (Photo courtesy HLTV.org.) <strong>December 2014 tournament results</strong> A few notable tournaments took place in December. fnatic won $20,000 by defeating Virtus.pro in the grand final of ESEA Invite Season 17 Global Finals, with iBUYPOWER rounding up the top three. France then won ESEC Finals, a nations cup-style tournament which limited each country s team to three players from any team, beating Sweden in the grand final. The finalists in Belgrade also featured Poland and Finland. The first MLG qualifier was won by Dignitas, sporting their new member karrigan, who led the team to three impressive best-of-three victories over Titan, Virtus.pro and LDLC. However, it s important to note that Dignitas never stopped performing online even with FeTiSh at the helm&mdash;the team has always struggled when there is more on the line, specifically in big matches. In North America&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mousespaz\">mouseSpaz</a> shocked everyone with wins over iBUYPOWER and Torqued to claim a spot at MLG. mSpaz came practically out of nowhere and quickly won fans over with strong play as tarik lead his team to a surprise win while streaming his matches live. Virtus.pro had to miss out on MLG s second European qualifier with Acer A-Split Invitational s playoffs taking place simultaneously. The Poles won the tournament in Germany and $5,000, by taking down Danish unu.AiN, playing under the banner of Reason Gaming, in the grand final. PENTA finished third with nex, who wound up joining the team, as a stand-in. Second MLG qualifier was then topped by LDLC, who managed to avoid their toughest competition&mdash;fellow countrymen Titan, still playing with coach ioRek at the time&mdash;and took down Polish ESC in the grand final to clinch a spot at the event in Aspen. Across the Atlantic Ocean iBUYPOWER, once again with Hiko playing as a stand-in for the team, defeated their competition in the second MLG qualifier to avoid the embarrassment of having to miss out on the biggest CS:GO tournament on their home soil so far. <strong>Coming up in 2015</strong> 2015 will be kicked off by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/competitions/83\">MLG s inaugural CS:GO event at the&nbsp;X Games</a> in Aspen, Colorado. A total of $50,000 will be given out at the event on January 23-25, where eight teams will be competing for the title. MLG invited fnatic, NiP and Cloud9 for the event early on, and since then the participant list has been filled with Dignitas and LDLC qualifying from Europe, iBUYPOWER and mouseSpaz qualifying from North America, and KaBuM topping the Brazilian qualifier. Merely a few days later will be&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.asusrogtournament.com/\">ASUS ROG Winter</a>, which will hand out $25,000 in prizes for the top four finishers at the tournament taking place at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.assembly.org/winter15/\">Assembly Winter</a>, a large Finnish gaming event on January 30-31 in Helsinki, Finland. First three invited teams are NiP, HellRaisers and Titan. Additionally, a number of online leagues will be kicking off shortly, to ensure there will be plenty of CS:GO to watch on a weekly basis. The list of leagues expected to start in the coming weeks include ESEA Invite Season 18 and SLTV StarSeries XII, with ESL Pro Series Winter 2014-2015 already live. <em><a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\">HLTV.org</a> has coverage for all the tournaments mentioned above, and will be on-site at both MLG X Games in Aspen, and ASUS ROG Winter 2015 in Helsinki, Finland. </em> <em>You can contact <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lurppis_\">@lurppis_ on Twitter</a>.</em> ",

The claims come from the Global Offensive community on Reddit, where estimates put the number of banned cheaters at around 1,600 - and that's a conservative guess. That's a lot of banhammers dropping through the Valve Anti-Cheat System. The new detection abilities of VAC means more than 16 cheat-selling sites can be detected, and anyone caught using their hacks and the like risks being kicked, banned and losing everything. Well, everything in Counter-Strike: GO. Probably not everything in real life. But they also lose the money they've put down on the cheats, so there's that. Anyway, head over to the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2q7flx/biggest_vac_ban_wave_in_the_history_of_csgo/\">Reddit</a> thread and join in the celebrations.

There isn t enough poetry being written about guns. Not literal limericks or sonnets (that would be creepy), but words that dig into and capture what makes one game s AK-47 more fun than another s. Weapon feel continues to be the nebulous catch-all for the nuances that make guns fun. Most of the reviews of shooters I read offer the same praise: guns feel great or feel really powerful. If the writer s being generous, they ll use a word like punchy to describe an SMG. I ve been guilty of this too during my six-year term at PC Gamer. Months of work goes into designing, animating, and balancing the things that put the S in FPS, so maybe we should take a moment to talk about what makes a good gun good. I think the visual design of weapons matters far less than we think it does. There s a tendency, probably because they re planted right in front of our perspective at all times, to think of guns as a collection of aesthetics: firing and reload animations, SFX, screen shake, particle effects, and the death animations they produce. Those things make a gun, right? So if those things are good, surely we have an interesting and fun video game weapon, right? No. Consider the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/AWP\">AWP</a>: it s olive green, it s bland, and its simple animations are more run-of-the-mill than Rambo. The only aesthetically remarkable thing about the most revered, iconic, and infamous sniper rifle in a video game is that it s a bit loud. And yet <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2esnhy/valve_we_need_static_sniper_scopes/\">thousand-comment debates</a> erupt when Valve tweaks the way the AWP s scope works. Why? A gun s look and sound are part of its personality, sure. But if you ask me, <strong>great video game weapons have meaningful, interconnected relationships with other game elements</strong>. Those elements differ from game to game, of course. In CS case, the appeal of the AWP is born from the fact that CS is an FPS with body-part-specific damage modeling and no respawns. In that context, it s the only gun that grants an instant kill if you tag someone above the waist. That feeling of possibility is fun within the strict rules of CS movement: if you can hit it, you can kill it&hellip; but you also can t be moving too much when you fire. With that power comes responsibility, too. Killed players surrender their equipped weapon in CS, and stolen AWPs not only save your team $4750 but act as a kind of trophy. This is doubly the case in CS:GO, where a player s custom AWP skin reminds all spectators which irresponsible player allowed their AWP to fall into enemy hands. Buying an AWP, then, to some extent, announces to the rest of the server: I think I m a good enough shot to protect this valuable&nbsp;asset from the other team. All of&nbsp;this makes&nbsp;the AWP a weapon with abundant meaning. Even its shortcomings (slow rate of fire, difficult to use in close quarters) are a source of fun: the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xppyoB36O6E\">noscope</a> is a revered skillshot. In&nbsp;Tribes case, its&nbsp;weapons shake hands with its&nbsp;player movement really well, arguably the quality that defines it as an FPS. Again, like the AWP, the Spinfusor isn't visually extraordinary: it fires discs at a medium speed, and its animations and SFX are pretty modest. But the Spinfusor is the perfect fit, the perfect baseline weapon in a game where your targets are typically skiing along the ground at high speed. Its splash damage leaves room for error and its relatively slow travel time creates an exciting feeling of uncertainty as you admire your shot. Like throwing up a three-pointer in basketball, you get to experience that arc of Will it go in? It might not go in. It went in! as the disc travels toward its target. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_voeB6lEr4\">Fusion Mortar</a> creates the same sort of feeling&nbsp;while operating&nbsp;as a parabolic siege weapon. The design of the weapons actually encourages you to spend as much time as possible in the air: the threat they pose encourages you to master movement to have the best chance of staying alive. In each of these examples, the weapons strengthen the meaning and significance of core systems like&nbsp;movement, damage modeling, or&nbsp;weapon purchasing. ",

The overhaul to the map's layout and look has mostly&nbsp;been well-received&mdash;the new&nbsp;Train has a high-contrast look and a less complicated A bombsite.&nbsp; But one new map element&nbsp;that Valve snuck in has already been removed: vile, map-unbalancing&nbsp;birds.

Or, as the video below shows, players could use the pigeons as a flapping platform to glitch into&nbsp;the rooftops overlooking bombsite A, giving them a huge advantage over the CTs.

The Fnatic controversy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/teamldlccsgo\">LDLC</a> came into their quarter-final against&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fnatic.com/players/counter-strike-global-off/\">Fnatic</a> not only&nbsp;having never bested the Swedes, but&nbsp;having lost two straight tournament finals against them. They split the first two maps in their series, and then put up a strong 12-3 first&nbsp;half on the deciding map de_overpass. Though Overpass&nbsp;is very counter-terrorist favored, LDLC managed to win their terrorist pistol round, thus giving them a very good chance of going up 3-0 in the second half&mdash;and practically eliminating fnatic. At 3-13, fnatic successfully used a previously unknown boost, which was so overpowered that it basically breaks the entire map, and thus was immediately ruled illegal by many. After losing the second half 0-13, with olofm boosted on nearly every round, LDLC protested about the boost and DreamHack admins spent the next six hours determining what to do. Upon coming to a conclusion to replay the second half, Fnatic protested and the whole saga continued. Ultimately&nbsp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DreamHack/status/538516337610747904\">DreamHack's ruling</a> was that both teams&nbsp;replay&nbsp;the entire third map, as they found LDLC using another potentially illegal boost. The community was outraged with the decision, and soon after fnatic wound up&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/13731-fnatic-forfeit-ldlc-match\">forfeiting</a> the third map and withdrawing from the tournament. In reality Fnatic probably knew their odds of winning without the boost were non-existent. They took a risk in using it, as there were no clear rules against it&mdash;but it obviously breaks the map when you see it in play. It was a gamble, and it didn t pay off. It s only too bad it took DreamHack so long to come to a decision, thus making the entire situation exponentially worse. <strong>LDLC are world champions</strong> The French came into DreamHack Winter as the world s second-best team, and were seemingly doomed as they drew their kryptonite Fnatic, who were upset by HellRaisers in the group stage, in the quarter-finals. Once past the Swedes, LDLC took down Natus Vincere 2-0 in the semi-finals. In the grand final the former VeryGames trio of NBK, shox and SmithZz drew their long-time nemesis NiP, but this time they could not be stopped. LDLC split the first two maps, but came back from a 13-15 deficit on the final map (Overpass, appropriately)&nbsp;to win in overtime with in-game leader and&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\">HLTV.org</a> MVP Happy leading the way. <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/gallery/view/36815\"> </a> LDLC celebrate their overtime&nbsp;victory over NiP&nbsp;at Dreamhack Winter 2014.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/13745-final-photos-from-dreamhack-winter\">Photo courtesy HLTV.org.</a> LDLC are now the official CS:GO world champions and arguably also the best team in the world, given the importance of the major, and their long track record of second place finishes. It s a shame some will place an asterisk next to their win due to the Fnatic controversy, but LDLC can sleep knowing they had the game in the bag by then, if not for Fnatic s shenanigans.&nbsp; Fnatic are no longer invincible Since their loss at DreamHack Stockholm, Fnatic have been seemingly invincible. In J nk ping last weekend&nbsp;that aura was seemingly gone from the get-go, with HellRaisers coming back from a 4-11 deficit in their match to top group A ahead of them. Though their 5-8 th place finish only comes due to withdrawing from the tournament following the previously covered controversy in LDLC decider, it s hard to make a case for Fnatic standing a chance anymore at the 3-13 deficit they faced on Overpass. The kings of CS:GO for the past three months have been slain, and with the drama surrounding the team anything but done, it remains to be seen what happens with one of the most dominant teams of all-time. NiP return to the top <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nipgaming\">NiP</a> were the defending champions from the previous major in August, but had not made the top four in any tournament since then, or qualified for any online league s finals. Following their roster change that in early November saw Fifflaren retire and Maikelele join on a trial basis, it was unclear what shape NiP would show up in. The best team in CS:GO history delivered once again, making their fourth consecutive major grand final. Along the way they lost to LDLC in the groups, defeated HellRaisers easily in the quarter-finals, and survived a thriller of a series, including a double overtime game on de_nuke, against their long-time rivals Virtus.pro. Despite falling just&nbsp;short in the grand final, it s safe to say NiP has returned to the very top of professional Counter-Strike. They have found a way to fit Maikelele in their system&mdash;or adjust the system around him&mdash;and will only get better as the team has more time to gel. You can expect an official announcement of Maikelele becoming a permanent fixture in NiP any day now. What s next? Coming up next will be&nbsp; <a href=\"http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=14248\">ESEA Invite Season 17 Global Finals</a> this coming weekend in Dallas. The event features eight teams in Fnatic, Virtus.pro, Titan, mousesports, Cloud9, iBUYPOWER and two North American underdogs, but three of those six are using a stand-in. For Titan, their coach ioRekan,&nbsp;ESWC champion from a year ago&mdash;is replacing&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-competitive-scene-embroiled-in-hacking-scandal-as-three-players-are-banned/\">VAC-banned KQLY</a>. mousesports star player allu can t make the trip due to school commitments, and former ALTERNATE member and mouz legend from CS 1.6, gob b, is stepping in. Finally, iBUYPOWER s new member desi is not allowed to play, and ex-member adreN will take his spot temporarily in Dallas. Although it pales in comparison to DreamHack Winter, ESEA Finals will provide three days of solid action, including an all-star match on Friday, and should keep fans entertained for a little longer before the holiday season. In 2015 the first big tournament will be MLG Aspen, scheduled to take place at X Games on January 23-25, with eight of the world s best teams attending. NiP, Fnatic and Cloud9 have been invited, and online qualifiers for both Europe and North America are set to begin soon. <em> You can find Tomi on Twitter&nbsp;at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lurppis_\">@lurppis</a><em>.

        "contents": "<a href=\"/dreamhack-winter-2014-csgo-preview-the-top-teams/\"> </a> DreamHack Summer 2014 photo by Rikard S derberg. <em>Article by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lurppis_\" target=\"_blank\">Tomi \"lurppis\" Kovanen</a>.</em> DreamHack Winter 2014, one of the year's biggest Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournaments, will be held in J nk ping, Sweden on November 27-29, and will play host to the fourth community-funded $250,000 CS:GO major (livestream schedule <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.se/dhw14/2014/11/26/csgo-streams-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). 16 teams will be hoping to remain in competition come Saturday, and in this preview we will take a deeper look at the squads most likely to make a difference. fnatic&nbsp; (flusha, JW, KRIMZ, olofm, pronax) Champions of the first major a year ago, fnatic changed two players in July and since then have won four of the seven tournaments they have attended, including three dominant victories in a row. They also placed second at the previous major in August. KRIMZ has been their best player recently, but virtually anyone aside from in-game leader pronax can carry them in a series. They are clear favorites going into DreamHack, but their players have been named as suspects in&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-competitive-scene-embroiled-in-hacking-scandal-as-three-players-are-banned/\">the recent cheating scandal</a>, which could affect their play even if none of the rumors turn out to be true. LDLC&nbsp; (Happy, kioShiMa, NBK, shox, SmithZz) Built in the French reshuffle in September, LDLC have made the final in four of five tournaments they have attended. They can t seem to beat fnatic, yet consistently defeat everyone else. LDLC are favorites to reach the semi-finals unless they face their kryptonite early in the playoffs. Happy is the team s in-game leader and a solid fragger, NBK is the most versatile player, and shox is the superstar of the team. They play a skill-heavy style that suits the current counter-terrorist heavy meta-game of CS:GO, but as a result struggle on the terrorist sides. Virtus.pro&nbsp; (byali, Neo, pasha, Snax, TaZ) Virtus.pro won the second CS:GO major,&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/5-awesome-moments-from-2014-ems-one-katowice-csgo-championship/\">EMS One Katowice</a>, but have since then struggled to play at the same level. They won Gfinity 3 in August, but otherwise have mostly crashed out in the quarter-finals of the biggest tournaments. They are known for stepping up during the majors, but a win would require strong play from all three of their heavy hitters, namely pasha, byali, and Snax. The Poles haven t been able to fire on all cylinders since Katowice, but a strong individual showing could propel this team over their competition. They may be the world s best terrorist side team at their peak. NiP&nbsp; (f0rest, friberg, GeT_RiGhT, Maikelele, Xizt) The most storied and successful team in CS:GO, they recruited Maikelele to replace Fifflaren earlier this month. Despite winning the most recent major, ESL One Cologne, they have struggled since then. GeT_RiGhT and f0rest are the superstars of the team, and if they wish to make the semi-finals they will need those two to play to their potential&mdash;which hasn t been the case in recent months. Their current level remains a mystery as no one has seen them play much with Maikelele, thus adding to the intrigue surrounding the team. Na`Vi (Edward, GuardiaN, seized, starix, Zeus) Na`Vi broke out in May with a victory over Titan and NiP at SLTV StarSeries IX Finals, and have since then been a consistent top five team with multiple top four finishes in recent months. Their team relies heavily on star AWPer GuardiaN, though riflers Edward and seized can also take over matches at times, but neither is very consistent. They play a very strategic style with one of the all-time great leaders Zeus running the show. Cloud9&nbsp; (Hiko, n0thing, Semphis, sgares, shroud) After adding shroud, Cloud9 exceeded most expectations with their ESL One Cologne performance, but most recently failed to advance from the group stage at two tournaments in Europe. They have been bootcamping in Europe for all of November, so this is a do-or-die event for this team&mdash;it s hard to imagine they will ever get better conditions than now to perform. Their star player is hiko, but n0thing and shroud are just as, if not more, explosive at times. dignitas&nbsp; (cajunb, device, dupreeh, FeTiSh, Xyp9x) These Danes were one of the most consistent teams in the world for the first eight months of 2014, but have since then seen their level of play, as well as consistency, drop. They removed aizy to bring back former member cajunb, adding more skill to an already skilled lineup that may lack in leadership. Their star player device is one of the most skilled all-around players in the world, but often chokes in big matches. dignitas should be one of the teams competing for a top four finish, and this exact roster made top four at the second major. HellRaisers&nbsp; (ANGE1, Dosia, kucher, markeloff, s1mple) HellRaisers are a team who seemingly hold endless potential, but can never realize it in a best-of-three setting, or at the right times. They are incredibly skilled with players such as Dosia, markeloff, and new recruit s1mple leading the way, but lack in team play and tactics. Since their last event they have added well known ex-dAT in-game leader B1ad3 as a coach, so depending on how effective he is we could see a much improved HellRaisers squad at DreamHack. iBUYPOWER&nbsp; (AZK, desi, nitr0, Skadoodle, swag) iBUYPOWER failed to make the playoffs in Europe for a long time despite a few good showings in North America, until finally scoring a second place finish in late October. However, the team was then stripped as they cut their in-game leader DaZeD and another versatile member steel to add two inexperienced players, who likely still need more time. There is a lot of pressure on their star rifler swag, and very skilled AWPer Skadoodle. Making the playoffs would be a good showing for this American side. Copenhagen Wolves&nbsp; (cadiaN, gla1ve, Kjaerbye, Pimp, tenzki) The second Danish team got into DreamHack Winter through the Last Call qualifier on Saturday, and therefore likely aren t in the best shape going into this tournament. Their biggest strength is gla1ve s leadership and the skills of Pimp and youngster Kjaerbye, but they are not favored to reach the playoffs from their group. ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"/csgo-competitive-scene-embroiled-in-hacking-scandal-as-three-players-are-banned/\"> </a> Admissions of hacking by three professional CS:GO players have cast a shadow of suspicion on the CS:GO competitive scene. The outed players, Hovik \"KQLY\" Tovmassian, Simon \"smn\" Beck, and Gordon \"<a href=\"http://www.epsilon-esports.com/news/epsilon-drops-sf-from-csgo-roster/\">Sf</a>\" Giry each received in-game bans through <a href=\"https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869\">VAC</a> earlier this week. The revelations call into question the players past performances, both during online tournaments and at LAN events, where the cheat, which allegedly connects through a player s Steam Workshop, could have been used. For some in the scene, the news also presents the uncomfortable possibility that other professional players have used similar, still-undetected cheats in tournament play. These revelations could not have come at a worse time for CS:GO e-sports&mdash;we re days away from the biggest tournament in the game s history,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.se/dhw14/2014/10/03/250000-counter-strike-global-offensive-tournament-at-dhw14/\">DreamHack Winter 2014</a>. Professional CS:GO players <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/7439-moxxi-zaider-banned-in-denmark\">have been VAC banned before</a>, but arguably not such high-profile players. KQLY, the most prominent player of the three, admitted <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KQLYY/posts/663241367127259\">in a statement on Facebook</a> (that I ve translated from French using Facebook s integrated tool) that he had used a third-party program for seven days. KQLY denied using the program while he was a member of Titan (during the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.se/stockholm14/2014/09/10/dreamhack-stockholm-csgo-invitational/\">DreamHack Invitational</a>, for example, which Titan won). As you may have seen yesterday, I was banned by VAC and unfortunately it was justified, KQLY wrote. I wanted to say that I am really sorry for all the people who supported me, I am aware that with my bullshit, my career is now over and my team in a very bad position. They did not deserve it. When he was offered use of the program, KQLY says, the provider reassured him that many pro players were using it. This is a cheat that doesn t have anything visible on the screen. The only way you d know if someone did it is if you caught them at the point they installed it on that machine and activated it. KQLY has been cut by Titan, who along with Epsilon <a href=\"http://www.dreamhack.se/dhw14/2014/11/21/dreamhack-winter-2014-last-call-qualifier-this-saturday/\">have been disqualified from DreamHack Winter 2014</a> by the tournament s organizers. Their expulsion is a huge blow to both organizations, who have spent weeks training for a chance to compete for the event s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-puts-250000-on-the-line-at-dreamhack-2014-counter-strike-global-offensive-tournament/\">quarter-million-dollar prize pool</a>. Speaking to Swedish newspaper <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/13646-dh-this-has-to-be-a-clean-sport\">Aftonbladet</a>, DreamHack s Head of e-sports Tomas Lyckedal expressed surprise. \"I don t think a pro player has been banned like this since 2001. Of course people have been caught cheating but it s always been semi professionals, never established players. And it s a shame it has to happen so close before the tournament, he said. I really hope that this doesn t happen to more teams, but this has to be a clean sport so if it happens then so be it. Lyckedal also pledged that DreamHack <a href=\"http://esport.aftonbladet.se/esport/dreamhack-will-take-special-precautions-dhw/\"> will take special precautions </a> at DreamHack Winter 2014. Playing in Titan and Epsilon s place will be the winners of a Last Call Qualifier organized by DreamHack that takes place on Saturday. On Friday, Titan <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/13650-kqly-removed-titan-criticize-valve\">issued a statement</a> condemning KQLY s actions. As it did so, Titan also criticized Valve for not working directly with teams to remedy the situation. After KQLY s ban was revealed, Titan says it contacted Valve but was eventually met with dead silence after their initial email exchange. \"Valve opted for a unilateral decision, handing out collective punishment with complete disregard for team involvement in the problem solving process. I contacted Valve earlier today for comment but have not received a response. The nature of the hack KQLY s ban was preceded by <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/news/13624-smn-banned-on-esea-for-cheating\">the ban of Simon \"smn\" Beck</a> on ESEA, a third-party client used by competitive players to find matches and pick-up games. According to ex-pro and <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/\">HLTV.org</a> contributor Tomi Lurppis Kovanen, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lurppis_/status/535068682364669953\">Valve contacted ESEA</a> when it learned of the cheat. The bans of KQLY and Sf that followed, it would seem, were a result of Valve updating VAC to detect the cheat that smn used on ESEA. The cheat in question is allegedly very difficult to detect, so much so it s not out of the question for it to have been used at live LAN events. E-sports commentator Duncan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thooorin\">Thooorin</a> Shields took <a href=\"http://youtu.be/TTQZU9O1v5E?t=7m55s\">to YouTube</a> (embedded above) to speak about the scandal&mdash;primarily to call for calm and an end to the witch hunt for other potential hackers that s overtaken some fans in the scene in the past few days&mdash;but he also gave his own explanation for the type of hack that was allegedly used. It s a cheat that doesn t even have an extreme effect&mdash;unless you really abuse it&mdash;it has layers to it where it can just give you a slight advantage in aiming, says Shields in the video. So if you re already one of the best players in the world, it ll make it so you just look like you re having your best game. It won t even seem like you re hacking and that was an impossible movement. He continues, This is a cheat that doesn t have anything visible on the screen. The only way you d know if someone did it is if you caught them at the point they installed it on that machine and activated it. The impact Titan and Epsilon s disqualification from DreamHack Winter sours the excitement around CS:GO s biggest tournament of the year. For some, the bans have created a cloud of suspicion around other teams and players. Smn, the originally banned player, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2mzmyv/smns_streaming_and_answering_some_questions/\">commented on a livestream on Friday</a> about his ban and the incident, allegedly saying that as much as 40% of the pro scene is using hacks. Of course, that's one person's statement, and it should not be taken as the certain truth.&nbsp;It remains to be seen whether more players will be VAC banned, and whether Valve will take further action,&nbsp;though some members of the community <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2mz3p9/i_made_a_site_that_automatically_checks/\">are already anticipating more bad news</a>. I believe&nbsp;it s important to temper our suspicion and not jump to conclusions that any one team or player is guilty until there s hard evidence to suggest that they cheated. It s been exciting over the past year or so&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-esl-one-championship-watch-these-two-amazing-matches/\">to watch</a> CS:GO blossom into an e-sport that draws hundreds of thousands of spectators at once. And it s been exciting to see the scene grow to support dozens of players and teams around the world. Fighting the hack-making industry, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/hacks-an-investigation-into-aimbot-dealers-wallhack-users-and-the-million-dollar-business-of-video-game-cheating/\">as we ve previously investigated</a>, is a constantly evolving struggle for studios like Valve, who can t be expected to quash every single assistance program&mdash;it s part of the cost of building a popular competitive game. Valve does, however, in cooperation with leagues and teams, have the power to make the punishment for hacking so unpalatable that fewer pros and non-pros would pursue it. Whatever happens next, it s going to make for a fascinating tournament at DreamHack next week. ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"/the-best-and-worst-maps-in-csgo/\"> </a> There is only sadness in Aztec. Sadness and moss. Valve shoveled some new maps into CS:GO <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-launches-operation-vanguard/\">last week</a>, and a couple of them are quite good. Where do these new P90 playgrounds rank alongside CS capitals like de_dust2 and de_inferno? I took a moment to rate every map in the current build. A few things: * I m excluding maps that aren t in the current rotation (e.g. de_blackgold) ;* I m also excluding Demolition and Arms Race maps, because c mon; * I m mostly judging these maps by how they play in 5-on-5 Competitive mode, which is how you should be playing CS:GO (regardless of your skill level); The key criteria here is: <strong>Would I play this map instead of the one below it?&nbsp;</strong> <strong>RANK</strong> <strong>MAP</strong> <strong>COMMENTS</strong> 1 <strong>de_mirage</strong> Mirage is your favorite bagel, toasted evenly. Mirage is a warm, unembarrassing&nbsp;hug from your grandmother.&nbsp;Mirage surfaces&nbsp;the best things about CS:GO. Every entry point in Mirage&nbsp;presents interesting, complementary risks and rewards. Pushing cat to B as a Terrorist is a great example of this: you have to smoke the A connector to do it safely, but that action in and of itself expresses your intention to bring the bomb to B.&nbsp; Adjacent map areas, like apartments and underpass, or ladder room and sniper window, have strong relationships to one another. Map timings at mid window, A ramp, the van at B are all deliberately tuned. The bombsites are tough to take and relatively tough to defend, and the CTs have sneaky options to turn defense into offense in apartments, underpass, and palace. Play Mirage. 2 <strong>de_season</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fmpone\">FMPONE</a> took an average-looking, underappreciated CS map and gave it a gorgeous, high-contrast makeover for Operation Vanguard. The revamp not only gives Season a coherent, original theme for the first time (Japanese laboratory), it also improves how it plays. Patches of bright mustard yellow (on bombsite B) and leaf green (on A) punctuate the sterile white, improving map orientation and making it easier to spot enemies. 3 <strong>de_inferno</strong> CTs have a positional edge on Inferno, but I love that the Terrorists have plenty of options for outsmarting, out-aiming, or overwhelming them. And I love the way Inferno challenges you to throw smart grenades. When and whether to smoke mid, or how you flash into B takes intuition and practice. A series of T-shaped intersections facilitate this: mid, arch, at the banana exit to bombsite B. And unlike hilariously one-sided maps like Aztec, the&nbsp;CTs must&nbsp;make hard decisions about which areas of the map they feel comfortable giving up, like boiler or the busted car inside banana. 4 <strong>de_dust2</strong> The Toyota Camry of Counter-Strike. Dust2 is reliably fun but a victim of its own popularity. It has the easy to learn, hard to master quality we value in games, with the sniping lane down mid being a great example of the latter. Re-taking bombsite B, despite three entry points, is satisfyingly tough for the CTs. Both teams have to hurry to occupy the junction at long A, a perfectly-timed early-round flashpoint. It s wonderful. Can everyone stop playing it, please? 5 <strong>de_cache</strong> Cache is delicious oatmeal: a bit bland, but healthy. No corner of Cache is superfluous&mdash;its uncomplicated three-lane structure is gimmick-free. The tiny vent entrance to B is about as unconventional as Cache gets. That leaves us with a pure competitive map&mdash;it couldn't be more obvious that Cache was co-designed&nbsp;<a href=\"http://volcanotv.tumblr.com/post/36884619789/de-cache-released-for-cs-go\">by a pro player</a>. 6 <strong>cs_office</strong><strong></strong> Office is simpler than a one-color Rubik s cube, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srkFwR11T68\">I have a lot of affection</a> for this comforting camper s paradise. Blowing holes in the mundane, corporate setting remains a big part of the appeal. Shoulder-peeking and entry grenades are the name of the game for the CTs: Office is about small-scale execution of these maneuvers rather than larger map-level tactics, and I like its focus for that reason, but it s also a map that ll earn you bad habits if you overplay it. 7 <strong>de_facade</strong><strong></strong> I m still getting the hang of Facade. I like its raised ledge at mid, which overlooks a pair of dust2-like double doors, forming a treacherous no-man s land. I like the complex configuration of bombsite B, and that it s countered a bit by open windows that beg to have flash grenades thrown through. On the other hand, rotation from one bombsite to another is cumbersome and slow, especially from A to B. 8 <strong>de_nuke</strong><strong></strong> I guess it s possible for Nuke to be more CT-sided than it already is. For instance, the Terrorists could spawn inside a room filled with hungry cobras, or inside an Olive Garden that s just run out of breadsticks. Nuke s mid-less configuration and the rafters above A put the Terrorists at a major disadvantage. There s also some lingering sound problems on the map, especially with Z-axis&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/256kgn/can_valve_do_anything_about_csgos_positional/\">audio behavior</a>. Despite these issues, it remains a mainstay: the same asymmetry that makes it tough for the Ts gives it a unique feel: no other map stacks its bombsites atop one another, for example. 9 <strong>cs_workout</strong> Do you even yoga, bro? This is actually a really nice gym. But it kind of looks like a school? Anyway, Workout is a colorful three-lane map with some&nbsp;interesting stuff happening around T spawn (an awkward middle stairway; a pool area with plentiful hiding spots). I ve had enjoyable rounds on Workout, but mid, the long lane to T spawn, and the middle fountain area are a bit too spacious for 5-on-5 play. It can suck the fun out of the map if the hostages spawn closely together, too. I also don t like how viable the autosniper can be for Ts on this map, but Workout gets points for style and color from me. 10 <strong></strong> <strong>de_overpass</strong> Overpass' unusual layout is both its appeal and a tiny shortcoming, I think. B is one of the most unique bombsites in the game, an exposed concrete perch that the CTs have an elevated line of sight on. The map prompts plenty of tough decisions: A is tougher for the Ts to take but easier to hold. CTs can set themselves up to flank if they scout the tunnel connector aggressively, which can be countered if one or two Ts lurk silently there. 11 <strong>de_train</strong> No classic CS map is more argued over than Train. For many matchmakers it s a mainstay, but some displeased players have gone so far to <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2210xh/why_de_train_should_be_tweaked_suggestion/\">revise the map themselves</a>. One thing s certain: the Terrorists face rough odds on bombsite A&mdash;even rushing at full speed, the CTs are always able to put themselves in a better position more quickly. Dark areas in the train tunnels put the Ts at further disadvantage. For better and worse, the map takes a ton of coordinated grenades to solve on the Terrorist side, making solo-queueing on it a pain. 12 <strong>de_marquis</strong> My rounds on Marquis have been inexplicably positive, despite all the late-round wandering the map inspires.&nbsp;Terrorists face a <a href=\"http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/3363474/simpsons-awkward-collar-pull-o.gif\">collar-tuggingly</a> terrifying route to A on this Operation Vanguard newcomer: long, narrow, and then uphill. B isn t much better, a bite-sized bombsite that s unusually vulnerable to frags and firebombs from three potential entrances. Some of the hiding spots and elbows underground feel pointless to me. The subway setting is at least a convincing combination of weathered graffiti and loose equipment. 13 <strong>de_bazaar</strong> I ve been having an okay time with Bazaar since it released last week. It s a conventional three-lane map with an AWP-friendly mid, albeit with a couple variations: its connectors are weird (like the S-shaped zig-zag from mid to B), and mid has a left- and right-side entrance for both teams. One thing that s missing here is some decor: Bazaar is 80% unpainted walls and grey brick, giving the map an unfinished feel. More landmarks would inspire better map callouts, too. 14 <strong>cs_backalley</strong> CS 1.6 map Backalley has found its way back into the game. I enjoy Backalley a lot in casual play, where throwing bodies at chokepoints to solve problems becomes standard tactics. In 5-on-5, though, the map s vertical areas become pretty superfluous. I like the urban, vagely criminal feel of it, but its biggest issue from a competitive standpoint is that the CTs only have one narrow, deadly entry option on either side. 15 <strong>de_dust</strong> Dust2 s big brother has effectively been retired from competitive play altogether, and these days it s valued for its nostalgia. The route alterations Valve made to Dust when CS:GO released were welcome, but no amount of reengineering can change the fact that both bombsites are absolutely buried in CT turf. It s a piece of history, but hasn t held up as well as most of CS stock maps in Global Offensive. 16 <strong>cs_assault</strong> Assault is the siege-iest of CS' campy&nbsp;hostage maps. The CTs' entry options are universally bad, clumsily mitigated in CS:GO by the addition of glass windows on the facility rooftop. Pressure through these skylights forces the Ts to turtle even more, opening up chances for braver CTs to break through the front and back doors. There's not much for Ts to do here but make like paranoid conspiracy theorists and point their guns at their own doors. 17 <strong>cs_italy</strong> Like Assault, rounds of Italy drag on longer than seasons of&nbsp;Dragon Ball Z. Valve tried to lure lazy Terrorists away from the hostage house by moving one of the prisoners into the wine cellar near the center of the map, but old habits die hard: Italy is still a haven for selfish snipers. Though it d definitely be higher up on this list if the Pavarotti song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaJseJuNGs4\">that played on the radio</a> in CS and CS:S hadn t been cut from the map, presumably for copyright reasons. Lawyers make bad map designers. 18 <strong>de_aztec</strong> Huitzilopochtli, Aztec god of multiplayer maps, is not pleased. Someone at Valve clearly didn t make the correct sacrificial offering. In anger, Huitzilopochtli conspired to give CTs every conceivable advantage: bombsites that are steps away from CT spawn, a bridge that crosses the open air, a horrific ramp, and double doors that open out into two AWP lines for the Terrorists. Temple of Doom indeed. 19 <strong>de_cbble</strong><strong></strong> Hey, I ve got an idea: let s make a map with a massive courtyard overlooked by sniper nests that no one will ever, ever use. Cobblestone in its current form has no business being in the competitive rotation. The action strictly happens around the bombsites, where the Ts have to make treacherous crossings in the open in order to plant the bomb. That said, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/06If0FVHTNQ?t=1h1m3s\">this moment by f0rest</a> was one of my favorites from the ESL One Cologne tournament. 20 <strong>cs_militia</strong> Militia s days as a charming pub map in CS 1.6 are well dead. Its art embraces the hostage theme in a way I like (sewers, creepy sheds), but the extensive modifications Valve made to the front yard are messy, and they haven t done much to make Militia more than a misshapen sniping arena. 5-on-5, you can go multiple rounds without seeing anyone depending on which route you take. 21 <strong>de_vertigo</strong> Moms don t let their babies grow up to design square-shaped maps. Vertigo s OK as a meat-grindery, 12-on-12, casual romp, but as a competitive map it invites no interesting tactics or tough decisions. Let s review the Terrorists options: 1) attack up an exposed ramp 2) attack up an exposed stairway. There s no backtracking, secondary routes, or opportunities for trickery: just two teams headbutting. Don t. ",

Evidence has emerged that three members of the team, including captain Damian \"DiAMon\" Zarski, actually placed bets on their opponents, and then went on to lose the match despite being heavy favorites. Rumors that <a href=\"http://www.alsen-team.pl/\">ALSEN</a> would throw the match were floating around before it even began, according to <a href=\"http://www.hltv.org/n/13437\">HLTV.org</a>, and in the end they did end up losing to <a href=\"http://www.gosugamers.net/counterstrike/teams/9200-eliminacja\">eliminacja</a> by a score of 16-10. After the victory, online betting site <a href=\"http://csgolounge.com/\">CS: GO Lounge</a> revealed that Zarski, as well as players Michal \"bCk\" Lis and Jakub \"kub\" Pamula, had actually placed bets on eliminacja. Lis and Pamula made their bets from their own Steam accounts, while Zarski used four alternate accounts, but also used his primary account to place a smaller bet on his own team. Players betting through CS: GO Lounge wager in-game items, not cash, but the monetary values can still be substantial. Based on the valuations determined by the site, Lis won more than $300 in items as a result of the loss, Jakub won more than $550, and Zarski walked away with nearly $1500 worth of items.&nbsp; The other three members of ALSEN&mdash;Michal \"michi\" Majkowski, Mateusz \"matty\" Kobodziejczyk, and Rafal \"sany\" Pietrzak&mdash;were not found to have been involved in the betting. There is, however, evidence that other EPS Poland teams were aware of the situation but didn't report it; instead, they placed bets of their own on eliminacja, taking advantage of the steep 81-19 odds against them. Given that in-game items were involved rather than actual cash, the exact legality of the situation (or lack thereof) is unclear. But it's incredibly sketchy behavior, and worse, it invokes the specter of rampant match-fixing in lower-tier pro leagues, where oversight may be lax. It's a lot easier to lose a match than it is to win one, and while the most egregious examples may be easy enough to pick out, more skillfully-managed fixing (and let's be honest, using your own Steam account to place bets against your team is pretty ham-fisted) is much harder to pick up on. \"Tournament admins and organizers, and site admins did and will do everything to stop stuff like this,\" CS: GO Lounge admins said in a statement. ESL Pro Series Poland reps have not yet commented. ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"/how-to-scout-in-csgo-and-win-without-fighting/\"> </a> <em>Evan writes about CS:GO and other&nbsp;FPSes each Monday in&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/triggernometry/\"><em>Triggernometry</em></a><em>.</em> <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/\">Counter-Strike</a> became a more interesting game to me the moment I embraced that it's as much about information gathering as it is about gathering sick AWP noscopes. In a five-on-five format&mdash;the way you should be playing Counter-Strike, regardless of your skill level&mdash;CS shrinks to a size that fits in your brain. Every player action&mdash;footsteps, reloads&mdash;produces information, and every information piece paints a clearer picture of what the enemy team is up to that you're meant to adapt your tactics and positioning to. You play within a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space\">possibility space</a> shaped by bottlenecks and fixed spawn positions, and this distinguishes CS from other FPSes, which begs the question: are you playing CS like it's a different game? It s obvious that Battlefield 4, for example, is spatially larger than CS:GO. But think about the way that BF4 s scale, along with the design of its respawn systems, make information decay quickly. Players can spawn on one another, on any owned capture point, or parachute from the sky&mdash;the three medics you saw on capture point D a moment ago can multiply into a dozen by the time the tank you've called in arrives. It's a game of fluctuating hotspots mostly played on open, flankable terrain. It's a game about putting out fires and starting your own. CS, by contrast, is a checkerboard slowly revealed as you move through it. There are only so many positions an enemy can occupy, and unless you leave a hole in your collective vision, they can't magically appear behind you through teleportation. Where enemies are (and, secondarily, what resources they have (HP, armor, weapons)) is reliable information with a measurable lifespan. Without having some of that information, you're simply hoping for the best, relying on your aim to get you out of every situation. Embrace scouting as a necessary aspect of Counter-Strike, and you may improve your win rate on the way to appreciating the tiny maneuvers that drive CS' strategic depth. Jump-Scouting It was during the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-highlights-from-csgos-esl-one-cologne-2014-tournament/\">ESL One Cologne</a> that I finally realized I could win rounds of Counter-Strike with my eyes. There's a position on de_mirage beside the van on bombsite B, and I watched teams jump like kangaroos here, elevating their eyes for a moment each time to peek down apartments. Even if the Terrorists are rushing B flat-out, this move buys the defenders a few more seconds to get their asses to the bomsite, which can absolutely make a difference. (If you're daring, you can also land jumping Scout or AWP shots.) This was a huge epiphany for me; up until then, I'd been hurling smoke into the Mirage apartments at the start of every round on the assumption that someone was there. Smoke has the ability to stop pushes and burn precious time off the clock, but deploying it there was also denying me the opportunity to gather visual information. I was putting myself in a position to be surprised every round and hoping that my aim could get me out of it. Few maps offer the jump maneuver I mentioned on de_mirage as a quick, usually-safe scouting option. More often, the technique you want is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foyWFO4w6R8\">shoulder peek</a>: making the smallest possible movement around a corner with no intention of engaging. The whole idea of the shoulder peek is to not stick your neck out long enough to even observe enemies, but 'process' what you've seen behind cover. You're snapping a quick photo, jerking back, then essentially looking at it in your own brain while you're safe. Do this with a knife out to be as fast as possible. We ll dig into shoulder peeking more&nbsp;another week. The takeaway here is that&nbsp;in&nbsp;CS'&nbsp;five-on-five format there's an unusually high value to knowing where enemies are: it determines your aim, positioning, and grenade tosses&mdash;three essential elements of CS. Part of playing well, then, means learning how to gain information with as little risk to your resources (HP and the weapons you're carrying) as possible. Recognizing the map locations and round situations where information is available at a low cost (i.e. risk to your team s lives, position, or weapons) is a valuable step to playing a more deliberate game.

Good aim can get you out of a bad situation, like a mistimed rush or a weapon disadvantage. Even if you ve been playing CS for a decade, I m willing to bet that, like me, you ve got some bad aiming habits. I ll go first: I m awful with the AK at long range, and I struggle to get kills with the P250 on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-win-eco-rounds-in-csgo/\">eco rounds</a>. I ll probably get better with those guns as I keep putting hours into CS:GO s competitive matchmaking, but bad habits are easy to lose sight of in the middle of a match, when you re caught up in the emotion of the situation. CS:GO also hides a ton of its nuances&mdash;especially the bullet spray patterns of its weapons. Aim maps have a way of immediately illuminating what you ve been doing wrong. Through repetition and drilling, they can teach you a lot about your own bad (and good) aiming behaviors. These are my three favorites. <em>How to play custom CS:GO maps locally:</em> * <em>Subscribe to maps on Steam Workshop</em>; * <em>Launch CS:GO</em>; * <em>Click Play &gt; Offline with bots </em>; * <em>Click Workshop, search for the map you subscribed to</em>; * <em>Select the map, select No bots </em>; training aim csgo 2 <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213240871\">download</a> This is CS:GO s best drill map, and it has a ton of customizability. You can tweak it to test almost anything you need to work on, from long-range AWPing to short-range spraying against targets that take multiple hits to break. I particularly like the sliding test, which lets you set up static or pop-up targets along different axes, letting you practice the rhythm of strafing, stopping, and shooting outside of a live environment. I also get a lot out of the Burst Training, which tracks how many of your shots connect on a full spray. Training: Bot Aim V4b <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=140488121\">download</a> You can work on any weapon on this map, but I ve found it to be best for building pistol skills. It loads a number of bots into a narrow corridor and has a few toggleable obstacles&mdash;crates and a pair of doors&mdash;that you can bring into the setting to make it feel more practical. Bots can be set to return fire or not. The god mode setting is really helpful if you want to focus on training one weapon for a sustained period. aim botz <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660\">download</a> This rifles-and-pistols map is the best one I ve found for working on killing enemies who are moving laterally. The bot movements are a little unnatural (you can also set them to move faster than players can in-game, as in the GIF above), but you can set them to mirror different ADAD patterns (alternating left and right strafing), which can be a particularly tough maneuver to counter. There s a good amount of setting&nbsp;customization, too, including boxes and uneven ground. You can also toggle on impact visualization, which will produce a wireframe of the bot hit that lingers in the environment. <em style=\"background-color: initial;\"> </em> <em style=\"background-color: initial;\">*</em> ",

You re dead, and you re broke. How are you going to win the next round when the enemy team has body armor and rifles and you don t? This is the daunting proposition of an eco round in CS:GO, when your team collectively decides to fight on a budget so it can afford a full complement of gear in the next round. As one of the regular hurdles of competitive play, mastering the eco round is an important part of winning. Here s how I try to make the best of an economic disadvantage. Decide to win I ve solo-queued with so many people who see eco rounds are an invitation to play lackadaisically. You ve got pistols, they ve got rifles let s just get this over with, right? In high-level competitive play, though, eco rounds regularly go the way of the underdog. Part of that is because pro players are so comfortable with pistols, but the other half of that is their mindset: they see eco rounds as an opportunity to gut their opponent s economy rather than a round that they re pre-destined to lose. If you ve already made your mind up that you re going to lose, congrats! You probably will. Buy the pistol (or shotgun) you re most comfortable with If pistols had a popularity contest, the P250 would win. It s beloved for a reason: it s a $300 weapon that can kill with a single headshot at close range. It s more versatile and more accurate than the Deagle in most situations. But if the Deagle or Five-Seven somehow speak to how you play Counter-Strike (and you don t mind buying one fewer grenade next round to offset the cost), go for it. There s plenty of math you can hold up as evidence, but I m a big believer in the idea that you re going to perform best with the weapon you feel the most confident with. Don t rule out shotguns completely, either: mid- and late-game eco rounds are one of the situations where shotguns have a lot of utility. A Nova at $1200 or a MAG-7 at $1800 are several times the cost of a pistol, and tend to favor defensive use, where you can dictate the range that you encounter enemies and pick spots that force enemies to look two ways as they cross a narrow area (like the ramp on Nuke, or banana on Inferno). Holding a weapon that deals a lot of damage all at once is a way of compensating for your fragility and the accuracy-destroying power of aimpunch. Make the enemy encounter multiple pistols at once Unless you brain an enemy, you re going to have to shoot them more than they shoot you. Offset that disadvantage by positioning yourself with a teammate to see and shoot an enemy at exactly the same time. If you re covering an entry door, your teammate shouldn t be able to see an enemy before you do, and vice versa. Because there's less room for error, your timing and angles count a lot on an eco. Do something ridiculous On the surface this seems like it runs contrary to Decide to win, but think about it this way: one of your biggest advantages on an eco round is that you ve got less to lose. Try a strategy that your opponent would never expect, like rushing everyone through palace on Mirage, or making a hard balcony push on the T side of Inferno. On defense, consider stacking a single bombsite with your whole team in the hopes that the Terrorists will split their attack. If you can t beat em, rob em CS:GO is a pay-to-win game: buying power equals firepower. When you steal a weapon from a dead enemy, you re fighting on their tab. Given the choice between fighting on the wrong side of a three-on-one with no armor and cowering in a corner with a nicked AWP, save the AWP. You re probably going to lose more eco rounds than you win, so be willing to take a small gain out of a bad situation. If the enemy knows you ve taken an AWP or another valuable weapon, it may even go out of its way to hunt you down in the final moments of the round. In this situation, a secondary, riskier way to do economic damage to an opponent on an eco is to go for exit kills, or positioning yourself to lose the round, but kill one or two players as they re exiting a known position (usually one at a time, to look for you in the waning seconds of the round).",

There are few better demonstrations of this enduring truth than Fullbright s first-person exploration game Gone Home. Not only has it spawned an hilarious parody featuring lots of things being killed, but now you too will be able to kill things in the titular home, thanks to this Counter-Strike: GO map. \"Your family is mysteriously missing again,\" so says the Steam Workshop description. \"But you can figure that out later. Right now you have more pressing issues to attend to, like the fact that your house is full of terrorists and some dude has been taken hostage. Rescue him by taking him to the garage where you can make a swift getaway on that old bike thats been sitting there for twenty years.\" The hostage map is recommended for less than 32 players, and can be downloaded here. Of course, you could go ahead and play Gone Home again, which comes highly recommended. Thanks Joystiq.",

The messages are being spread by a Twitch bot, according to a recent F-Secure report, which enters channels and invites users to follow a link in order to enter a draw. The link leads to a site that asks for the user's name, email address and permission to publicize his or her name, but once that information is entered, a Windows executable is run that does some pretty nasty stuff: It can take screens, add new Steam friends and accept pending friend requests, initiate trades with new Steam friends, buy items (if there's money present in the user's Steam wallet), send trade offers, accept pending trades and sell items at a discount. Previous variants of this hack were selling items at a 12 percent discount but it's apparently now running at 35 percent. The software is able to completely empty wallets, armories and inventories. \"Being able to sell uninteresting items will allow the attacker to gather enough money to buy items that he deems interesting,\" the report states. \"The interesting items are then traded to an account possibly maintained by the attacker.\" F-Prot notes that all of this happens from the victim's own PC in order to get around Steam security checks that kick in when a user logs in from a new machine. It's a good warning to take note of: Steam may be a very secure environment, but nothing is foolproof. Be careful what you click.",

Playing a competitive online game means being subjected to a certain amount of unsolicited criticism. I think you receive a bit more of it in CS:GO, though, because your dead teammates form a kind of peanut gallery who can talk to you from beyond the grave. Being the last one alive as four other players hover over your digital shoulder is a quintessential CS experience. I ve been that digital shoulder hundreds of times, struggling to clutch while a person I ve never met tells me which gun I should grab to retake Nuke s A bombsite, or chastises me for using a grenade in a one-on-one situation. It s annoying, but I m actually grateful for a lot of the harsh feedback that s been handed to me in these moments because it s shaken me out of some bad habits. Below, a selection of some of the criticism that s been condescendingly muttered at me in CS that turned out to be great advice: Don t reload. Shooters, single-player shooters especially, condition us to reload as a Pavlovian response to getting a kill. Resisting that urge is one of the first things most new CS players have to unlearn. Most weapons in CS:GO take between two and four seconds to reload: plenty of time for someone to peek around a corner or move through the space you should be defending. But maybe more importantly, in close-quarters, reloading betrays your position with sound. Consider the trade-off: would you rather have a full mag and an enemy who knows where you are, or a shallow mag and an enemy who s out of position? Don t underestimate how much you can do with four or five bullets. With a rifle, it takes three or four non-headshots to take an enemy from full health to none and in late-game situations, it s even less likely that the enemy around the corner has 100 HP. Don t pretend. A few months ago one of my teammates in a match I d solo queued into called me out on this. What are you doing? I bet you saw that on Twitch or some shit, right? He was right. I was ADAD spamming (quickly tapping A and D in alternation) to hold a corner on de_inferno. There was no purpose or tactical value to what I was doing, I was just miming something I d seen in a tournament. It was the equivalent of doing a bunch of fancy dribbling in soccer with no one playing defense against me. It s great to experiment with stuff you see in competitive play, but understanding the situational benefits of each maneuver is a huge step toward pulling it off successfully. After the ESL, I started backing away from my own flashbang grenades on entries, something I loved seeing in that tournament. But then I realized that my grenade placement wasn t nearly good enough to guarantee that I was flashing enemies at all I was just imitating for the sake of imitating. Please, please don't throw that grenade. Put the pin back in. I see so much misplaced faith in the frag grenade in CS:GO, partly because I used to be that guy who d start a bombsite retake with a frag toss, often coming around corners while still in the follow-through animation for the throw. Here s what I learned, after someone finally scolded me: your frag isn t going to kill anyone. Even if you re the Joe Montana of grenades and toss directly into the enemy player s mouth, it ll do 57 damage. If you played a lot of CS:Source, where grenades did a max of 72 against armored opponents, take a moment to realize that a perfect toss will only inflict as much as about two bullets. In almost all situations, but especially in one-on-ones, your rifle is going to be able to kill someone faster and more safely than any sort of offensive grenade. Flashes are handy in a lot of situations in CS, but they re also unreliable: you can t be sure how well you ve blinded someone. If I had just kept my gun out instead of reaching for that 4 key, I would ve won many more rounds for my team. Don't turn a three-on-one into a series of one-on-ones. This is the one I ve started to preach most to players that I solo queue in Competitive mode with. It s easy to take a round win for granted when you re in a 3-on-1 or a 4-on-2. The easiest way to give away an easy win, though, is arranging your team in a way that the enemy can encounter you one at a time, on their own terms. When you re defending a bombsite against a shorthanded enemy, your goal should be to guarantee a trade: put the enemy in a position where they must cross the firing line of Player B if they want to kill Player A. Are you afraid of your own pistol, or something? Pistols have an amazing amount of utility in CS:GO. In the current build, the CZ75 the only automatic pistol has a ludicrous amount of value as a short-range, spray-and-hope-for-the-best gun when your AWP isn t cutting it or your M4A1-S runs dry. Even with the recent change to price it at $500, the cost of two grenades, it s a strong backup for serial AWPers who fear being rushed. Dude, why would you ever crouch-walk? This is ancient, ancient advice, but it s something that I still occasionally see players doing on casual servers. Crouch-walking around a corner will always grant advantage to someone who s watching that corner they ll always be able to see your gun poke out, then your knees, and blast you before you see them. If you need to check around an object, shoulder peek: dart out of cover while revealing as little of yourself as possible, then back in as quickly as possible, purely to see where an enemy is.",

        "contents": "As we consider what will be included in the next big Operation, we wanted to talk a bit about community made maps and how they are selected. The CS:GO workshop community has generated a ton of custom made maps of increasingly high quality. We're currently in our fourth Operation, and so far Operations have featured a total of 21 unique community made maps. On average, each community map has earned over $23,000, per Operation it was featured in. Deciding which maps are included in an Operation involves much consideration of several distinct criteria. Every map is considered and evaluated on its own individual merits. The final decision is made by carefully weighing each of the following contributing factors: Theme / Aesthetic Quality Maps should succeed at bringing players into the game by presenting an attractive and visually appealing space. Strong aesthetic quality should make players happy to spend time in the map, independent of gameplay considerations. This criteria may include a cohesive theme for the map, or a consistent style that helps players fulfill a fantasy. A good-looking map with a high level of polish that matches the quality of the official maps is a requirement, but a map with an interesting or unique core theme with spaces that feel like a real place, is of significant value. Our goal is not to dismiss any map out of hand, but rather to ensure that Operations include great-looking maps with consistent aesthetic quality. Gameplay / Fun / Retention If great visuals bring players in, great gameplay gets them to stay. When players are challenged or are having fun on a map, they will choose to play on the map over and over again. This is called Player Retention and is achieved by creating a map that is balanced, has lots of opportunities for a player/team to learn new strategies, develop new skills or have fun, new experiences. Ideally we want CS:GO’s maps to enjoy extended popularity due to strong gameplay even after the initial fantasy has waned. This will ensure that a map will stick around and keep players happy for a long time. Maps that don’t objectively meet these criteria will score poorly in this area. Playtime / Interest Community play time for workshop maps is a primary driving factor for determining map popularity, but community interest also plays a factor. Interest is a combination of a bunch of components including workshop ratings and community discussion, but (if applicable) we value how many people are currently playing a map and how much they play it as the most important factor in this category. The Playtime / Interest category is considered a wildcard category for us and will multiply the value of the first two categories, but can't make up for a map that scores very low in them. Maps that excel in all three categories have a higher likelihood of being included in an Operation. FAQ My map wasn’t selected for this Operation, is it possible it’ll make it into a future operation? Yes. If a map meets the bar on the criteria above, but did not get selected, it is still eligible to be included in future operations. Will my map be considered for an Operation if it is not uploaded to the workshop? No. Maps need to be on the CS:GO workshop to be considered in an Operation. Additionally, they need to be in a “shippable” state before Valve make the map picks for the upcoming Operation. Ideally, the map has also been played a bunch by the community and has gone through a lot of rounds of feedback and iteration. But if it meets the bar and was submitted to the workshop on time, why wasn't it selected? When the group of maps are selected for an Operation, the maps are selected so that they work as a collection. Our goal is to provide a collection of strong maps that have good gameplay variety and unique visuals that appeal to different groups of people. If your map meets the bar, but wasn't selected, it may have not fit well with the group selected and will be considered next time. How important is “theme” in a map? We consider theme to be very important. We tend to see a lot of maps that all have similar themes (warehouses, generic industrial, generic factories, etc) or maps that tend to heavily share themes with maps we’ve already shipped. Creating a map with a unique theme will help your map stand out to the community and will increase your chances of getting noticed/selected. Will non-Classic (arms race, demolition etc.) maps ever be included in an Operation? There are a lot of great non-Classic maps on the Workshop and we’re working on ways to include them in future Operations while still generating enough revenue for the map authors, but for now, we’re only including maps that support Classic modes. What’s more important: New and novel features or tried and true familiar gameplay? The short answer is that they are both equally important and different types players will value them differently. Players who have been playing for a long time have built up a lot of skills and expectations and playing a map that feels “familiar” to them is very important. But on the other hand, there are a lot of players who value new experiences which they can share with their friends and have fun. Producing a map that is both new and incorporates familiar things from classic maps is a good goal when producing a map.",

        "contents": "The CS:GO workshop community constantly amazes us with weapon finishes and stickers of increasingly high quality. We have currently shipped over 70 weapon submissions made by the community and all together, CS:GO weapon finish creators have earned over $3 million, with each finish earning over $40,000 on average. Since shipping the first community case, we've gathered and responded to a variety of contributor questions. Common questions include \"how do I get my submission in a case?\", and \"what can I do better to get my work noticed?\". These are useful questions to answer for all contributors, so we've outlined our answers in the form of contributor tips below: Tips for Contributors Submit only high quality designs that were made by you. The entirety of the submission must be your creation; no clip art. It must be original content and if the work is the result of collaboration then every contributor must be listed in the contributor revenue share. The designs that you submit must be of high quality in execution. Showing your process is a great way to stand out and demonstrate the quality and originality of your work. For weapon finishes, consider making finishes for weapons that have few high quality submissions. Some weapons don’t have a lot of high quality finishes submitted for them (Duel Berettas and Negev for example). Making high quality original finishes for those weapons is great way to stand out and increase you chances of making it into a case. Keep in mind each item in a case gets an equal share of the revenue. Vary the techniques, themes and finish types, and try to experiment with new ones. When putting together cases and capsules we look for items that vary in technique and theme. Technique is the type of artwork that is used. Graphic patterns and hand painted designs are examples of different techniques. Example for themes would be finishes that look Sci-fi or Military. If you are making finishes for a particular weapon you may want to make one with a technique or theme that is under-represented, or hasn't been attempted yet. Certain types of finishes are also underrepresented in the workshop. In particular finishes that allow for flexibility in the way a pattern is applied to a weapon. These offer players a chance to get a unique version of a weapon finish. Don't fixate on bold designs. Cases and capsules also contain designs that vary in saturation and contrast. Currently on the workshop we see many high contrast highly saturated designs. These designs can be identified from a distance but equally important are designs that are subtle enough to only be noticed when held, as different players have different preferences when it comes to broadcasting their weapon finish choice. Try making designs that vary in saturation and contrast. Sometimes making a subtle design is actually harder than a bold one. Don't forget about popularity. Getting your finish upvoted and noticed is a great way to demonstrate desirability and collect feedback that will help you iterate on it. One of the factors we use to gauge community interest is the popularity of a submission. Hopefully this information is helpful when you are making decisions on what to work on. We look forward to seeing even more amazing work from the CS:GO Community.",

These offer players a chance to get a unique version of a weapon finish. Don't fixate on bold designs. Cases and capsules also contain designs that vary in saturation and contrast. Currently on the workshop we see many high contrast highly saturated designs. These designs can be identified from a distance but equally important are designs that are subtle enough to only be noticed when held, as different players have different preferences when it comes to broadcasting their weapon finish choice. Try making designs that vary in saturation and contrast. Sometimes making a subtle design is actually harder than a bold one. Don't forget about popularity. Getting your finish upvoted and noticed is a great way to demonstrate desirability and collect feedback that will help you iterate on it. One of the factors we use to gauge community interest is the popularity of a submission. Hopefully this information is helpful when you are making decisions on what to work on. We look forward to seeing even more amazing work from the CS:GO Community.",

Not like that. Tim Clark: What kept you, Snake? I m mostly not much one for boss battles, but the fight with The End from Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is, by a distance, my favourite. It s funny, tense and startlingly creative essentially everything that s good about Hideo Kojima s stealth series. Kojima s detractors inevitably point to his narrative excess and his games debatable interactivity but, honestly, screw that noise. Metal Gear Solid V coming to PC, in the form of both The Phantom Pain and its Ground Zeroes prelude, is great news. As Tyler pointed out in his rousing piece earlier this week, this is an interesting, systems-based game running on a powerful engine. The PC version will likely be the definitive one. Now we just need Konami to confirm P.T. next... Phil Savage: Craving curation Steam is changing. Today saw the release of some new library upgrades, and, thanks to the dataminers of SteamDB, we've got an idea of the upcoming improvements to the service's store. This is all good news. Few things this week excited me more than realising I can now select multiple games in my Steam library. No, don't look at me like that. I own a lot of games and have a need to categorise them all. Okay, fine, the potential store changes are more notable. Specifically, the idea of following individual and group curators for personalised front pages. It's a necessary move the continued sale of games like Air Control proves that Valve aren't interested in running a curated platform. Here's the thing: they never were. For years, they allowed unmitigated shit onto the store because they had deals in place with the publishers who shat them. Being on Steam is not, and has never been, a guarantee of quality. But being on the recommendations list of some reliable curators could be. Tyler Wilde: Shadow Realms Last week, I was griping about BioWare s live action You ve Been Chosen teasers. I m skeptical of any game revealed by not telling us what the game is. This week, however, we ve all begun forgetting about the teasers in favor of having thoughts about Shadow Realms, the game they were teasing. And Shadow Realms sounds pretty cool. It s a 4v1 episodic RPG, where the one is the Shadowlord, who s essentially a dungeon master. The Shadowlord attempts to stop the party haunting them, setting traps, casting spells, summoning monsters, and controlling any monster in the level.\" And despite last week s cryptic marketing, which usually suggests there s nothing real to show, alpha invites are going out next month. Find out more in our interview with BioWare Austin General Manager Jeff Hickman. Samuel Roberts: Metal Gear? It can t be! I have to echo Tim s enthusiasm for Metal Gear Solid V coming to PC I m a huge fan of that series and I ve completed all of them multiple times (except MGS4, since life s slightly too short for me to sit through its ludicrous hour-long closing cutscene again). I now want Konami to take it further. Some PC players would like an education on Metal Gear and why it s been so critically and commercially successful on consoles for such a long period of time. Konami already ported the original to PC years ago. Why not bring it out on Steam? Likewise, a few years ago, Konami employed port specialists BluePoint to remake MGS2 (eh), MGS3 (amazing) and PeaceWalker (very odd, but with a lot of connections to MGSV). MGSV is a great start from Konami, and I m glad it s not being seen as an afterthought release-wise like Revengeance was, but I think re-releasing the older games on PC could see that series be even bigger on Steam than it is on consoles. As Andy pointed out a few months ago, Metal Gear Solid has always belonged on PC. Evan Lahti: Go, go, go! I m so happy to see CS:GO gaining more popularity as an e-sport. On Thursday, during only the group stages (the seeding rounds) of the ESL One championship in Cologne, Cloud9 s match against Titan peaked at 270,000 concurrent viewers. Those aren t Dota 2 or League of Legends numbers, of course, but that figure exceeds what CS:GO drew during the grand finals of its last tournament. Valve made some improvements to CS:GO s spectating experience in a recent patch, and its comment during The International indicates that they might be throwing more of their support behind the game on most days the second-most popular on Steam in the future. It s inherently tougher for FPSes to catch on as e-sports because perspective-swapping between players isn t necessarily a great experience, especially for non-players, but continued support from Valve would have a huge impact on the scene. Tom Senior: Rise of the PC PCs are everywhere at Gamescom. They're pushing Ryse to 4K monitors in Crytek's booth, rendering 4 vs. 1 battles in Evolve and Shadow Realms. They're powering Firaxis' Civ: Beyond Earth demoes, sitting under tables in Paradox' booths and enabling huge League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive contests on the show floor. The Metal Gear Solid 5 announcement is the big news of the week, but it's symptomatic of the quiet ascendency of a platform that wasn't taken seriously by some publishers five or six years ago. There are a few holdouts, sure. I reckon Rise of the Tomb Raider will make it over late, and we may never see a PC version of Destiny, but these instances are proving increasingly rare. Hopefully in future, if we're lucky, we'll see more simultaneous PC/console releases for more big budget games, but let's not go too crazy. THE LOWS Samuel Roberts: Gamescom blues Gamescom is like the local/mid-term elections in the realm of trade shows. If you re a journalist or one of the thousands of people being squashed in Cologne, I m sure it s delightful, as the show is notably better for access than it is for news but from the outside looking in, it felt like a bit of a non-starter for announcements outside of the great news about Metal Gear (I also share Tim s love of The End, MGS3 s astonishing boss battle), the reveal of Shadow Realms from BioWare and the Tomb Raider thing that pissed absolutely everyone off (even though the whole thing might be a timed exclusive it s pretty hard to work that bit out). A bunch of EA titles that probably should ve made an appearance Star Wars: Battlefront, Mirror s Edge, any of the other BioWare games in production didn t, meaning it ll likely be another ten months before we get even a whisper out of them again. If you re at home watching out for Gamescom announcements, I can t imagine it was nearly as exciting as the E3 shows were. There s plenty to look forward to in the rest of 2014 and early 2015, but for actual new things, it was kind of quiet. Tom Senior: Gamescom attendees deserve a little more Three hundred thousand people bought tickets and stormed the Koelnmesse this week, and many queue for a long time to be ushered into a theatre and shown some trailers at ear splitting volume. Ticket holders deserve a chance to catch some advanced access for their cash, so here's a shout-out to the developers who put playable builds on the show floor this year. Often games aren't ready for mass consumption in the wild conditions of a conference hall, but when you walk past rows and rows of packed-out Fifa kiosks every day it's clear how much that exclusive access matters to people. People were even enjoying a few battles in PIllars of Eternity in one noisy corner of Hall 9. I can only admire their powers of concentration. Tyler Wilde: Rise of the Tomb Raider is an Xbox exclusive I don t care much about exclusivity deals that keep games off the Xbox One or PS4 (though I m sure I would if I owned one or the other), but when the PC gets lumped in? And by Microsoft? It makes me feel unwanted, alienated. Why can t you just be an Xbox gamer? As I argued earlier this week, Square Enix might be getting a good deal by making Rise of the Tomb Raider a timed Xbox exclusive, but I m still disappointed whenever risk abatement involves withholding games. I get it, though. Developing games is expensive and any way to help ensure success is welcome. But for the brave, a lot of money can be made on the PC, and I fear console-focused publishers will never have a chance to figure it out amid their exclusivity deals and pre-order bonuses. The response to making less money on PC, where there are no discs to print, no used games, and long-term promotion, should be to solve it. Oh, also, hey Microsoft, I d buy a PS4 before an Xbox One, so seriously, don t worry about keeping games off the PC. It won t help anyway. Phil Savage: Exclusively empty I get that words change their meaning over time. This is a natural and healthy part of the evolution of language. But sometimes evolution goes wrong. This has happened to the word exclusive . It hasn't changed its meaning; it's lost its meaning. It is meaningless a carcass of a word that rots the sentence that it's dumped in. I watched Gamescom's console press conferences in a state of constant confusion. The word exclusive was deployed in so many ways, for so many scenarios, and none of them applied to what the word should mean. Even worse was the phrase first on console for Xbox/Playstation, which was liberally spat out for games already on PC. The phrasing is deliberately ambiguous. It can be read in multiple ways, but specifically applies to one. If a core part of your business strategy is to mislead your customers through empty phrasing, you are doing something wrong. Tim Clark: A beastly problem Just when I thought I couldn t QQ any harder about the seemingly endless stream of Zoo players in Hearthstone this week s highlight: queuing into five straight Zoos in casual back come the bloody Hunters. Between the Webspinner and Haunted Creeper, the Hunter class already had its early game bolstered by the new Naxxramas cards, but with the arrival of the secret-spawning Mad Scientist this week the class is now likely out of control again. Hey, you like playing against secrets right? Wait and see how much you like playing against opponents who don t even have to pay any Mana for them. The salt is strong with me. Evan Lahti: Steam needs an overhaul Steam updates constantly, but the design of the client itself has remained almost untouched for at least a few years. SteamDB sniffed out an upcoming update to Steam, but it only seems to address a few piecemeal issues rather than being a skin-to-bones reimagining of the program, which I think Steam desperately needs. The glut of indie games, DLC, Workshop content, and software that s flooded Steam in the past few years has rendered the store page and other corners of the program less useful; it s unlikely that tweaking Steam s lame tags system or adding a discovery queue will address Steam s fundamental problem: there s too much stuff, and it isn t meaningfully organized.

Following Katowice earlier this year, the ESL Championship begins 3 AM Eastern on Thursday, the first matches of ESL One Cologne 2014 will kick off in Germany, culminating in a final match on Sunday. Here s the full ESL One Cologne tournament schedule. 16 teams are competing for a $250,000 prize pool, with favorites like NiP, Dignitas, and Virtus.pro matched against challengers, as the ESL teams page puts it, like Copenhagen Wolves, NaVi, and iBuypower. Thursday s matches will determine the seeding of these teams within their four-team groups, with Saturday quarterfinals preceding the semi and grand finals on Sunday. Earlier this week, Valve patched CS:GO to improve the in-client spectating experience a little, allowing you to natively view the game from the perspective of the match s caster. There s also a new camera transition animation that makes swapping between different players perspectives less disorienting. On Twitch, matches should appear on the ESLTV_CS channel. As has been the case for other events, watching tournament matches in-game or with a Steam-linked Twitch account gives you a chance of collecting special in-game items.",

Following the release of Counter-Strike Online 2 a couple of years ago, Nexon has announced another entry in the series and, naturally, it's themed around zombies. Free-to-play multiplayer FPS Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies will be heading to Steam this Summer/Autumn. It seems that Zombies will mix more traditional CS game modes such as Hostage Rescue and Bomb Diffusion with new ones that will shove zombies in as well. These modes haven't been detailed yet, but Counter-Strike Online's Left 4 Dead-like Zombie Darkness mode might hold a few clues. Valve's Doug Lombardi can hardly contain his excitement: Today we are announcing the latest creation from Nexon in the Counter-Strike world, one that builds upon years of success in developing CS Online for Asia. This title showcases that work in new, zombie, and classic form. Here's hoping Nexon goes the whole hog and chucks in a Portal gun and TF2 characters for their next Counter-Strike game. Zombies is out soonish, and unlike Counter-Strike Online, you'll be able to find this one on Steam.",

They are better at Counter-Strike than, say, you (even though I'm sure you are really good). That's why, for the upcoming ESL One Cologne 2014 CS:GO Championship, Valve have arranged a system in which the pros get to play Counter-Strike, and you get to play with stickers. The Cologne 2014 Pick'Em Challenge event lets you predict the winning teams of each ESL One match. It's a bit like gambling, only there's no money involved. Or, more accurately, there is money involved, but all of it goes to Valve. To pick a team, you'll need an unused sticker available from in-game sticker capsules, or from the Steam Marketplace. Once used, each sticker will be locked for the day, but can be reused for future matches. Do well, and you can earn a Pick'Em Challenge trophy for your Steam profile. Also, the knowledge that you're really good at determining who's really good at Counter-Strike. Valve have more plans for the event, which they'll be announcing soon.",

It's no surprise, given Dota 2's Steam domination. So it only makes sense that Valve should consider the same treatment for some of its other properties. Obviously, a Counter-Strike international tournament would not go astray. Speaking in a video interview with Prodota.ru, Valve's Erik Johnson indicated that the company is giving serious thought to the possibility. I don t know if it would be called The International, but the guys working on Counter-Strike made a lot of progress on supporting the professional community around that game, Johnson said. We all work at the same company and share a lot of ideas, and given how successful this tournament has become I don t see any reason why a lot of the same things couldn't be applied directly to Counter-Strike. Johnson didn't confirm outright, of course, but it seems a no-brainer that Valve should instate a similar competition for the enduring tactical shooter: it had 9 million players as of April. An impressive number for sure, but nonetheless dwarved by Dota 2's 26 million. Thanks Gamespot. &nbsp;",

With caveats made for its flaws (64-tick servers, uninspiring stat tracking, the modest number of official maps, and imperfect cheat detection), CS:GO is the best competitive FPS on PC today. Until Evolve or Rainbow Six Siege come around, I expect that to continue uncontested. But for the veteran player, someone who s thrown hundreds of hours at that competitive mode, a CS:GO Steam sale like today s $7.49 / 5.99 until Friday isn t a happy event. It s a harbinger of hackers and competition-souring smurf accounts. CS:GO s price drop is an invitation for those who hack to buy one or several new copies of the game and tie them to new, unique Steam accounts. These secondary accounts insulate your main profile where you keep your game library and everything else that s valuable from the consequences of cheating. We ve recently investigated the seemingly healthy shadow industry of cheating in games like CS:GO, but it s worth underlining how especially disruptive cheating is in the second-most popular game on Steam. What s challenging about hacking in CS:GO is that much of the onus is on the players to report and police themselves, but competitive play makes it inherently difficult or time-consuming to verify a hacker. Naturally, you re not allowed to spectate an opponent mid-match, so if I want to be sure that someone s playing illegitimately, I have to be mad enough to take the time to stop playing, load up my match replay, scrutinize my opponent s actions, report them, and then just trust that the system will catch them. There s no immediate judgment or verification that you caught a hacker; users that receive enough reports, to my understanding, are simply passed along to CS:GO s Overwatch system, where a player (who s recorded at least 150 wins in competitive mode) watches excerpts of the match and makes a judgment. Reporting a hacker is like calling a 911 line that cannot talk back to you. It s an unsatisfying system even when it works, and I m upset knowing that CS:GO s sale will invite more abusers into the system. You also can t simply leave a match to avoid subjecting yourself to a hacker. Abandoning a match for any reason penalizes you, preventing you from playing competitive mode for a period for days at a time, for frequent offenders. But smurf accounts, at least from my experience, are the lesser but more ubiquitous annoyance that a discounted CS:GO stimulates. To the seasoned competitive player, the signs of a smurf are much more obvious than a hacker: you look for a CS:GO profile with very few achievements unlocked or custom weapon skins equipped, tied to a Steam account with CS:GO as its only owned game ( Wow, such dedication. So hardcore, I usually type mockingly when I encounter one of these players). Having one or more smurfs in your match is more subtle disruption but often just as bothersome as hacking: smurf accounts don t receive a rank in the matchmaking system until they ve won 10 games, allowing them to be matched with players that aren t at their true skill level. It s a method of circumventing the matchmaking system (often as a way to play with friends who aren t near the same rank), one not unfamiliar to League of Legends players and other free-to-play games. When I m up against such a player, there s no tool within the reporting system for me to flag their account and why should there be? As far as Valve s concerned, that player is another legitimate customer. Solutions like IP banning would be over-aggressive: what if that account is legitimately a friend or sibling? I want to see the CS:GO community grow, but I bemoan that the game I play most going on sale will probably mean that I'll encounter a few more cheaters and rank-dodging players in the next month or two. To give Valve credit, this isn t the cheapest we ve seen CS:GO. In December, January, and March (the latter coinciding with the EMS One Katowice tournament in Poland), the game was slashed by 75% to just $3.74. The 50% cut over the next two days may be a small compromise, but I don't doubt that it'll invite more players to circumvent matchmaking and play illegitimately.",

We're feverish from the savings, but it would be madness to stop saving now. Today's deals fuel our appetite for strategy, shooting, and launching valiant little green men into space on absurdly oversized rockets. Don t forget to check out GOG s summer deals, too. Reminder: if a game isn't a daily deal or a flash sale, it could pop up later in the sale for an even lower price. If you want to be safe, wait until June 30 to pick up a sale-long deal. 5 - The Banner Saga 50% off: $12.49 / 9.49 - Steam store page One of the biggest artistic achievements in gaming this year. We love The Banner Saga s hand-drawn characters and how they animate on the battlefield, but we especially enjoy the way its detailed, Nordic landscapes parallax as your caravan of warriors and survivors march on. The Austin Wintory score is a cherry on the top. 4 - Kerbal Space Program 40% off: $16.19 / 11.99 - Steam store page We ve murdered a lot of aliens in games, but only in KSP have we stranded little green guys in planetary orbit due to our grossly incompetent management of a budding space program. The Early Access rocket physics simulator is one of the best games still under development, and already has a large community of engineers sharing stories of harrowing space missions, ship designs, and mods. KSP has even made its way into classrooms. Read Ian s five-part Kerbal Space Program chronicle to see how he learned rocket-building basics and launched a mission to the M n. 3 - Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 50% off: $7.49 / 5.99 - Steam store page The best competitive FPS on PC owes a lot to its skill-based matchmaking format. At any skill level, five-on-five Counter-Strike narrows the range of tactical choices available to you and the time you have to make them, creating a wonderfully concentrated competitive mode. Otherwise, CS:GO is mainly a vehicle for microtransactions: beware the allure of $400 virtual knives. 2 - Tomb Raider 75% off: $4.99 / 3.74 - Steam store page Flash sale: Buy it before 8 p.m. EST Lara Croft returns in a gorgeous action game heavily inspired by Naughty Dog's Uncharted series. This younger, rebooted Lara doesn't have her predecessor's confidence or predilection for interesting puzzles the only tombs in this game are disappointingly short and simple but the shooting is by far the best in the series. Exploring Tomb Raider's island and crafting survival gear is also fun, as Lara is a nimble climber and each area is packed with interesting treasures to hunt down. For a challenge, forgo the assault rifle and grenade launcher for Lara's incredibly satisfying (and silent!) bow. 1 - BioShock Triple Pack 83% off: $10.19 / 6.79 - Steam store page If you haven t explored the ruins of Rapture, you re in for a treat. BioShock s world is a revelation, an under-the-sea society that s crumbled under its own weight, and exploring what remains of it and shooting its crazy inhabitants in the face with fireballs is a delight. BioShock 2 goes even further, changing your perspective and adding a surprising amount of depth with its own story. Irrational s swansong, BioShock Infinite, may still be polarizing, but Columbia is just as beautiful and terrifying as Rapture, and well worth exploring. All three are included here in a bundle that s too cheap to pass up. Other great deals today Remember that games not categorized as Daily Deals or Flash Sales may be reduced further later in the sale. Bastion (40% off) $8.99 / 6.59 Killing Floor (50% off) $9.99 / 7.49 Mirror's Edge (75% off) $4.99 / 2.49 Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition (66% off) $6.79 / 5.09",

By design, the Items Workshop has very low friction for artists to submit their work – new contributions do not require Valve review or approval. To ensure that these contributions represent original content, we require that all Workshop contributors sign a legal agreement confirming that their contributions are original. We also enable the community to monitor Workshop submissions and identify copies and plagiarism via the report flag. All contributors share joint responsibility for the originality of their Workshop submission, and therefore share joint liability for claims of copyright infringement. That is, if two or more artists collaborate on a submission and the submission contains intellectual property that isn’t their own, all artists involved in the submission will share in the consequences. For the items in question, the following steps have been taken: Both contributors have received Steam Community bans. They receive no proceeds from either item, and both items have been removed from the game. For owners of the M4A4 | Howl and Howling Dawn sticker, those items have been replaced by an alternative designed by the CS:GO team. These items will never be produced again, and have been assigned the ‘Contraband’ rarity. All other in-game items that involve at least one of the contributors in their revenue share have been discontinued. The Huntsman Case and Community Sticker Capsule have been revised to replace the copied and discontinued items. Moving forward, we will no longer work with the contributors and we will not ship any existing Workshop submission that credits their involvement. The cost for everyone involved in the resolution of this issue has been significant, including our players and community members.

In one of my dozen-some competitive matches (CS:GO s excellent five-on-five matchmaking mode), I noticed that one of my opponents was livestreaming. After we won, we booted up the archived video together, commenting in Mumble as we watched. It was a rare chance for my CS:GO group and I to see ourselves through an opponent s eyes (and comms) what did it look like to play against us? These were my takeaways. Here's the replay file of the match, if you're into that: steam://rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo_download_match%20CSGO-X8bCn-P5Cmw-MBvNv-naDSf-YYmQD My mental picture of my opponents is completely wrong I ve won 107 competitive matches. My rank swings between Master Guardian II and Master Guardian Elite, which places me at the outer edge of average. At that level, 13th rank out of a possible 18, I expect a basic set of skills from opponents: Comprehensive map knowledge Smart money management Good marksmanship, anticipation, audio awareness For the most part, our opponents had all of this. They won both pistol rounds against us (and the two eco rounds that followed). Their accuracy was good. Their rotations were a little slow on defense, but big deal. I tend to assume, perhaps as a defense mechanism, perhaps out of insecure cowardice, that everyone I play a competitive game against is better than me. But watching the game from their perspective revealed a bunch of bad decisions and impulsive decision-making, stuff that s invisible to me when I m not looking through the eyes of my enemy. At 7:15 the livestreaming player walks through smoke with a grenade pulled and dies; at 7:30 his teammate walks through the same smoke and dies. At 8:30 they again walk through smoke together to bombsite B. In round 13, down 8-4 (absolutely not an insurmountable deficit for the Terrorist side they actually tie it 9-9 after switching to CT), and with $7700 in the bank, he buys an armor, a Desert Eagle, and a decoy grenade. Round 14, their plan is to rush through smoke on B, which they bicker over a bit before clumsily committing to. Second round, second half, he buys a Scout after winning the pistol round. But beyond those avoidable mistakes... how can I put it? Over my hundreds of hours in competitive mode, some portion of which has involved being taunted and called a long list of creative insults, I d painted this image of my hypothetical opponent being a hardcore, misanthropic, snarking, probably-racist with a chip their shoulder. In reality, I was playing against someone barely out of their adolescence, 32-ounce Jamba Juice cup perpetually in-hand, who listens to EDM mid-match, and whose mom at one point barges in on him. Late in the match, presumably bored or having given up, he goes AFK multiple times to text on his phone. I haven t showered in two days, he confesses at 5:09. Hackers are everywhere, but maybe it doesn t matter Even after our recent investigation, it s tough to say just how prevalent hacking is in CS:GO based on my own anecdotal evidence, but there s certainly enough distrust swirling around competitive play to make it unpleasant. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but the reality is that the inability to spectate your opponents mid-match leaves a lot of room for suspicion, especially because most hacks can be toggled on or off at will. So you look for signals, like a Steam profile with a miniscule amount of hours-played, no weapon skins, or that only owns CS:GO all evidence that signifies a smurf account but even in cases where someone s openly hacking there isn t anything you can do in the context of your match apart from outplaying them. What was illuminating about this match, though, was how quickly the other team was convinced that one of us were hacking as one of them are openly talking about activating their own hacks. At 16:30, Vagabond makes a disgusting AWP shot on bombsite B after another clutch pick on construction. Instantly, the livestreamer reports him. Later: 22:30 Vagabond s walling. He s retarded for walling on his main account. 26:40 Vagabond and Tetharis, you guys are fucking hacking c****. Sprinkled throughout, you can hear them talking openly about hacking: 21:20 Wait, so you re walling? Yeah, how do you think we won that? 38:30 Down 9-13, one of them says I m gonna have to toggle again, I don t know if we re gonna win. Had these guys just accepted hacking as a necessary evil in CS:GO? It was genuine surprise to learn that one of them were cheating, and it s annoying that there s no way I can report them after the fact, but should I care? We won pretty comfortably, by CS:GO standards. Are way more people hacking than I suspect, and I just don t notice because it doesn t have a significant impact on that match? Either way, it supports my concern that at least some people are using CS:GO s reporting system out of spite and paranoid suspicion, and not with the restraint they should. Above: Vagabond makes a bold, patient play on de_nuke. ...We re not terrible? It s so easy, at least for me, to doubt and understate your skill level in competitive games. Matchmaking is designed to put you up against people about as good or better than you, and that experience, for me at least, tends to hide a lot of the actual learning and progress I make because you're so concerned with playing to the level of your opponent. My group still makes plenty of mistakes, and I m constantly unhappy about how inconsistent my rifle accuracy is, but at this point in our CS:GO amateur careers I can see that we ve eliminated so many bad habits that we had two months ago. Our positioning is consistent, but we know when to juggle our tactics to avoid being predictable. We don t give up on rounds. We don't crouch-walk around corners. We can read and recognize when a grenade toss signifies a rush-feint. We have an understanding of each other s strengths and comfort zones. I know that drgmatt plays apartments on de_inferno with a P90, while Tetharis and Caesar like to play B with M4s. I love our flash on apartments at 37:27. I m proudest of our comms, which are so much cleaner and abbreviated than our opponents . Our callouts are quick and to the point, respectful of the need to listen for footsteps and grenade clinks. Hearing opponents vocalize reactions to our plays was really valuable. CS:GO s built-in replay tool ( Watch on the main menu) doesn t archive any voice audio from matches, of course, but considering how quickly rounds come and go in Counter-Strike, it s still a terrific tool for understanding why you won or lost.",

The tool lets you build a crosshair dynamically, then spits out the corresponding console commands for you to paste in-game or into an autoexec file. After 416 hours spent in CS:GO I can't believe it took me this long to stumble on this. Skarbo's web tool has actually been around in various forms for a year-plus, but @lordstreetguru kindly pointed us in its direction after having a look at our CS:GO tweaks guide. CS:GO does, of course, have an in-game settings section for fiddling with your crosshair and other UI elements, but it doesn't give you full control. Below, a few useful and completely dumb crosshairs I built: Static cyan dot cl_crosshairalpha \"255\";cl_crosshaircolor \"4\";cl_crosshaircolor_b \"0\";cl_crosshaircolor_r \"0\";cl_crosshaircolor_g \"255\";cl_crosshairdot \"1\";cl_crosshairgap \"0\";cl_crosshairsize \"0\";cl_crosshairstyle \"2\";cl_crosshairusealpha \"1\";cl_crosshairthickness \"2\";cl_fixedcrosshairgap \"0\";cl_crosshair_outline \"0\";cl_crosshair_outline_draw \"0\"; White, semi-transparent large cross, dynamic, foolish cl_crosshairalpha \"118\";cl_crosshaircolor \"5\";cl_crosshaircolor_b \"255\";cl_crosshaircolor_r \"255\";cl_crosshaircolor_g \"255\";cl_crosshairdot \"1\";cl_crosshairgap \"-5\";cl_crosshairsize \"53\";cl_crosshairstyle \"2\";cl_crosshairusealpha \"1\";cl_crosshairthickness \"3.5\";cl_fixedcrosshairgap \"-5\";cl_crosshair_outline \"0\";cl_crosshair_outline_draw \"0\"; Blocky, weird blue dynamic dot thing cl_crosshairalpha \"255\";cl_crosshaircolor \"3\";cl_crosshaircolor_b \"0\";cl_crosshaircolor_r \"0\";cl_crosshaircolor_g \"255\";cl_crosshairdot \"1\";cl_crosshairgap \"0\";cl_crosshairsize \"2\";cl_crosshairstyle \"2\";cl_crosshairusealpha \"1\";cl_crosshairthickness \"4\";cl_fixedcrosshairgap \"0\";cl_crosshair_outline \"0\";cl_crosshair_outline_draw \"0\"; GeT_RiGhT's green static crosshair (a selectable option in Skarbo's tool) cl_crosshairalpha \"255\";cl_crosshaircolor \"4\";cl_crosshaircolor_b \"0\";cl_crosshaircolor_r \"0\";cl_crosshaircolor_g \"255\";cl_crosshairdot \"1\";cl_crosshairgap \"0\";cl_crosshairsize \"0\";cl_crosshairstyle \"2\";cl_crosshairusealpha \"1\";cl_crosshairthickness \"2\";cl_fixedcrosshairgap \"0\";cl_crosshair_outline \"0\";cl_crosshair_outline_draw \"0\";",

Even after a decade half of history with the franchise, we still love the look and feel of its classic maps and their modern iterations: Mirage's A bombsite, Inferno's \"banana\" path, or Dust 2's dim tunnel. Firing up CS:GO on LPC, I decided not to go with a triple-wide monitor setup, so I arranged our three 27\" monitors in portrait configuration. This gave us a combined resolution of 4320x2560 or 25 percent/3 million more pixels than we'd get at 4K. .@wesleyfenlon has fired up Next Car Game on our ludicrous 3x27&quot; portrait setup. https://t.co/JYOJGYvSdr&mdash; Evan Lahti (@ELahti) May 9, 2014 Click each preview image to view the uncropped, uncompressed PNG.

A classic move is to knife your enemy even when it would be wiser to shoot him with a silencer, just because you can. It s a way of saying you re confident enough you can take him to have a little fun with it, like challenging someone to a fight with one hand tied behind your back. Yesterday, the folks at GameMuscleVideos took this idea to an extreme degree by playing CS:GO with a wheel controller. Obviously, you re not going to be getting first place when you re playing with a wheel that doesn t even allow you to look up and down. The goal was simple to see if they could get anything above last place, and, amazingly, they did. I m betting that would really burn whoever did come in last if he knew, as well as anyone who was taken down by the player KILLED YOU WITH A WHEEL. With the exception of some obnoxious narration, it s a pretty funny video, if only to see that it s even possible.",

An investigation into aimbot dealers, wallhack users, and the million-dollar business of video game cheating\"> </a> Zero is a customer service representative for one of the biggest video game cheat providers in the world. To him, at first, I was just another customer. He told me that the site earns approximately $1.25 million a year, which is how it can afford customer service representatives like him to answer questions over TeamSpeak. His estimate is based on the number of paying users online at any given time, the majority of whom, like me, paid for cheats for one game at $10.95 a month. Some pay more for a premium package with cheats for multiple games. As long as there have been video games, there have been cheaters. For competitive games like Counter-Strike, battling cheaters is an eternal, Sisyphean task. In February, Reddit raised concerns about lines of code in Valve-Anti Cheat (VAC), used for Counter-Strike and dozens of other games on Steam, that looked into users DNS cache. In a statement, Gabe Newell admitted that Valve doesn't like talking about VAC because it creates more opportunities for cheaters to attack the system.\" But since online surveillance has been a damning issue lately, he made an exception. Newell explained that there are paid cheat providers that confirm players paid for their product by requiring them to check in with a digital rights management (DRM) server, similar to the way Steam itself has to check in with a server at least once every two weeks. For a limited time, VAC was looking for a partial match to those (non-web) cheat DRM servers in users DNS cache. I knew that cheats existed, but I was shocked that enough people paid for them to warrant DRM. I wanted to find out how the cheating business worked, so I became a cheater myself. That s how I found Zero. After we finished talking, he reminded me to send him the $25 I promised him. I did not at any point say anything that could possibly even suggest that I would pay him for any reason. I asked him if he meant that was something I promised him or something that I should just do. Both, he said. I also advise you not to use this information against me. That wouldn't be wise. How I became a cheating scumbag Bohemia Interactive (Arma, DayZ) believes that only 1 percent of online players are willing to spend money to cheat on top of an already expensive hobby. Even by that estimate, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive alone had a potential 25,000 cheaters out of a total of 2.5 million unique players last month. Put on your green accountant visor, add up the player-bases of all the other popular multiplayer games cheat providers are servicing (Call of Duty, Battlefield, Rising Storm), and you ll see a massively profitable market. I wanted to cheat in CS:GO. I was good, once, when I had a high school student's endless free time to pour into Counter-Strike 1.3. These days, if I can play with friends, it s fun. If I jump onto a random server I m cannon fodder. I Googled Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheats, and quickly ended up at a user-friendly cheat provider. Based on the size of its community and traffic, it s one of the biggest. I'm going to call it Ultra Cheats, a fake name, to protect the anonymity of the sources I talked to. Those sources, like Zero, have also had their online handles altered. Ultra Cheats didn't accept credit (other sites did), so I used PayPal to buy a one-month subscription for CS:GO cheats for $10.95. This gave me access to the site s VIP forums where I could talk to other members, administrators, cheat coders, and download Ultra Cheats cheat loader, which checks in with its DRM server. It also gave me access to around-the-clock technical and customer support via TeamSpeak. I followed a simple list of steps, including disabling Windows default anti-virus protection. I launched a new copy of CS:GO on a fresh Steam account belonging to Perry C. Gamble, loaded the cheat using the cheat loader, and entered a match. For the first time, I wasn't just another player, but a kind of god. The most obvious of my new superhuman abilities was spying on other players through walls. In CS:GO, wallhacking is incredibly useful. Faceoffs around corners come down to millisecond reactions. My ability to see exactly when the enemy was coming, or to know exactly where he was hiding when I was coming, was unfair to say the least. It was also super fun. Maybe the most fun I've had with Counter-Strike in years. I was finally getting kills, more than one in a round, but I wasn't crushing everyone else. It was like a little boost that got me back into my high school fighting shape. I wanted to see how far I could push it. I was paying for this. I wanted to feel powerful and get my money s worth. I turned on auto-aim, and auto-trigger, which fires your weapon automatically when you point your cursor at an enemy. I played with these options and others for a handful of matches. They didn't seem as useful as wallhacking, or they simply didn't work as well, but I was vote-kicked out of a match before I could make an educated decision. Halfway into my next match, two hours total since I started cheating, I was VAC-banned from CS:GO. Counter-terrorists win? VAC bans are usually irreversible. Perry C. Gamble would never play another match of CS:GO unless he opened another Steam account and bought another copy of the game. That s where the charm of cheating wore off for me. It was fun while it lasted, but I couldn t imagine paying another $15 for a new copy of CS:GO plus the ongoing $10.95 a month Ultra Cheats membership just to get easy kills. John Gibson, president of Tripwire Interactive (Rising Storm, Killing Floor) told me plenty of cheaters feel differently. We see a spike in hackers after we have a sale on one of our games, he said. Their last 10 Steam accounts have been banned, and the game is on sale for $3, so they ll buy 10 copies for $30 on 10 different accounts and they ll keep cheating. I told Gibson that I found that behavior mind-boggling. He isn t confused by it. He s just angry. Give me five minutes alone with a hacker or a hack writer, he laughed. That s what I think about that mindset. Newell called cheating a negative-sum game, where a minority benefits less than the majority is harmed. It s obvious Valve and other developers take the issue seriously, but talking to Gibson made me realize it s also personal. Before he would even talk to me, I had to prove that I wrote for PC Gamer. He s been burned before. One of his first experiences with a hacker was someone who pretended to be a journalist with a fake, up-to-date gaming blog. He leveraged his early access to Tripwire and other developers games to provide hacks and pirate games. He s in jail now for stealing credit card data, not cheating. &nbsp; Gibson told me that, legally, it s not worth going after sites like Ultra Cheats. Most of them are based out of Russia, China (Ultra Cheats is registered in Beijing), or other places where extradition is, in Gibson's words, questionable. At the very least, Tripwire would have to pay another lawyer in that country, making it prohibitively expensive and complicated. Criminal justice systems, perhaps understandably, aren't preoccupied with people cheating in online games. Especially when it s international, Gibson said. Then you re talking about the FBI and Interpol. If someone stole $10 million in diamonds, call them. If someone is hacking your game, they don t care. If Tripwire, Valve, or other developers want to reduce the number of cheaters, they have to do it themselves. Note that it s reduce and not eliminate. Like Newell, Gibson knows that this isn't a battle he can finish. It s like the Wild West, he said. It s more about managing the risk and hacks without inconveniencing your legitimate players too much. Tripwire s anti-cheat strategy is three-pronged. The first is technical, using both VAC and Punkbuster. This is one topic Gibson was secretive about, but he said Tripwire uses both because they handle things in different ways. \"If Tripwire, Valve, or other developers want to reduce the number of cheaters, they have to do it themselves.\" The second is being a proactive developer. When Tripwire notices a loophole, it closes it as fast as possible. When Red Orchestra 2 first launched, it didn't do a whole lot of server-side validation on hit detection. The game was plagued by hacks that allowed your machine to tell the server you shot someone in the head even when you were clear across the map. Very quickly we put up an update that basically verified, within a reasonable margin of error, that they kind of have to be where you say you shoot them at, Gibson said. If they re not, then we know that it s a hack and we ignore that shot. The third is having an engaged server admin community and giving them the tools to be the third line of defense. That s a huge thing for us, Gibson said. Hackers come in, it s obvious fairly quickly that they re hacking, the server admin bans them from the server and problem solved. Punkbuster also allows server admins to take screenshots of what players see. If the server admin captures evidence of cheating, he or she can submit the proof to PBBans, a global database of hackers, making it very difficult for that hacker to join any Punkbuster servers. This also allows server admins to pass along evidence of cheating to Tripwire, which can use the information to close more loopholes. Overall, Gibson thinks this strategy works very well. I have over 1,275 hours in Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm, he said. I ve been on a server with about two hackers in all that time. I asked him if Tripwire downloads paid cheats as part of its efforts to prevent them. We re a proactive dev, he chuckled. Infer from that what you will. Gross Income After being banned from Counter-Strike, I spent several weeks poking around the Ultra Cheats forums hoping that someone would talk to me about how the site was managed. I only got real attention once I admitted that I was writing a piece for PC Gamer. I bounced from admin to admin until I got to Slayer, Ultra Cheats manager and lead coder. Slayer didn't want to talk at first. I don t think any good for Ultra Cheats would come from this, he said. I promised him I wouldn t use any real handles or even the site s real name, and that I wanted him to respond to quotes from developers like Gibson. I suspect the notion that he d get a reaction from a game developer is what got him on board. Like Gibson, he needed confirmation that I was really writing for PC Gamer, and he was more thorough about it. I gave him my real email address and name (not Perry C. Gamble s), Twitter, and an email confirmation from an editor. Gibson was worried about hackers posing as journalists. Slayer was worried about giving legal ammunition to parties that want Ultra Cheats gone, and competing cheat providers. We set a date to talk over Skype, but when the time came Slayer wouldn t agree to a voice call, just text, because he was worried about me recording him as well as other reasons. To my surprise, he brought along another Ultra Cheats administrator, Prophet, and they d only talk to me together. I guessed that this was to keep one another from saying anything they might regret. They said part of Ultra Cheats money comes from a different site that it operates in Brazil (a huge gaming market) and reseller sites, which sell Ultra Cheats product under a different brand in exchange for a cut of sales. Slayer said that Zero s $1.25 million a year was a little inflated, but that I could come up with a rough estimate of Ultra Cheats annual revenue by gauging the size of the community. On March 20, over 2,500 members logged into the Ultra Cheats forums, almost all of whom are plainly listed as paying for standard or more expensive cheat packages. At an average of $10 per user a month, Ultra Cheats makes $300,000 a year. Add to this the fact that the forum has almost 150,000 members overall (though we don t know how many are active, paying users), the Brazil site, and resellers, and it s not hard to imagine Ultra Cheats breaking a million dollars a year. Slayer declined to share the exact number of their active users. He said coders supply cheats on the site in exchange for a cut of the sale. These vendors, as Slayer calls them, take in about half the profits of the whole operation. Both Prophet and Slayer said that they get paid enough, but not enough to quit their day jobs. More than minimum wage, they said. Customer support, technical support, and other people like Zero who help run the site get paid as well, but less. Zero didn t want to say how much he makes, but admitted that he has a day job and that free cheats attracted him to the position. I do this because I really think of the community and staff as a big family, Prophet said. The rest of the money goes to the ownership entity, which Slayer and Prophet refused to talk about in any way. All they would say is that the entity controls the PayPal account I paid (and hence all Ultra Cheats' money) and that only Slayer knows anything about it. Anything between this ownership entity and the rest of Ultra Cheats goes through him. For all I know, this ownership entity doesn t even exist and Slayer and Prophet were the actual owners. Rage cheaters and closet cheaters Gibson said that if you cheat, you always get detected eventually. After talking to cheaters, I m not sure that developers are as effective at preventing cheats as they think. According to Slayer, there are two kinds of cheaters: rage hackers and closet hackers. A rage hacker is someone who uses cheats to their fullest potential, even employing features that kill everyone on the server instantly. They're the ones you notice and hate. Zero said that if it wasn't for hacking, games wouldn't be fun. He said cheating is a rush, similar to the one he got when he used to deface websites. In life, you re always going to have rebels, he said. It s like coming up to someone and asking, 'Why do you rape or kill?' But in this case it s cheating. Since he compared cheating to the worst crimes a human can inflict on another human, I asked him if that means he thinks it s a bad thing. He didn't answer. I asked him how he would feel if he was in a game with another player who was using cheats against him. Doesn't matter to me because he s probably one of our customers, he said. Slayer agrees with Gibson that anti-cheats like VAC and Punkbuster, which work similarly to anti-virus software, are effective at catching ragers and detecting public cheats quickly. But their methods are so reverse-engineered it s not even funny, he said. Punkbuster's signature scans are easily dumped using public knowledge available on public forums. If you re smart enough and you know the methods they employ, you can get around it easily. \"In life, you re always going to have rebels. It s like coming up to someone and asking, 'Why do you rape or kill?' But in this case it s cheating.' \" Punkbuster is basically defeated, Slayer said. If I write cheats and give them away on a public forum I can have my cheat up and running in 20 seconds because I found out exactly what they detected. If I was smart I would build that into my cheat and have my cheat fix itself on the fly, which isn t a stretch. Call of Duty dropped Punkbuster for a reason. I asked Slayer why Valve, for example, doesn't download his cheats, track the server, block it, and come after him. If it wasn't obvious already, I wasn't a Computer Science major. Slayer is, and my questions amused him. You could do that, but what if I cycle my server IP every day, or every hour? Or I could reasonably and securely move DRM to the client with check on a less regular basis, or I could just spoof what VAC sees :). To be honest Emanuel, I can rent a server using a prepaid credit card via a VPN in another country and you will NEVER find who rented it. Closet hackers hide the fact that they cheat. I'm proof that cheaters do get caught Steam banned me after a little more than two hours of aggressive, blatant cheating but members of the Ultra Cheats community told me that I was simply doing it wrong. In one of the most friendly, polite exchanges I ve ever had with online strangers, especially in the gaming sphere, they gave me tips on how to cheat without being detected. Play like you re not hacking, one user who s been cheating in CS:GO with the same Steam account for over 250 hours told me. Play as you would normally, only you re able to see through walls. Act. That means don t stare at walls, don t use an aimbot (since it moves the camera erratically and results in unreasonable kills), and make sure someone kills you in every match. He also believed you re less likely to get banned if you buy in-game items and get some hours in before you start cheating. He suggested that next time, I should launch the game and let it idle for a few hours before I do anything. Another cheater suggested I practice cheating in free-to-play games. That s what I love about free games, he said. You can just keep coming back and there s nothing they can do about it. If you re a good closet hacker you also won t get caught by statistical anti-cheats like FairFight, used in Titanfall and other Electronic Arts games, or Overwatch, another, peer-review layer of CS:GO s anti-cheat strategy, where approved players view flagged replay footage and vote on whether another player was cheating. Image via free-hacks.com Tripwire closes loopholes as fast as possible, but Ultra Cheats is fast too. If a vendor s cheat stops working, Ultra Cheats stops selling it and the money stops flowing. Detected cheats come back online within hours, days at the most. And these are only the cheats that we know about. Anti-cheat can t detect what it can t get its hands on, as Slayer said. Between that and the proficient closet cheaters, I can guarantee that you ve played with way more cheaters than you think. Supply and demand If closet cheaters aren't trying to crush other players, why do they turn to cheats in the first place? Prophet started cheating so he could play with his kids. He s over 50, and suffers from a serious visual impairment. He says that without ESP (extrasensory perception), part of the wallhacking cheat that highlights enemy players with bright red boxes, he wouldn't be able to keep up. If I did not use cheats I would not be playing at all, he said. Slayer said that they've heard from a few other people with disabilities who use cheats this way. It enables them to enjoy a game like you or I would normally, without cheats, he said. But even if there weren't players with disabilities cheating to rise to a normal level of play, as Prophet calls it, the reality is some players will always feel that they want special assistance. If matchmaking worked perfectly and everyone always felt like a capable player up against equally skilled opponents, maybe there would be fewer of the closet cheaters that make Ultra Cheats a profitable business. When matchmaking works, you won't win every game, but you'll never feel dominated. It s like a friendly neighborhood basketball game. When it doesn't work, it feels like being mercilessly dunked on by LeBron James. That's not fun. Image via 47r-squad.com At that point some players dedicate a significant amount of time to get better. Others quit. A small minority turns to cheats. Even Slayer admits that what he does isn t good for games, but as long as there are enough of the latter he ll provide supply where there s demand. Ultimately, the most effective anti-cheat strategy is to make cheating feel unnecessary. That means either more sophisticated, accurate matchmaking or some kind of handicap system, which some fighting games (Street Fighter IV, Smash Bros.) already implement. Similar solutions in other games won t stop ragers. Nothing will. But they'll get caught, eventually. For closet cheaters, it might offer a legitimate way to play with others and undercut the paid cheats business. Until then, this cycle is unstoppable, as Slayer said. If we didn't do it, someone else would.",

No? Neither have I and that accomplishment is apparently just a small sand grain in the over 288 million games in Steam collections that have never felt a press of the Play button. That's a surprising figure from a new report by Ars Technica researching the most active and popular games on Steam straight from the recorded statistics of some of the platform's 75-million-strong community. Ars' method for its number flood involves sampling registered games and their played hours via profiles and their unique Steam IDs. With the help of a server for computational muscle, Ars randomly polled more than 100,000 profiles daily for two months to pull together an idea of which games see the most time on everyone's monitors. In other words, your Backlog of Shame (don't deny it, everyone has one) probably took part in some SCIENCE at some point. Exciting. Some caveats exist, though. The data Ars looked at for its research only extends back to 2009, when Steam brought in its \"hours played\" tracking system. Owned and played/unplayed games are thus slightly skewed to not account for older releases from the early noughties, and any length of time spent in offline mode wouldn't get picked up by Steam either. Still, Ars claims its results deliver a good picture of Steam gaming trends for the past five years albeit with some imperfections. Predictably, Valve's personal products stack high on the list in terms of ownership and most played hours. Dota 2 takes the crown with an estimated 26 million players who ganked faces at some point in the MOBA, but free-to-play FPS Team Fortress 2 follows closely behind with a little over 20 million users. Counter-Strike: Source rounds out the top three with nearly 9 million players, but it's also collecting dust in over 3 million libraries. As for non-Valve games, Skyrim wins in activity, barely edging out Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with 5.7 million estimated active owners. Civilization V kept 5.4 million players hooked for Just One More Turn, and Garry's Mod boasts 4.6 million budding physics artists. Want to know what the most unplayed Steam game is? It's Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, the Source tech demo given free to pretty much everyone on Steam who bought or fired up Half-Life 2. It hasn't been touched by an approximate 10.7 million players. I guess that old fisherman is feeling pretty lonely right now. My favorite stat is the total of played hours divided by game mode, more specifically the separate multiplayer clients of the Steam versions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops. The single-player campaigns for each respective title sits modestly within the mid-20-hour range, but the multiplayer side balloons well into the hundreds of hours. It's a pretty obvious indicator of where the biggest chunk of popularity resides in FPS gaming, but it's not like you wouldn't get weird looks for claiming you play Call of Duty for the story anyway. See more of Ars' results in both number and pretty orange graph form in its report.",

As Valve explains, it is the first completely new defuse map designed with competitive play in mind, and since its release in December 2013, it has been updated seven times based on feedback and data. Take for example the changes made to Bombsite A, which unlike most diffuse maps, is easier to defend from a distance. Retaking the site from the A tunnels was originally very difficult, because defenders could keep tabs on the area from many angles, Valve said in a post on the Counter Strike blog. Move the Terrorist s Target a bit so it s easier to reach from the tunnels, remove a car that was giving Counter Terrorists too much cover, and the area is completely rebalanced. The post details a few of these small but fascinating changes that went into Overpass, and highlights them with fancy, interactive before and after screenshots. It s a good read if you re into Counter-Strike or map design in general. Even better is our three part series from mapmaker Shawn \"FMPONE Snelling and pro Counter-Strike player/mapmaker Sal \"VOLCANO\" Garozzo, which reveals the inspiration and building process for their CS:GO map Crown.",

Their goal with Crown is simple: build the best competitive Counter-Strike map ever. In part three, Snelling talks about iteration in map design and listening to community feedback to improve Crown. Releasing de_crown has been a fascinating experience for Volcano and I. When we decided Crown was ready for broader community testing, we released the first public build with the same mixture of anxiety and excitement that always accompanies a new map release. Thankfully, the launch went smoothly! Crown received over 1000 favorites in its first week on the map workshop (the highest rated map on the workshop is over a year old, and has about 1500). Crown ranked within the top five maps of all time virtually overnight. Crown was also the most played map on AltPug s community Matchmaking service during that time period, and the feedback we received there was generally positive. The community was engaged, but Counter-Strike fans are used to playing high quality, nuanced maps with years of competitive polish. This is a high standard for any brand new map to compete with. Not all the news was positive. In public beta testing, several issues were identified which needed fixing, some of which such as the addition of a new path would require major surgery. Generally speaking, I find that that the most effective feedback happens during a dialogue. I like to turn players into problem solvers, since many folks already have brilliant, innovative solutions in mind which I might never have considered. As a result of one such discussion, we added a trick jump to Crown, which you can see below. This trick jump, though easy enough to implement, added a nice layer of richness to the B-Bombsite it s challenging to make the jump successfully, but will allow skilled players to go from lower B to upper B in seconds flat. What are people REALLY saying? Volcano and I participated in playtests and spectated matches anonymously in order to understand how players really felt about Crown, because people typically temper their criticism somewhat when they know they re in the same server as a map creator. We heard lots of people saying Crown felt big and too open, so we added more horizontal details at eye-level and new architectural features designed to bring the map down to scale, in addition to reducing or closing several sightlines. A lot of times, making these gameplay adjustments is positive aesthetically, too: the map feels a lot more natural now. An archway Volcano suggested We also got tons of great feedback about Crown on Reddit. A few common themes about Crown which popped up on r/globaloffensive were that the map s rotation times were too long, the lack of a middle-connector was creating static gameplay, and the map s balance seemed T-sided. It was important for us to immediately make changes to fix these issues. In many instances people took to Photoshop to actually illustrate how they wanted to see us implement the new changes (another example of how the community already has solutions in mind), and these illustrations were frequently very similar to one another, indicating that a consensus had formed. Already Pro Because Volcano is a professional Counter-Strike player in addition to being a level designer, pro feedback is cooked into Crown very deeply. I believe that Volcano and I make a great team because we know that if the other person raises an issue, that he speaks on behalf of a large segment of the community. I consider priority one of my job asking Volcano about the competitive repercussions of every design decision we initiate: leaving this window open vs. closed, the readability of this area, whether this area needs more cover, and so on. The community was widely requesting a new path cutting from middle to CT courtyard due to lengthy rotation times and Volcano also felt that this was a necessary change to make. My stance was that I was satisfied with how Crown was playing, and that proper team coordination would give CT s enough time to rotate, especially once people were more familiar with the map. Volcano didn t necessarily disagree, but he was pretty certain that the community would be happier if we implemented the change, and that not implementing the change could ultimately limit Crown s variety in competitive play. We had considered such a path early on in Crown s gray-box stage, but decided not to implement the path back then because we wanted to emphasize identifying fakes and making timely call-outs about what the Terrorists were doing. As it happened, the community didn t love the lengthened rotation times, perhaps because rotating places huge emphasis on the teamplay aspect of Counter-Strike, but truly relying on your teammates can be frustrating outside of a tournament-style setting. I personally enjoyed the way Crown was playing, but sometimes as a mapper you have to accept that your personal preference might be in the minority. Sometimes you have to give the people what they want. Because Volcano was adamant that this was the right thing to do, because shortening rotation times was going to make the community happy, and because it would positively impact gameplay for players at all skill levels (especially in less formal settings like matchmaking), we implemented the new path. View of the new path from Middle View of the new path from CT Spawn Another view of the new path from CT Spawn The Ripple Effect When major changes are made, other areas typically have to be adjusted to accommodate them. Here you can see the ripple effect the new path has already had. We received some feedback that this sniper s nest felt overly large, out of place, and sort of pointless. Adding our new path mitigated those concerns. We also needed to adjust the Armory area. We were told by Valve that Crown could benefit from some more lighting variety, and layout considerations required closing one of the walls in this area. Details like candles added some visual interest and narrative to the map while helping to sell the new changes. Removing all vents was a top priority for us, because they hindered free and easy movement along Crown s various paths: Here, much like on de_cache, players only need to jump one time in order to swiftly reach higher elevation at Middle. We also added a well to CT Courtyard, giving players some minimal cover, helping the map s scale, and livening up the area. Crown Continues All in all, major surgery on Crown is now complete, but your feedback is still invaluable. If it weren t for the community, Crown might not have matured so much post-release. You made your voices heard, and Volcano and I were listening. Check out the next page for a photographic tour of Crown's full evolution, from the blocky gray-box it once was, to the shippable, polished map it is now. We hope you continue to let us know how we re doing. Most importantly, we hope you enjoy the newly updated Crown when its big update goes live on the workshop very soon! ",

Grimes presentation mainly focused on how Valve developed its method for mostly-automating the creation of new weapon skins that roll out regularly in updates like Operation Phoenix and Winter Offensive. Late into the talk, though, Grimes brought up data from Steam Graph as a way of measuring the impact of CS:GO s content updates on its it s popularity, which is high enough lately to make it the second most-played game on Steam. I ve duplicated Grimes graph here with some additional annotations of my own. Click for a larger version. As the graph indicates, free CS:GO weekends doubled the game s peak concurrent users in November 2012 and May 2013. The launch of an item economy through the Arms Race update in August 2013 had a significant . As Grimes put it during her talk: After our economy launched, we had a pretty dramatic increase in peak player numbers, bringing us to regular highs that we d only achieved previously by making the game temporarily free. Tournaments, though, have produced the most substantial upticks in concurrent users, presumably due to the fact that CS:GO allows players to watch competitive matches in the game client in real-time. This last spike here is Dreamhack. It s a big tournament for CS:GO with a high viewership, said Grimes at GDC. Our game was also on sale during this time period and that caused a huge player spike, nearly doubling our player count. There was a large influx of new players at this time, and they stuck around at a really high rate. In fact they stuck around at a much higher rate than players from previous sales. And so we can see that not only are our player numbers up, but our player retention is up. The recent EMS One Katowice tourney seemed to skyrocket CS:GO s peak concurrent users by 50 or 60,000. Without access to numbers for Battlefield 4 and other games, we re left to assume that CS:GO s 2.2 million monthly unique players are enough to make it the most popular multiplayer shooter on PC.",

Their goal with Crown is simple: build the best competitive Counter-Strike map ever. In part two, Snelling breaks down Crown s level design and the tools used to build map geometry and textures. The first step in making a multiplayer map is creating a layout. But what is a layout? For level designers, a layout is the floor-plan of a level lurking in their brain, which they often draw out as a blueprint and then sculpt into a 3D grey box representation in-game. For everyday players, a layout is how they visualize a level s available paths and make strategic decisions. We spent nine months refining Crown s layout into the final map it is today. And now Crown is ready for the public. It s available today. You can download the map right now &nbsp;on the Steam Workshop and play it in Counter-Strike: GO. Read on to learn how we built it. A top-down view of Crown's layout. The sheer number of revisions Crown has gone through over the course of nine months reveals the enormous challenge of mapping an environment from your imagination. Grey boxing is very much like sprouting a new world out of thin air like a creative big bang and for that reason it is a frustrating, difficult stage of a map s development that many people never get past. Volcano and I spent countless hours pondering layout details both in our grey-boxed version of Crown, and once the map evolved into a more visually detailed environment. I think almost every level designer in the world recognizes that no matter how well thought-out, a level will always go through a maturation process once it becomes a playable space. Thankfully, Crown s earliest stages are well documented, allowing us to show screenshots of Crown in its infancy. Above: an early image of Crown as a grey box. Below: finalized version of the same part of the map. Can you spot the subtle changes in geometry? The right path Our primary goals with Crown s grey boxed layout was to maintain the spacious, open feeling of Dust2, without losing sight of the precise efficiency of Inferno s layout. It's also about the size of Dust2, making it a fairly small map. For this reason, Volcano and I decided to make the map s geometry imposing and impressive. To focus on one area which evolved during our discussions, this path outside of CT spawn, for example, would become the focus of continued revision throughout Crown s development. Another grey box shot of Crown featuring a fountain \"prop.\" The fountain is removed as final geometry begins to shape up. To further highlight Crown s evolution, the window pictured in this (near) final image has since been removed. Volcano s goal with this epic walkway was to include elements of verticality similar to a map like Nuke verticality which extends all the way into the B bombsite without creating awkward firefights where players are forced to look straight up at the sky. The path leading up to this vertical terrace was a challenge: although we wanted verticality, one consequence of creating higher ground is that it can make surrounding areas obsolete. Our perch needed to have drawbacks and limitations which would make the lower path viable. Over time, we added a slot above the terrorist entrance leading into this route which would allow an attacking team to coordinate smoke and flash grenades to block visibility along this long sight-line. Much later in the development process, we added a route into the area commonly referred to as armory. We observed players having difficulty retaking the bombsite due to limited entry points and the additional route alleviated the issue and made the armory a crucial area to control in the bombsite. The editor &nbsp; The view from the Valve Hammer Editor Counter-Strike: GO maps are made with Hammer, an aging tool which isn t easy to use. In Hammer, geometry is mostly composed of brushes, a fancy word for cubes, and mapping resembles playing with LEGO. Walls or other flat surfaces can be brushwork. Other intricate elements you might see in a level such as a chair, a light fixture or an ornamental doorway, are props models imported from programs like Maya or 3DSMAX. Here you can see editor screenshots of Crown s brushwork, as well as flat screenshots which place emphasis on Crown s total geometry (brushwork + props). Clockwise: Wireframe view, flat-lighting view, differentiating between props and brushwork, final lighting Source unfortunately hits a brush limit fast. It would be difficult to make 1/4th of Crown with brushes alone; we needed to convert much of the brushwork of the map into models in order for the map to compile. Compiling is a process which converts the map into a file readable by the Source engine. In practice, compiling means sitting around at your computer for an hour and a half while lighting is baked. Every time you make a change in your level and want to see those changes in-game, a new compile is required. Behind every map ever made for Counter-Strike, Half-Life, or Day of Defeat, was a level designer staring blankly at this screen. A level designer most likely staring, snoring, or eating. Textures: the lifeblood of a map Textures really are the lifeblood of a map. Simple geometry is nice, but a texture controls so much about the color of a map, the feel of surfaces, and the way our eyes process an environment. Here you can see an excellent example of a common texture used throughout Crown, made by the artist PenE (from Crytek Germany), which I made some minor alterations to for the sake of color. While I did make a few textures, most of Crown s textures are made as a favor by my friends. When texture re-use or borrowing isn t an option, I tend to ask myself what do I actually need to match what I see in a photographic reference? In the case of this eagle plaque, I grabbed an open-source image of the Spanish army flag. I liked this image of an eagle because it conveyed the strong, resonant power Volcano and I wanted to echo throughout Crown. I then overlayed that eagle onto a marble texture used frequently throughout the map, on loan from the brilliant artist Kikette from Arkane (the developers who made Dishonored). From that point on, I focused on building a convincing diffuse map by painting on staining, highlighting, and other details. Although making custom assets is time consuming and difficult, I try not to make sacrifices in my own vision of an area, simply because GO s default assets don t resemble what I need. The Crown eagle plaque, based on a Spanish army emblem The fun part Contending with Hammer is tough, but seeing your work come alive is a thrill. And thanks to GO s updated lighting engine, level geometry is lit so beautifully and naturalistically. Here you can observe the way geometry, lighting, and texturing come together over time compared with our real-world reference. Photo via Expedia.com Above: Pathway to Crown's bombsite B and a reference photo from Barcelona. Below: Crown's Terrorist spawn and a Barcelona reference photo. Photo via Tabitha and Dave's European Adventures blog Gameplay, gameplay, gameplay In summation, Crown went through several distinct creative processes. First, imaginary geometry was transferred from Volcano s brain, to paper, to the editor. Secondly, we refined our basic grey box map into something which reflected not just our initial visions of Crown, but also a practical map because you always notice things about a grey box you hadn t considered before actually making it. Thirdly, we tested this grey box. Fourthly, we tried to meld our grey box into a plausible approximation of Barcelona, Spain by using default assets or by creating what was needed. Finally, we tested and refined some more. Then we had a map. Then we had Crown the real, playable level. You can download it on the Steam Workshop and play it now, and you can read about the inspiration for Crown's design in part one of Building Crown. In the final article of this series, we will explore professional play testing, and the iterative process that happens when Volcano and I walk around our map. We will examine our approach to playtests, the expectations we have, and how we talk through changes to the map. Our goal is to give you insight into each step of the creative process of making a Counter-Strike map.",

After watching some of the highlights from this weekend s 2014 EMS One Katowice Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Championship, I was reminded how tense and thrilling Counter-Strike can get. Here are some of the best moments from the event in Poland, from some of the best players in the world. My favorite video by far is of Janusz sNax Pogorzleski from Virtus.Pro (the team that also won the championship) silently taking down three NiP members. The restraint he demonstrates here, waiting for the perfect moment, is unbelievable: From markeloff vs. Titan, a completely different, chaotic moment. Cornered and almost out of ammo, markeloff pulls through: Four shots with the AWP, four kills. Brutal: More incredible AWP skills: And finally, here s Virtus.Pro winning the championship. Listen to that crowd! In addition to a giant trophy, Virtus.Pro also won $100,000 of the $250,000 community-funded prize pool.",

Their goal with Crown is simple: build the best competitive Counter-Strike map ever. In part one, Snelling dives into the inspiration for Crown's design and the essence of a great competitive map. This is Crown: a new map for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive nine months in the making. After over 100 substantial revisions across those nine months, Crown is nearly finished. It was designed with two goals: to make CS:GO s hardcore fans happy while disrupting GO s stagnant competitive map pool. It s inspired by classic maps like Dust2 and Inferno. But it s built to be even better. Just as CS:GO is a new evolution for the Counter-Strike franchise, Crown is a map which seeks to learn from the best and build upon the principles that have kept Dust2 and Inferno in competitive play for more than a decade. Before Crown: rebuilding Cache At heart, a map is an idea. Great maps conjure singular, iconic images in our minds. Dust2: the sandy desert village. Inferno: a labyrinth of grainy alleyways. Nuke: a towering facility. These places do not exist except in-game and in our collective consciousness. Real-world inspiration for de_inferno One map, Cache, only recently entered that collective consciousness. Cache was originally designed by Sal Volcano Garozzo for Counter-Strike: Source in Spring 2010. When CS:GO was released, Cache was ported to the Steam Workshop, where it became a staple of professional competitive leagues. After I created two GO maps of my own, I took a look at Cache and was impressed with what I saw. Maps like Cache have a unity to them a clean, simple flow. I wasn t surprised to learn that Volcano was originally a professional CS player, and a legend in the scene. What was surprising was that Cache was the very first map he ever made. This was someone I had to work with. Before we tackled building a new map, we set about modernizing Cache. Cache has since been featured in two of CS:GO s Operation map-promotions, included in many of the game's most prestigious tournaments, and is played by thousands of players for more than 11,000 hours every day. Even before our work on Cache was complete, though, Volcano and I were imagining that new, original project we had put on hold the map which would become Crown. Dreaming up Crown: level design fundamentals When Volcano and I were brainstorming a new map, we broke down what we liked and didn t like about the existing map pool. I have a confession to make: other than Cache, it's rare to see me playing any map other than Dust2. Just talking about Dust2 transforms into Captain Ahab from Moby Dick: the old sailor who got his leg bitten off by that white whale and forever-afterwards harbored a maniacal, obsessive grudge against it. I want to make a map better than Dust2 almost more than I want to breathe. And then I talked to Volcano, and he actually prefers Inferno! A timeless view of de_dust2's spaciousness Volcano and I have slightly different perspectives. I dig Dust2 because it s easy to play, is spacious, and has a warm-feeling aesthetic. Volcano likes Inferno because its layout is probably the best in the game for competitive play: teams have a large number of different strategic choices, and they never feel predictable. To boil it down, I was thinking sort of abstractly about visceral things how the map would feel to play while Volcano s emphasis was first and foremost on making a layout for competitive play. We both recognized, however, that a great map must have both of those elements. de_inferno's pristine layout Cache also influenced Crown substantially, but not how you might expect. Because Cache places so much emphasis on its middle area, Volcano told me that he wanted to create a map that went in the opposite direction completely: a map without a traditional middle. This made me nervous. When Terrorists plant the bomb in one of two bombsites, any Counter-Terrorists on the other side of the map have to either rotate to that bombsite or flank around and kill any Terrorists in the area, while the bomb is still ticking, before they can try to defuse it. A map without a middle means there is no central path allowing the CTs to get to the ticking bomb more quickly. Cache's infamously dangerous middle Rotating on Crown is a special, stressful challenge. Entire Terrorist teams will have to either barge into one bombsite, or split up to create confusing diversions in both. Counter-Terrorists will need to predict the Terrorists' intent, or rotating will be down-to-the-wire or futile. No other map used in competitive play will place as much emphasis on rotation, and I think the consequence of this will be game-defining sieges or Alamo-style defenses. It s going to be do-or-die from start to finish, and individual players will need to come up big for their team. Or their team will lose. For these reasons, we are confident Crown will place equal emphasis on skill and strategic play. Eye on the Crown: back to the visceral Many Counter-Strike purists are skeptical of maps with good graphics. I can't blame them. Nice-looking maps are often poorly optimized, which is an absolute game-breaker for competitive play. Nice looking maps are also often superficially designed they rarely take into account all of the layout features that make a league map actually work. Even if a nice looking map runs well and has a nice layout, it generally makes sacrifices in readability (the ease of seeing other players in a sea of detail). Valve designed its TF2 characters around the readability of their silhouettes Great graphics are not negotiable, though, especially if mappers are trying to get their map promoted in a Valve Operation. But because Volcano and I are so focused on league play in addition to promotion in an Operation, Crown is designed to maintain a high frame rate and be readable. Crown sets out to please competitive players by choosing a setting which naturally defuses their concerns about readability. Barcelona, Spain has beautiful, classical architecture with smooth, clean surfaces. This provides a perfect back-drop for the easy identification of enemies. Much like the orange walls of Dust, the smooth, beige surfaces of Crown create a warm, welcoming and satisfying space for players. Above: Classical architecture in Barcelona, Spain. Below: Crown. This visceral pleasantness is one of the less-obvious aspects of aesthetics I learned from Volcano when working on Cache. During that project, Volcano talked a lot about how surrounding players in a lively, upbeat environment would associate our map with positive emotions over time. Our discussions about mood ultimately made Cache a less grim environment. While Cache still takes place in a somewhat grungy Soviet facility, areas of vegetation and overgrowth make it more satisfying to play. Breaking ground: ready to build With a setting established and our perspectives joined in a coherent philosophy, Volcano and I set to work on Crown with a distinct purpose. This new map had to echo with ambition. It had to be presumptuous not to politely ask to be considered alongside Dust2 or Inferno, but to boldly shoulder into them like an NFL linebacker, recover the fumble, score the touchdown and then spike the football. It had to be loud and self-evidently great hence the name Crown. But that's just talk for now. Empty words until you play the map for yourself. This was our vision. In the coming weeks, we'll show you exactly how a map like Crown is made. We'll dig into the nitty-gritty details in the next article, discussing 3D map tools, texture work, and the mechanics of level design. In part three, we'll dive into the feedback and iteration process that takes place over nine months of daily hard work. We'll also present a video tour of the finished map. And then you'll be able to play it for yourself: Crown will be released on March 18th, two days after the conclusion of CS:GO s $250,000 EMS One Katowice tournament.",

For Operation Phoenix, the maps were chosen by popular vote - and as such, round up some of the best battlegrounds featured in previous operations. Although, if you're anything like me, the quality is less important than the variety. When you're inevitably killed in the first few seconds of the round, it's important to have some nice level design to enjoy through the death camera. The returning eight maps are Cache, Motel, Seaside, Downtown, Thunder, Ali, Favela and Agency. All will be available to play in Casual, Competitive and Deathmatch modes, ensuring a busy few months of battle in the constant war between terrorism and not terrorism. Purchase of the $3 access pack also provides buyers with a Coin, which can be upgraded through playtime and wins. The Phoenix Coin is also a scorecard - giving players a complete run down of their stats across the included maps. Throughout the event, chests containing a selection of new weapon finishes will also drop. Head over to the CS:GO blog for a statistical rundown of each map. Operation Phoenix will run until June 4th.",

Up until now they've been mainly concerned with Call of Duty, but they've recently announced their roster for 2014, which includes tourneys for DOTA 2, Counter-Strike GO and StarCraft 2 across February and March. There are cash prizes on offer for teams that wish to enter, and you don't have to pay anything for the privilege - but signups do close Monday at 17:00 GMT, so if you're interested in participating you'll need to get a wriggle on. The rest of us will be able to watch the events on their Twitch channel. Details below. As noted below, you'll need to form at least a five-person team to be able to enter any of these, or at the very least be able to split yourself into a minimum of five clones, a little like the dude out of Misfits. There are a number of competitions, starting the 24th of Feb and running through to the end of March. DOTA 2 Pro League $7500 prize pot between x6 teams Open tournaments (newcomers) X5 weekly cups have been arranged starting from 24th February Each tournament consists of a $500 prize pot CS: GO Pro League Features x6 of the top EU teams from the Alienware Pro League who will compete for a $7,500 prize pot Open Tournaments (newcomers) Registered teams will be ranked into divisions (ensuring teams of equal ability are competing together) and will play on a fixed night each week for x5 weeks for the chance to win a share in a $2,500 prize pot StarCraft II Elite Division Top x6 players will complete for a share of the $3000 prize pot Open 1:1 Leagues (newcomers) Registered players will compete for the chance to win a share of the $2,500 prize pot Once again, the deadline for entry closes tomorrow at 5PM. If you're interested, the Gfinity site is the place to sign up for the various events.",

The new documentary follows professional Counter-Strike: GO player Jonatan \"Devilwalk\" Lundberg and his Fnatic team as it attempts to win the Dreamhack Winter 2013 tournament. A support player in the Fnatic Counter-Strike squad, Lundberg likens himself to a psychologist or \"shrink,\" as he puts it, in that a big part of achieving any goal is keeping people together and focused on a single objective. \"We are a team that doesn't really change,\" Lundberg says in the film. \"We've had the same core players since the start of the year and that's really, really unique. People quit, people change lineups because they get in fights, can't resolve their issues. So they just start over, which is the wrong way to go I think.\" As well as offering polished insight into some of the personalities behind a top eSports team, director Zacharias Dyrborg's film features some great play-by-play action of competitive Counter-Strike and works to explain the mindset of the Fnatic team before and after each match. For me, it showed that while skill will almost always show itself in highly stressful situations, success can also depend just as much on understanding how to take advantage of the emotional side of competition.",

And a CoD-Like. Whatever Steam users think about the game, the community now has access to a new weapon type. Alongisde highly important features like \"added diagnostic info to debug video config reset\", the most recent patch has introduced the CZ75-Auto, a fully automatic pistol. \"When you load CS:GO today, you ll get a new stock weapon in your inventory,\" write Valve. \"The fully-automatic CZ75-Auto is available for both teams, and can be equipped as a loadout alternative to the P250. \"An inexpensive option against armored opponents, the CZ s stats are identical to the P250 with two important exceptions: the pistol is fully-automatic, and comes with far less ammo. Accurate and deadly, the CZ75-Auto demands precise timing and trigger discipline.\" That pistol can also be skinned in a variety of ways through the finishes contained in the new CSGO Weapons Case 3. That case is now dropping in-game because, as the tags themselves say, \"Marketable Items\".",

Naturally, Valve are readying for the game's third major Operation, and have been holding a vote to determine which community maps would get the official server treatment. While, according to Valve, those votes are still being counted (what, are they doing it by hand?), some maps have proved popular enough to have already secured a place. In a post on the CS:GO blog, Cache is announced as the operation's first confirmed battleground. Cache is a bomb defusal map, set in Chernobyl of all places. Unlike other video game representations of the city, this one isn't inhabited by mutants, but instead by terrorists who are attempting to destroy a weapons cache. It's already available through the Steam Workshop, albeit not on the pristine pings of an official Valve server. If there was any doubt about the popularity of the map, an infographic accompanying the post reveals that 11,753 hours are played in Cache every day. That and other incidental facts can be found over at the CS:GO blog.",

Each capsule contains one sticker out of a series of sticker designs. The Sticker Capsules are dropped at the end of matches, and are opened with a Sticker Capsule key. The stickers can be applied to any gun in the game. You can also apply multiple stickers to a single weapon. They're a little like Team Fortress 2 hats, only for your guns. Gun hats! In addition to the new stickers and some under-the-hood performance improvements, CS:GO's devs have tweaked the UI and weapon balancing. The UI highlights: Added player teammate colors in Competitive Mode that displays a unique color per teammate in the radar, playercount panel, scoreboard and the arrow over their head (can be toggled offline with cl_cmm_showteamplayercolors). Enemies icons on radar are now a different shape than teammates. Added sort method 'Equipped' to the Inventory. The biggest addition is the ability to use alternate fire to throw grenades underhand a short distance. Throw strength can be finely controlled by combining secondary and alternate fire. In weapon balance news, the AUG and SG553 have received improved rates of fire and scoped control. Across the board, automatic weapons have seen a 50 percent increase in movement inaccuracy, but movement inaccuracy when walking is now being calculated differently for all guns, improving overall movement accuracy. In terms of new content, the latest update also rolled out the Overpass and Cobblestone maps to all players. While stickers are an interesting addition, cosmetic upgrades, a marketplace and Team Fortress 2-style random drops are not new to CS:GO. Last year, Valve introduced weapon skins to the game in the Arms Deal update, which function similarly to stickers. Check out the full patch notes for minor fixes and tweaks to several of CS:GO's maps.",

This visual guide will teach you how to set up your game for the maximum competitive advantage. There s no singular best practice, as a lot of configuration is personal preference, but there are tweaks you can make to graphics and network settings, keybindings, and more to help outplay the competition. Understand your graphics settings There s no consensus among the competitive community about which screen resolution is the best. Lots of players look towards the pros using ancient 4:3 resolutions such as 800x600 for guidance. However, there is no singular advantage provided by using 4:3 resolutions. Some hardcore players use these resolutions because they were optimal in the 1.6 era and allowed legacy CRTs to hit higher refresh rates, and pros are generally change-averse. But when you re using a 4:3 resolution, your horizontal field of view is just 74 degrees. Some players prefer this narrow view as it allows them to focus centrally on their target, and positions the radar closer to center. At 16:9 the player has a 90-degree field of view, which allows more vision towards the edges of the screen. I value this peripheral vision over narrow focus, and thus use 1920x1080 (16:9). Ideally, you want to use the native resolution of your monitor while maximizing your framerate. The single best way to increase your FPS is to drop your resolution, so let's dig into CS:GO's graphics settings. Improve FPS with launch options Make all your graphical adjustments with the knowledge that CS:GO is a CPU-limited game in general. There s no holy grail console or config command that can dramatically improve your FPS, but there are some slight tweaks we can make. Drop all your in game graphics settings to low, disable anti-aliasing, enable multi-core rendering Add these launch options to your launch parameters in Steam (see screenshot above): -novid -console -high -threads 4 These commands disable the intro, enable the console, set the process affinity to high, and grant your cores to CS:GO, even though technically Source can only use 3 threads. Some players add the -processheap parameter thinking it will grant better fps, but because this substitutes Windows memory management for Valve s own code it is highly recommend to remove it. The next step involves modifying CS:GO's config file. It's a bit more complicated, but allows us to make some really useful tweaks. Adjust graphics settings in the config file Find your config.cfg in the cfg folder within the game directory (default C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo\\cfg). If you don't already have file extensions enabled in Windows, you should enable them now to make sure that, when you edit the config file, it retains the .cfg extension. To turn on file extensions, click Organize in Windows Explorer, click Folder and search options, tab over to View, and uncheck Hide extensions for known file types. Now let's edit config.cfg. You can open it in Windows Notepad, but it'll be easier to read with a more advanced text editor, like the free Notepad++. Now, edit these lines in the config file. For most of them, you'll simply be switching out a 0 for a 1, or something similar. r_drawtracers_firstperson Set to \"0\" - Disable first-person tracers. Enemy tracers are still drawn. mat_monitorgamma Set to \"2.1\" - The brighter the better so you can illuminate enemies. mat_queue_mode \"-1\" - Auto-detect multi-core rendering mat_savechanges Add this line to write video settings to the registry. cl_forcepreload 1 - Forces the game to load all the sound and art assets on map load. This can help you if you experience stuttering when certain sounds go off, such as throwing a grenade into a bunch of props cl_disablehtmlmotd 1 - disables those annoying ads when connecting to a server cl_autowepswitch 0 - Disables automatically switching to a primary gun you pick up off the ground so you don t draw an unloaded weapon cl_disablefreezecam 1 - Disables the annoying freeze on death so you can make proper calls to your team mates You can save your changes, but don't close the config file just yet. Next, we're going to tweak the most vital of all CS:GO settings: network settings. Adjust network settings in the config file These network settings are the most important commands you will type into your config file. Find the following commands in your config and change their values as noted: cl_interp \"0\" cl_cmdrate \"128\" cl_updaterate \"128\" Also, add rate to your config file with the following value: rate \"128000\" Think of it like this: there are two versions of Counter-Strike being played, yours and the server s. The client version is (default) 100 milliseconds in the past of the \"real\" (server) version of the game world. The more updates you have, the less interpolation (prediction) is required by your PC to accurately figure out what the server world looks like. If the server and your client compare data, and the server overrides your hit, then what you think is a hit will be a miss. There may be times when you ll shoot someone and see blood, for example, but then the client reports 0 damage. This occurs because blood decals are client-side. Your client believes you scored a hit, draws the blood, and sends the packets to the server to be checked. If the server rules a miss, then the player takes 0 damage. This is why you want your client s perception of the world to be as close to the server s perception as possible. Decreasing interpolation runs the moderate risk of experiencing laggy players models jittering. It is beneficial to lose smoothness to gain accuracy. The goal for competitive play is to always have the lowest possible amount of client side interpolation and gain the most accurate representation of the game world. So we set our cl_interp value to 0. By setting it to 0 the game will automatically set the interp to the lowest possible value allowed by the server. Next we want as many updates per second as the server will possibly give us. A 66 tic Valve matchmaking server defaults rates to 66. In case you ever play on a higher tic rate server we want to set our cl_updaterate to 128 and our cl_cmdrate to 128. You can use higher values, but it won t matter. With these settings, any time you connect to a higher value server, it will default you to the highest values allowed. The same goes with rate, which is the size of the packets. You want as much information as possible so we set this to 128000. Again, this will default to the highest amount a server will allow. You can never have too much of a good thing! \"Now,\" you might ask, \"my monitor's refresh rate is 60hz and thus those extra frames are not drawn, do I still benefit?\" The answer is yes. There are other variables to consider, such as input lag, mouse polling, and a general overall smoothness. If you have a high framerate, your input lag will be infinitely lower, and your mouse will feel smoother, even if your monitor is not actually drawing those frames. The physics, the tics, all the send/receive commands are still triggering themselves at a more rapid pace, and thus your representation of the game world is better, even if the frames are not technically being projected into your eyeballs. Set up hotkeys for buys and grenades Using a simple syntax in the config.cfg file, you can set up hotkeys to buy specific loadouts. The brackets below are to demonstrate where you'd place a word or letter, so don't actually type the brackets into the config file. bind buy So, if you wanted to bind the up arrow to buy an AK or M4 (depending on team), the command would be: bind KP_UPARROW buy ak47;buy m4a1 Or if you wanted the home key to buy armor or head armor (based on cash) the command would be: bind KP_HOME buy vest;buy vesthelm It is extremely useful to bind separate keys for different grenade types. This way, you can throw a counter-flash while completely blind, instead of fumbling through the grenade menu. It works the same way, but the command is use\" instead of \"buy.\" For example, let s say I want to bind f to put a flashbang in my hand. The command is: bind f use weapon_flashbang Or maybe I want to use v to pull out a smoke grenade. bind v use weapon_smokegrenade Here's a list of weapon codes in CS:GO. Rifles ak47 : AK-47 aug : Aug famas : Famas galilar : Galil m4a1 : M4 sg556 : Sig aka Krieg Sniper Rifles awp : AWP g3sg1 : Terrorist Autosniper scar20 : CT Autosniper ssg08 : Scout Shotguns mag7 : Mag7 CT Pump shotgun nova : Nova Pump Shotgun xm1014 : Auto Shotty sawedoff : T Pump Shotgun Pistols p250 : P250 elite : Dual Berettas fiveseven : Five-SeveN deagle : Desert Eagle tec9 : Tec9 SMGs bizon : PP-19 Bizon mac10 : Mac 10 mp7 : MP7 mp9 : CT MP9 (TMP replacement) p90 : P90 ump45 : UMP Machine Guns m249 : Machinegun negev : Negev Machine Gun Utility decoy : Decoy Grenade flashbang : Flash Grenade hegrenade : HE Grenade incgrenade : CT Incendiary Grenade molotov : T Incendiary Grenade smokegrenade : Smoke Grenade Customize the HUD There s a few tweaks to your HUD you can experiment with in the config file. hud_scaling (0.5-0.95) - Allows you to change the size of the HUD cl_radar_always_centered 0 - A lot of players prefer the default 1 but as in-game lead I like being able to see the entire map on the radar cl_radar_scale \".4\" - changes the radar zoom size so you can see more Customize your crosshair There is no best crosshair, but I prefer small classic static. A static crosshair does not expand during movement. As the crosshair s expansion does not accurately reflect current accuracy values I recommend using a static crosshair. Update: After talking to Matt Wood from Valve, who wrote \"the same data that's used to determine the accuracy of your bullets is used to draw the spread of the crosshair (on the same frame),\" Matt is definitely right and what I wrote about the dynamic crosshair wasn't correct. A dynamic crosshair in CS:Go does correctly show the accuracy values in real time, unlike in previous iterations of the game. I think most competitive players just do not use it because they are used to their legacy crosshairs, and the constant movement can be distracting. New players may benefit from the dynamic crosshair's visual feedback displaying how controlled movement improves their accuracy. Again in the config file, change these values to customize your crosshair. cl_crosshairdot \"0\" - This command disables the center dot cl_crosshair_drawoutline \"1\" - I recommend everyone turn this outline on so the crosshair is more visible cl_crosshair_outlinethickness \"2\" - Set to 1, 2, or 3 to adjust thickness. I prefer 2. Crosshair style and color can easily be adjusted in CS:GO's Game Settings menu. Choose the right mouse sensitivity Want greater control and accuracy in combat? To find the right mouse sensitivity, lower your sensitivity to a level that feels uncomfortable to play at, and then raise it one notch. The lower your sensitivity the more control you as a player have over your accuracy. While you need to find a sensitivity that works for you, I generally suggest a complete mouse swipe should be around 120 degrees of in-game movement. Remember, in CS, if someone is behind you, you re probably already dead anyway. You want to completely eliminate mouse acceleration. Mouse acceleration increases the distance traveled based on speed of the movement. This is not ideal for consistency. You want a 1:1 ratio between mouse movement and in-game view rotation. In the Windows Control Panel, make sure your mouse sensitivity is set to the sixth notch. Disable enhanced pointer precision to remove windows modifiers and disable acceleration. Disable all mouse acceleration in your mouse drivers, if you use special software from Razer, Steelseries, etc. If you use a gaming mouse and software which allows custom DPI settings, use the native DPI of your mouse so there is no interpolation. If your software allows, use a 500 Hz or 1000 Hz refresh rate on the mouse. 125 Hz = 8 ms; 500 Hz = 2 ms; 1000 Hz = 1 ms. Selecting a mouse There are six variables to consider when purchasing a competitive mouse: DPI, hardware acceleration, prediction, max perfect control speed, malfunction speed, and lift off distance. DPI stands for dots per inch. The higher the DPI, the faster the mouse will move per inch. A lot of gaming mice are sold at stupidly high DPIs. Be aware these products are not always ideal. The other variables are much more important than a high DPI. Hardware acceleration is built in mouse acceleration. You want to avoid this at all costs. A lot of laser mice suffer hardware acceleration, as well as some older mice like the MX518. Prediction, also known as angle snapping, causes the mouse to try to smooth out your input and create a straight line. Max perfect control speed and malfunction speed are related. The max perfect control speed is the speed at which the mouse begins to lose perfect tracking, and the malfunction speed is when tracking ceases to work. Have you ever flicked your mouse for a shot and your control spasmed? Your mouse s control speeds are too low and it is time to upgrade! Lift off distance is the lift height required to stop tracking. If you do not want to do all the research I highly recommend a Logitech G400 at 800 DPI. Selecting a mousepad There s a million options available to gamers when it comes to mouse surfaces. There are two general types: resistance pads and slick pads. A cloth pad would be an example of a resistance pad. The friction of the cloth against the mouse skates requires more effort for the same movement, thus offering more granular control. Slick pads decrease friction and allow for quick snapshots. I recommend a cloth pad for new players starting out. If you have to use a laser mouse avoid black pads, as they can cause some tracking problems. I use an 11 year old DKT fat cloth pad. Get_Right, arguably the best player in the world, uses a Zowie speed pad and Zowie EC1 Evo. The Steel Series QCK mouse pads are also incredible. It really comes down to personal preference.",

Now a grizzled veteran, it was all set for retirement. Unfortunately, the horror of war will stop for no man community event, and it's been called back for one last tour of duty. By which I mean it's been extended to February 5th. Why extend past the original planned end date of January 20th? Probably because the event has proved exceptionally popular. According to the CS:GO blog, players have already spent 2.8 million hours fighting through Bravo's maps. Expect Valve to release more stats when Bravo does finally end in two weeks' time. Bravo - like Payback before it - gives players access to official dedicated server support on eight community-made maps in Deathmatch, Casual and Competitive Modes. Buyers also receive a coin, upgradable through playtime and wins on Bravo maps, and a scorecard that tracks more detailed stats across their Bravo career.

The three-pronged campaign to put Steam in your living room, deliberately revealed ahead of the launch of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, was the biggest PC gaming news of the year. It s a move that establishes Valve as something that resembles a platform holder, something it s been hesitant to do despite being the PC s biggest online retailer. We re glad that Valve is removing some of the obstacles to playing Civilization V on our couch. It gets us imagining PC gaming as a more social experience for friends, family members, and whatever other human beings you let into your house. That picture will come into focus at CES next week, when we expect a second wave of information from Valve on its initiative. We ll also hopefully leave Vegas with a better understanding of how versatile the Steam Controller is, which we ve been investigating. But even if Valve s controller exceeds our expectations and plays a very wide set of games comfortably, there s an serious need for a keyboard and mouse platform that can be used effortlessly on a couch. I m challenging accessory makers like Razer and Logitech to make one. Control issues Just 290 of Steam s 2,459 games feature full controller support, and 502 feature partial support a cumulative third of the library. Even if we give generous consideration to Valve s claim that the Steam Controller older games into thinking they re being played with a keyboard and mouse, I m still going to need to edit command lines, to chat with my Steam friends, to Alt + Tab, and no amount of virtual keyboards, haptic feedback, and autocomplete will ameliorate that. In particular, I don t have high hopes for how well hotbar-heavy games like Dota 2, Starbound, Path of Exile, RTSes and MMORPGs will handle on the Steam Controller. The Phantom Lapboard. \"Do you like typing on a keyboard that s locked at a significant angle to the natural plane of your hands? Of course you don t,\" Maximum PC wrote in 2010. The peripheral, though, isn t actually the problem it s the absence of a stable surface in the living room that rests above your legs. Our friends at Tested put it this way in an article from last July: If you just put your mouse and keyboard on the coffee table and perch on the edge of your couch, you're gonna hurt your neck and back, craning your neck to see the TV. Conventional mice and keyboards can work in the living room, but not without a desklike platform to rest them on. Infinium Labs yes, that Infinium Labs now known as Phantom Entertainment, produced one of the only commercial solutions to this problem, the Phantom Lapboard: a $110, wireless, cantered keyboard and mouse combo. It s bad. The bottom line is that this thing is bad, our sister site Maximum PC said in its 2010 review. The keyboard only tilts at a single angle, the mouse only features two buttons and a scroll wheel, and there s no lip on the surface to contain it. The second you take your hand off the mouse to type something, that sucker s clattering to the floor, MaxPC wrote. The Couchmaster is the weirder and even more expensive alternative, a hulking, 24 -wide, upholstered thigh prison that at least provides a stable, ergonomic surface. But it s a frown-inducing $180, and its cumbersome shape doesn t seem conducive to easy storage or use in any living room that doesn t feature a wide couch. Apart from Ikeaing something wooden and rigid together, the two options PC gamers have are pricey and strange. If anything, they show us two designs that any future lapboards should avoid, or at least iterate on aggressively. With Valve s initiative, third-party manufacturers should be scrambling to produce a lapboard that accommodates gaming mice and keyboards, if only because it s an item that will help them sell more mice and keyboards. Razer has a small history of experiments like the Artemis prototype and the Razer Hydra, but more practically, they already make left-handed keypads like the Orbweaver and Nostromo, devices that would be the perfect starting points for a compact lapboard. Logitech would be another good candidate; they make plenty of mainstream wireless peripherals, and on the gaming side they have an ambidextrous keypad we like, the G13. Valve should want such a peripheral to be available as an alternative to its controller. After all, a sturdy, inexpensive, versatile gaming lapboard would absolutely increase the adoption of living room PCs and SteamOS. Valve s goal isn t to sell controllers, it s to get you playing PC games on your couch, and we should all want that proposition to be as effortless as possible. An innovative controller can t and won t replace the decades-long relationship PC gamers have with WASD because PC gamers don t like compromise we expect high framerate, high resolution, low cost, and total freedom to modify our devices and games. And while we re grateful for a controller that s built with PC gamers and PC games in mind, it s essential that we get a compromise-free way of bringing the core implements of our hobby, the mouse and keyboard, into the living room.",

It pairs with Valve's free SteamOS and whatever living room PC it's installed on as a solution to the clumsiness of using a mouse and keyboard on the couch. In a new video demonstration, Valve does its best to convince us that Steam Controller really offers a level of control comparable to our traditional instruments of gaming. First we see Portal 2, which demonstrates that—unlike analog sticks—the trackpads can be configured for 1-to-1 control. \"Directly move your thumb a fixed amount of distance on the pad, and the view will correspond to the fixed amount of distance,\" says Hardware Engineer Jeff Bellinghausen. Meanwhile, he says, the left trackpad has been configured as a D-pad to simulate WASD. Later in the video, Bellinghausen plays Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with great accuracy, though his aiming looks a bit slower than it might have been with a mouse—obviously, we'd need to see a comparison video of him playing with a mouse to know for sure. Civilization V and Papers, Please also demonstrate how accurate the trackpad is for mouse-based games. It looks like it works—not just like a mouse, but like something more accurate and responsive than analog sticks. Trying to move a mouse pointer around with velocity-based control is miserable, and this doesn't look miserable. Seeing isn't believing—we need to feel this thing in our hands to judge it—but it does build confidence, and Valve will be posting updates like this \"frequently.\"",

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/09/27/steam-controller-announced-by-valve/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Steam Controller announced by Valve\"> </a> Rounding out its set of living room-centric announcements this week, Steam Controller has been revealed by Valve, a 16-button, haptic-driven gamepad that Valve says is hackable, includes a touch screen, will feature sharable configurations, and has the ambitious goal of “supporting all games in the Steam catalog.” No price was announced for the controller, and it doesn't appear to feature motion control. In place of analog sticks, Steam Controller features two circular, clickable trackpads. Valve claims that PC gamers “will appreciate that the Steam Controller’s resolution approaches that of a desktop mouse,” and goes as far to promise that the controller makes games that aren't traditionally suited to playing from the couch--RTSes, 4X games, simulations, and others--controller-friendly. To compensate for the trackpads’ nature as less-tangible input devices than conventional analog sticks, Steam Controller includes “dual linear resonant actuators” that produce vibration. Valve adds that the controller can serve as a speaker. What seems to distinguish the Steam Controller’s square touch screen from other touch screens is click functionality. “Actions are not invoked by a simple touch, they instead require a click. This allows a player to touch the screen, browse available actions, and only then commit to the one they want,” Valve states in the announcement. Although Valve was vague on how it plans to implement this policy, it emphasized the openness of the device. \"We plan to make tools available that will enable users to participate in all aspects of the experience, from industrial design to electrical engineering. We can’t wait to see what you come up with,\" Valve says. We'll await details on price, materials, and an opportunity to try Steam Controller ourselves soon. Snuck into the very end of the announcement is a mention of Steam Machines and SteamOS, the prototype of which Valve says it will share \"detailed specs\" of next week. In the meantime, you can become eligible to beta test Steam Controller by following the same steps outlined for the Steam Machines beta.",

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/09/24/steamos-the-pros-and-cons/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The pros and cons of SteamOS\"> </a> By announcing SteamOS yesterday, Valve declared that PC gaming is more than desktop gaming, that Windows is not our master, and that—finally—cats can own Steam accounts. The free, Linux-based, cat-friendly operating system is designed for gaming on living room PCs, because PC gaming according to Valve isn't about WASD and DirectX—it's about openness and collaboration. We're free to choose our hardware, our software, our mods, and soon more than ever, how we play, where we play, and whether or not Microsoft gets a cut. If SteamOS takes off, PC gaming will undergo one of its most dramatic changes ever—possibly one more significant than the introduction of the free-to-play model and crowdfunding. That's thrilling, but also scary as hell, so we've worked through our fears with a list of SteamOS pros and cons, followed by deep breaths in anticipation of tomorrow's announcement. The Pros &nbsp; It's free. If you have a living room PC, or plan to build one, you can ditch Windows for free. That feels really good to say, but the adoption rate hinges on SteamOS launching with native support for everything we want in a media and gaming center. Streaming games from a secondary PC is neat, but we'd rather run them natively on the machine we paid to put in our living room. It also needs native Netflix and Hulu apps, and all the other media services offered by the consoles. Valve says it's got this covered, announcing that it's \"working with many of the media services you know and love,\" and that \"hundreds of great games are already running natively on SteamOS,\" with native \"AAA titles\" to be announced in the coming weeks. It encourages competition in the console market. May the best Steam Box win! Windows isn't designed for TVs, so neither are many PCs. Now Valve is giving away a platform for games, movies, and music, challenging hardware manufacturers to make systems that are powerful, quiet, and inexpensive. It used to be Microsoft vs. Sony vs. Nintendo fighting for the top of the living room ecosystem's food chain—soon it may be Microsoft vs. Sony vs. Nintendo vs. Everyone. It should run some games better. One of the few advantages consoles have over PCs (whether or not they always make the best of it) is an OS specifically designed for gaming. Meanwhile, we have Windows, which is clearly not designed to be an ideal gaming platform. With SteamOS, however, Valve claims it has \"achieved significant performance increases in graphics processing,\" and is now working on \"audio performance and reductions in input latency at the operating system level.\" Last year, Valve posted a performance test of Left 4 Dead 2 running on Windows 7 and on Ubuntu, and the Linux build came out ahead, saying that the test \"speak to the underlying efficiency of the kernel and OpenGL.\" This isn't close to being an objective experiment—and we'll look forward to making our own evaluations—but it is encouraging. It means more Linux games, and more couch-friendly PC games. SteamOS is as much about ditching Windows as it is putting PC gaming in the living room, so it affects even those firmly planted in their desk chairs. If SteamOS achieves the install base it needs for developers big and small embrace Linux, the Microsoft shackles may be broken forever. The Cons &nbsp; Steam Boxes may struggle to compete in price. A PC designed to run SteamOS skips over the Windows fee, but unlike a console, the manufacturer can't rely on game licensing fees to recoup costs—that money goes to Valve. Sony and Microsoft, however, can price their consoles competitively with that revenue in mind, which gives them the advantage. Valve itself could price hardware this way, but that would undercut third-party hardware manufacturers and could turn out to be anti-competitive. Unless, of course, Valve makes the unlikely move to subsidize the cost of these systems. It could increase development costs. Major game developers aren't going to ditch Windows, the platform with the world's largest install base. If SteamOS becomes a competitive gaming platform, competitive developers will have yet another version to make, soaking up more resources. The pessimistic angle is that this can only result in either lower quality games or more expensive games. The optimistic angle is that SteamOS will be embraced and prioritized by developers with the same enthusiasm as the consoles. It could further fragment games and smother certain genres. If SteamOS eclipses the popularity of desktop gaming, developers will have less incentive to develop desktop games. Just as developers rushed into mobile and Facebook development, we could see a flood of controller-based Steam games that push niche and classic-style PC games into the slums. It's a scary thought, but when we un-jerk our knees and really consider this scenario, it's a very minor concern. Crowdfunding has proven without a doubt that there's still a huge appetite for old fashioned mouse and keyboard PC games. The positive—and more likely—angle is that we'll see just greater diversity in the Steam library. It gives Valve even more power over PC gaming. Valve isn't PC gaming. We know that, and millions of League of Legends players, World of Tanks enthusiasts, GOG.com users, modders, and more know that. But Steam is the most popular digital distribution service, and soon, it will be a platform. SteamOS may be free, but it's only as open as Valve allows. We don't know yet if we can use SteamOS to play non-Steam games, or if Valve will make exclusivity deals. We've asked, and Valve's answer will be a huge indicator of its intentions. If you've got a passionate thought about SteamOS, we'd love to include it in our next issue of PC Gamer. We're always listening at letters@pcgamer.com.",

For a $6/£3.50 downpayment, you'll secure official server access to each user-made map in casual, deathmatch and - for the first time - competitive modes. As with Payback, Operation Bravo also supplies buyers with an event coin that displays next to their avatar. The coin can be upgraded through playtime and wins, and grants access to a scorecard, which tracks competitive performance throughout the duration of the event, on both Bravo and regular maps. And look, there's more. The Bravo pass also grants access to 15 map-themed weapon skins, which will drop periodically during play. Special Bravo-themed cases have also been created, and will get delivered to players' inventories, whether they own a Bravo pass or not. The new maps for the event are Agency, Ali, Cache, Chinatown, Gwalior, Ruins and Siege. Bravo also includes the return of Seaside. Of course, as with Payback, all maps are currently available through the Steam Workshop, with the pass making them playable on official servers until the end of the event on January 20th. For more details, see the CS:GO blog's Operation Bravo page.",

The new weapon skins will drop randomly while you play CS:GO, much like new items in Team Fortress 2. Unlike TF2, all of the modifications are purely cosmetic. You will also occasionally find weapon cases, similar to TF2's crates, which must be opened by a key. These come in two styles: standard variety, and a special eSports case. The proceeds from eSports case keys will go towards larger prize pools and greater visibility for competitive CS:GO. It's not all just paint jobs and microtransactions, though. We're also seeing the return of the silenced variants for the M4A1 and the USP, which feature a smaller price tag and magazine size than their louder brethren. Arms Deal is available now, and you can read more about it on the official announcement page.",

Which isn't to say they're planning another 30 days of making prank phone calls to the offices of EA's Origin - that's the other Operation Payback. This one is the reward scheme for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive mapmakers, giving players the chance to remunerate the community creators for their contributions to the game. Originally due to retreat on July 31st, the programme will now run until the end of August. In exchange for the $5.99 contribution, buyers of the Payback pass get official dedicated server access to the seven chosen maps over the course of the event. The maps included are Museum, Downtown, Library, Thunder, Favela, Seaside and Motel. Since the scheme's launch in April, a total of $150,000 has been paid out to the mapmakers involved. While this first Operation Payback will now close on August 31st, Valve have announced that they're already looking for the next wave of creators to showcase. \"We’re looking at a great list of maps that we hope to include in the next operation,\" they write. \"If you’ve been working on a map, now is the time to make sure it’s in the workshop and getting votes!\" You can currently access the Operation: Payback pass for a discounted price of $0.99.

Payback, you'll remember, is Valve's attempt to 'pay back' the game's dedicated community by offering unlimited access to seven of its best user maps, and dedicated servers on which to play them, for a flat $5.99 fee. Considering the creators of those seven maps now have around $150,000 to share between them, I'd say it's proved rather successful. The operation ends July 31st, but I hope it's an initiative Valve will return to in the future, especially considering how successful it's been. They did something similar with TF2 with the Robotic Boogaloo pack, which raised nearly $250,000 for 66 item creators. It's an increasingly lucrative business, this modding lark - and richly deserved, considering how much talent and effort the top creators put in.",

From today until July 22nd, daily deals and flash sales will flood the Steam store with prices that are lower than the usual prices. To get the best deals, you may want to be patient and gamble on there being heavier discounts as the sale goes on—a good way to pass the time is to chart prices across a giant blackboard, mixing in the Fibonacci sequence now and then and muttering about \"Gabentropy.\" Currently, you can get BioShock Infinite for $30/£17.50, Counter-Strike: GO for $5.09/£4.07, Hotline Miami for $2.49/£1.74, and tons of other crazy dumb deals. You can also vote on the Community's Choice sale every eight hours—the currently leading game is something called \"Heavy Load.\" ",

In other true facts, I'm already hearing from users playing the Steam marketplace to profit off the cards' initial popularity. One user I spoke to has been buying low and selling high to pad his Steam wallet, even creating scarcity by buying up low-value cards in quantity. I'll keep an eye on marketplace prices as more users start trading the collectibles.

This might be because of the growing tournament scene associated with CS:GO, but it could also be because of the ample developer support. The latest patch for the game has brought de_mirage into the map pool, added an “sv_grenade_trajectory” console command and fiddled with Overwatch and the UI. Operation Payback Passes are also on sale for $0.99 until Monday. Like the other classic maps that have been added to CS:GO, de_mirage is coming back to the game with a few changes. Valve explains the overarching vision was \"to improve the readability and graphics of Mirage without losing any of the gameplay, jumps, corners, timings and balance that has made it so incredibly playable for three generations of Counter-Strike players.\" Valve has also added visual arcs for grenade throws that are only available in servers that have cheats enabled. Put “sv_grenade_trajectory 1” into the console on a server that has “sv_cheat 1” enabled and you’ll see indicators that should help you learn to bank grenades for maximum effect. One particularly noteworthy change is the restoration of the “retry” console command. I've personally felt the pain of not having an easy way to reconnect to a server that you've just disconnected from. Typing “retry” into the console will zap you back into the last server that you were connected to and has been a staple of both Source and 1.6. The full patch notes are below. Maps Added de_mirage. Added console command to help players plan strategic grenades. Set sv_grenade_trajectory 1 (cheat convar) to see a visual arc in-game. Overwatch Overwatch Investigators are now required to submit more detailed verdict reports after reviewing evidence. Fixed interpolation issues during GOTV and Overwatch demo playback which caused the weapon of a shooting player to visually appear several ticks behind the moment a victim was hit. Overwatch FAQ updated. http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/ Operation Payback Operation Payback Pass on sale for $0.99 until Monday 6/17. UI Added links to top streams on the main menu. Added an audio option to reduce game music volume when Steam Overlay is activated. Misc Restored the \"retry\" console command. Players can only submit griefing reports for teammates. Thanks, PCGamesN.",

Well, it's not so much a documentary as it is a well-produced video of pro players laying down the heat against other teams, but it's still a pretty good way to spend 18 minutes. If defusing bombs isn't your thing, Copenhagen Games also offers tournaments for StarCraft II, League of Legends, and other competitive multiplayer games. It's always fun to see how people who train for a certain game play compared to casual players, and then quietly sob in a corner after being awed by their skills. If you said \"They aren't that good,\" while watching the video, Copenhagen Games will return next year between April 16-20. All you need are some decent teammates, sponsors, and ruthless tenacity.",

Well done, you have chosen, or been chosen, to take part in our little experiment: the RPS Staring Eye of Judgement will, eventually, monitor your every move to ensure that when you sit down and make a comment on the site that you&#8217;ve made the <em>correct</em> decisions in life up to that point. I say &#8220;eventually&#8221;, because right now it&#8217;s just a helium balloon with an eye drawn on it. Could you just drag it around and pretend, maybe making whirring and clicking noises?

It will allow certain experienced players to review reports of \"disruptive behaviour\", watch replays, and issue temporary bans where necessary. Naturally, Valve have called this program \"Overwatch\", which was also the title of the transhuman Combine soldiers of Half-Life 2. Not that there are any parallels. This is just an enforcement squad, working under a larger body that has ultimate power over... Oh... Valve explain how the Overwatch will function in a post about the now-live beta. \"Prospective Overwatch Investigators are presented with an active Overwatch button in the main menu, which indicates that there is a pending case for them to evaluate. The investigators can then choose to participate by watching a replay (eight rounds’ worth or roughly 10 minutes) and selecting a verdict. \"If the investigators collectively agree that an offense has occurred, a ban will be issued. The ban duration will depend on the severity of the offense and the suspect’s history of convictions, if any.\" Investigators are selected around a variety of conditions, including account age, game time, and a low report history. And the more an Overwatch member participates, and the higher their resulting accuracy, the more weight their decisions will carry in the future. For now, though, the scheme is just being trialled. Overwatch cases will be reviewed and analysed before any bans are enforced, giving Valve the chance to ensure they aren't creating a force of power-mad storm troopers. You can read the full details of the Overwatch program here.",

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should stop, just that we shouldn't single Black Ops out. Surely there are other icky contractions to find. For instance, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, which were currently letting off lightly with the totally normal CS:GO. I say we start calling it GlobOff instead. Whatever we choose, it's having a free weekend on Steam. You can install it now by clicking these words. In addition to the trial, the game is also on sale, making it $7.50/£5.99 until Monday. It's a price just low enough that it might tempt the most committed of card traders, now that that's a thing Steam does. On the plus side, the influx of newbies might make me look halfway competent for once. So see you in Globoff. Nope, I've gone off it already.",

He admits they were testing Bitcoin integration, to \"determine whether it was a feature that we might want to add in the future.\" Ultimately, Torbull says, they decided against it. He goes to claim that \"an employee who was involved in the test has been using the test code for his own personal gain since April 13, 2013.\" \"The owners and management at ESEA all apologize to each of you that were impacted by the recent events and intend to make things right,\" Torbull continues. \"ESEA has issued a free month of ESEA Premium to all of our community members who were enrolled in Premium for the month of April. We also ask anyone who has experienced any physical damage to their computers to open an ESEA support ticket. \"In an effort to maintain complete transparency, we have released all of the Bitcoin wallet addresses as well as data dumps of the wallets themselves. The value of the mined Bitcoins was $3,713.55 and ESEA will be donating 100% of the $3,713.55 to the American Cancer Society. ESEA will also match 100% of this amount for a total of $7,427.10 donated. ESEA is also increasing the Season 14 League prize pot by $3,713.55.\" Original Story: Multiplayer eSports network ESEA was found to have malware in its anti-cheat client, which used users' graphics cards to mine for Bitcoins. Information about the exploit was posted to the ESEA's forums by user \"ENJOY ESEA SHEEP\", who found he had been unwittingly farming Bitcoins for someone in the community after noticing excessively high idle GPU usage. Mining is the legitimate, and deliberately system-intensive process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger - generating Bitcoins for the miner in the process. The ESEA client had been pooling the GPUs of users in order to generate more money for wallets held by ESEA staff. ESEA co-founder Eric ‘lpkane’ Thunberg responded to the accusation, initially claiming it was a mistakenly released April Fool's joke. His first statement is kind of amazing: \"Lol that got aggressive quickly. \"Back towards the end of march, as BTC was skyrocketing, Jaguar and I were talking about how cool it would be if we could use massive amounts of GPUs logged into the client to mine. \"We went back and forth about it, considered doing something for April fools, didn't get it done in time, and eventually elected to put some test code in the client and try it on a few admin accounts, ours included. \"We ran the test for a few days on our accounts, decided it wasn't worth the potential drama, and pulled the plug, or so we thought. \"Fast forward to 48 hours ago, a fuck up in the client server results in a restart which results in a setting getting changed which enables it for all idle users, and here we are.\" Thunberg claimed the combined efforts of ESEA users' unaware mining netted them roughly 2BTC, or $280, which he promised would be put towards the Season 14 prize pot. He returned with a second statement a few hours later, after users pointed out that anti-viruses had been flagging the client for longer than the claimed 48 hours. He admits the mining had been part of the client since 14th April, and that the overall money mined totaled $3,602.21, before going to say: \"So first the bad news, this is way more shady than I originally thought, and as the person who is ultimately responsible for everything it's 100% my fault. \"Now the good news, as of the client update released in the last hour, all the BTC stuff is out which should solve the GPU and AV warnings.\" Thunberg once again promised to use the now substantially higher total as part of the Season 14 prize pot, and that - as recompense for the additional strain that's been placed on user's GPUs - would gift a free one month Premium code for Premium account holders. He finished by saying, \"once again, our bad, thanks for keeping us honest.\" Thanks, Cadred and PCGamesN.",

Most notably, CTs have now adopted the tactical doctrine of draping hostages across their shoulders like a squishy scarf, and only a single rescue is needed to secure a win for the good guys. You'll need to interact with a hostage for a lengthy four seconds to get him to hop on for a ride, and a new \"rescue kit\" shortens pickup time to a single second by presumably wowing hostages with attractively padded and comfortable-looking shoulder guards to rest on. Taking a note of influence from community-made maps such as cs_motel, hostage spawns are now randomized per match. Valve is also continuing to stock GO's maps with updated versions of classic Counter-Strike levels, with cs_militia being the latest addition. It's structured similarly to cs_assault, where Ts benefit from an entrenched interior location to bunker in while CTs attempt rescue through multiple points of entry. Defusing bombs got a small but significant change as well: turning too far away from a bomb while defusing it will cancel the process, a jump in risk and exposure for CTs trying for the win while Ts yet linger to guard the bomb. They could sure use one of those hostage-capes for extra protection. Oh, and the rumored Support Pass for a community map rotation on official servers isn't happening. Valve even pokes fun at earlier reports of the pass with a new data string, \"CSGO_Ticket_CommunitySeasonOneSpring2013_Leak,\" and its single-word description: \"lol.\" Oh, Valve. Don't ever change. See the rest of the patch notes over on Steam.",

We've got a nice stack of them running on our own server, and Valve is evidently looking to copy that setup on its own servers. Data-divers of reddit have found mention of a \"Support Pass\" in the next patch for players to purchase and access a pool of community maps soon to join the official server rotation. A list of new data strings found in the patch mentions a \"Community Support Pass Season One\" to \"grant access to Season One's featured community maps on official servers.\" The proceeds are distributed evenly to map contributors in what's likely an incentive to encourage an increasingly large selection of maps to feature. The data doesn't mention a price, but Valve has a similar system in place with Team Fortress 2's co-op Mann vs. Machine mode, where players access multi-map sessions by purchasing $0.99 tickets. Assuming GO's passes carry a similar cost, it should result in a relatively simple way to jump into high-quality custom battles for little effort. The patch is expected to hit this week, so we'll have a clearer understanding of Valve's plans soon enough.",

Instead of a kitchen, de_dolls_csgo takes us into a heavily pink bedroom which I assume is the property of a little girl, but the power of pink is genderless. Just like in rats, the jumbo furniture provides multiple nooks and alcoves for plinking across the map, including a doll house with furniture and a duct passage for moving around without exposing yourself to the AWPer's paradise of the main bedroom floor.

Presumably momentarily distracted by accepting a trophy modeled after a smirking face, a bewhiskered Newell fielded some interview questions over the normally airtight subject of Valve's business performance that hinted at the monumental scale of the studio's prosperity. Newell chalked up Valve's successes largely to user-generated content on open platforms such as Steam Workshop before sharing some jaw-dropping numbers. \"There's sort of an insatiable demand for gaming right now,\" Newell said. \"I think our business has grown by about 50 percent on the back of opportunities created by having these open platforms. \"And just so people understand how big this sort of scale is getting, we were generating 3.5 terabits per second during the last Dota 2 update,\" he added. \"That's about 2 percent of all the mobile- and land-based Internet activity.\" Wait, what? We're not exactly sure what Newell meant when he dropped that bombshell of data info, apart from maybe claiming responsibility for all those times my connection speeds chugged while browsing these past few months. Still, it seems entirely plausible—Dota 2 has a lot of players, and the MOBA recently took the crown for the highest concurrent user amount of any Steam game ever. If any Steam game can feasibly take a bite out of the entire Internet, Dota 2 holds the best chance.",

Because why the hell not? Our weeks-old, St. Louis-based CS:GO server has hosted lively Steam events about twice a week. We run custom maps exclusively because the community has somehow produced 1,000 of them for CS:GO since adding Steam Workshop support last month. I earmarked my early favorites in February, but new favorites have already emerged, like the cs_sauna remake. How to join, in four extremely simple steps Join the PC Gamer Steam Group to be notified of events Subscribe to our CS:GO Steam Workshop map collection (this will auto-download and auto-update the maps we run on our server through Steam—MAXIMUM CONVENIENCE!) Join the server (\"PC Gamer | The Psychedelic Den of Map Experimentation,\" IP: 8.6.76.59:27015) around 7 PM PST / 10 PM EST Have fun; be the kind of person you'd like to play games with Thanks to GameServers for being a darn good server provider. If there's a config setting you'd like changed or a map you'd like to see in the rotation, just let me know or leave a comment on the Steam Workshop collection. Messages sent to evan@pcgamer.com stir my spinal community antennae implant. And yes, we know CS:GO isn't the only game in the universe. But we've got a good thing going there, and I'd rather do a slow roll-out of community funtimes than expand things too quickly. Look for more games and events to pop up throughout the year.",

By all means, recommend maps that I should take a gander at. (de_library, which released on Monday, is at the top of my list.) de_seaside Compact and straightforward, this is CS:GO’s best custom map. The CTs are steps away from covering both bombsites, so the onus is on the Terrorist team to find creative ways to draw attention, distract, or outright outgun their opponents. I love the waterworn surfaces that cover the dock setting—they remind me of The Parish from Left 4 Dead 2. Bombsite B itself is a miniature siege—a long wooden bridge (and another that passes underneath it) are the most direct routes for the Terrorists, and any would-be bomb-planters taking this path need to be covered from the dock, where snipers can protect themselves behind large boxes as they line up shots on B. Separating A and B is a hazardous middle lane that represents a high-risk flanking route for both teams. Download de_seaside de_conduit Conduit is conventional and damn good. Like Seaside, its rectangular layout offers a left, right, and sniper-friendly middle lane for both teams. Unlike it, Conduit feels suited (as creator ds- describes) for competitive play. Bombsite B is a choked concrete room with an aluminum ledge that sits right above the planting point like a hat. Securing B relies on an aggressive push from the Terrorists, encouraging some members of Team T to die for the cause so they can secure a foothold on that side of the map. A is a more open construction yard—a secret tunnel in the middle provides a secondary route to it from the middle of the map. Vibrant colors (yellow paint, neon red and green lights, contrasting light and darkness) give Conduit character against the odds of its industrial setting. Download de_conduit de_cache Cache’s flat, three-lane layout is the handiwork of competitive CS legend Salvatore “Volcano” Garozzo. Its industrial setting borders on boring, but terrific balance compensates. Cache features a middle lane similar to Seaside and Conduit—a coverless no-man’s-land that’s treacherous to cross and can be ignored entirely, but one that opens up flanking routes to both bombsites if you push through. Bombsite B is overlooked by a nest that CTs have ladder access to, and I love the way fights play out here when Terrorists pop a smoke grenade to make an aggressive entrance into B. Download de_cache cs_museum Museum is GO’s most gorgeous map. Outside, stone arches overlook a street entrance lined with gardens. Inside, golden light filters through an atrium onto carpeted stairs, a T-rex skeleton, and scaffolding. Creator Shawn “FMPONE” Snelling called upon fellow modders to build custom assets for the map, and the extra help is evident in every corner. In the nearly 50 rounds I’ve played so far, Museum has favored the Terrorists. Raised windows, scaffolding, and an elevator shaft give the Ts some great vantage points for getting the drop on the CT assaulters who spawn outdoors. Snelling wrote a terrific explanation of his design decisions on Museum (and the research that informed them) for Mapcore.org. Download cs_museum cs_motel It’s a novelty map, but in lieu of a worthy, ridiculous successor to de_rats (de_rats_ol_shack for CS:GO hasn’t impressed me), Motel has been a huge hit on our server, and our go-to for unserious Counter-Striking. Two floors of cramped bedrooms open out into a parking lot and small swimming pool. Four hostages spawn randomly in the rooms, and most rounds play out like hide-and-seek. The Terrorists have an incentive to camp the rooms that hostages spawn in, but this is mitigated slightly by hostages only appearing on the CTs’ radar. I also like that Motel makes shotguns preferable to rifles and SMGs. Download cs_motel cs_parkhouse_go A port from CS:S, Parkhouse hands the CTs a dozen different sniping options from a rock ledge that hugs one side of the map’s centerpiece, a two-floor modern house moated by a lake. Two pairs of hostages are isolated on a top and bottom floor. With scoped weapons, the CTs have a serious advantage, but there are moments of fun in this asymmetrical siege map that remind me of classics cs_assault and cs_militia. Against the threat of sniping, turtling is usually the best option for the Terrorists, and things get wonderfully messy when the CTs are forced to take the fight indoors. I wouldn’t call Parkhouse balanced, but I've enjoyed it. Download cs_parkhouse_go ",

Click for download link. More people—maybe twice as many—seem to be playing the original version of Counter-Strike than Global Offensive. Look here. Why hasn't CS:GO inherited its elders' popularity? I'd blame the map drought GO has experienced. New official maps have been hard to come by since the game launched in August, and the fresh ones introduced by GO were restricted to Demolition and Arms Race modes. Adding CS:GO to Steam Workshop is one step toward a healthier multiplayer scene. Debuting today, the Maps Workshop has 157 entries at the moment, including remakes of stuff like de_piranesi, fy_iceworld, and fy_pool_day, which I have vague-but-fond memories of playing in LAN cafes. Pop over to the CS:GO Map Workshop to start downloading directly through Steam. After that, you'll have to find a server hosting matches on the levels you've downloaded. Alternatively, you can take a map for a spin with bots by typing \"map \" in console.",

In its initial response to the tragedy in Newtown, CT, the US government said it intends to ask the Centers for Disease Control to “study the root causes of gun violence, including any relationship to video games and media images.” Critics cite studies that link aggression and violent games, claiming that interactivity as a component of games makes them unusually potent. One politician labeled games as \"electronic child molesters.\" It's an enormous and serious topic—one that we believe gamers shouldn't shrug off, but take it upon themselves to engage critics and fellow citizens on. In the interest of that, Logan, Evan, and Tyler hopped into our podcast studio (inappropriately, the room that most makes it look like we're inside an insane asylum) to talk about their personal relationship with violence in games.",

The CT's incendiary grenade remains $850. - Note that the pistol arrangement has changed in the buymenu. - The messaging system has been converted to protobuf. - Demos recorded with previous versions of CS:GO will not be compatible as of this update. In order to view old demos, set your 'beta' to 'demo_viewer' in the CS:GO betas property panel, in Steam. Don't forget to set it back to 'NONE' when you want to play online again. - If you are running SourceMod on your server, you will need to update to the latest version. For details, see: http://www.sourcemod.net/index.php - Added some performance improvements for low-end clients. - Fixed some fence materials that were allowing players to see through smoke grenades. - GOTV spectator UI will now correctly show kevlar and helmet information for players. - Avatars will now correctly load for all players when connected to a GOTV server or when watching a demo. - Added support to notify players during servers maintenance downtime. - Fixed a dedicated server exploit where community dedicated servers could masquerade as official and get players searching for official game modes connected to them (saigns.de) - Fixed a rare problem when clients matchmaking for Classic Competitive game could be stuck on green Accept screen - Fixed a rare problem when clients could connect to a Classic Competitive game and then later be disconnected for failing to accept the match. - Improved algorithm pinging whitelisted dedicated servers when searching for Classic Competitive games, pinging less addresses fixes occasional problems for some customers where address translation tables on their routers would fill up and their routers would fail to route required packets to display the green Accept screen. - Added support for mm_dedicated_search_maxping to restrict client's ping when matchmaking for Classic Competitive games. ( Matchmaking algorithm will still be prioritizing best servers to minimize ping of all party members. ) - Fixed a rare server crash when bots attempted to shoot the bomb defuser. - Fixed a client crash when downloading a lot of custom assets from community servers. - DEATHMATCH: - Deathmatch uses the nav mesh to create spawn points. Make sure that your nav is contained within the bounds of your map to ensure that players aren't spawned outside of it. Use map_showspawnpoints to see where spawn points were generated. - If you want to use mapper-placed spawnpoints instead of the randomly generated ones, place an info_map_parameters in your map and set usenormalspawnsfordm (\"Use Normal Spawns in Deathmatch?) to true. - WORKSHOP: - We're launching the private beta for workshop maps. If you're a map maker, mail csgo_sdk@list.valvesoftware.com with the subject \"Map Workshop Beta\" and your steam id in the content, with a link to maps shipped ( or maps in progress ) suitable for the Workshop. - Please use the CSGO SDK list for discussions about Deathmatch and Workshop.

You can nab ShadowZack's works through Far Cry 3's in-game multiplayer map search simply by typing his name. You'll find Battlefield 3's Noshahr Canals and Wake Island, Counter-Strike's Dust and Aztec, and Call of Duty's Nuketown all carefully recreated right down to the placement of crates and convenient slabs of concrete cover. ShadowZack also released some flyby and progress videos for the maps as they were constructed, which you can watch below. Far Cry 3 itself has two gigantic jungle island environments. We got lost. We shot animals. We drank weird potions. We wrote a review, so have a look. ",

This postpones the post-match level change by the tv_delay amount to ensure that the broadcast to GOTV clients is complete. NOTE: Manually quitting the server or changing the level while the broadcast is still ongoing will kill the feed to all GOTV relays and GOTV clients and your spectators will miss the end of the match.

To use it as intended, I'd have to run an exceptionally long HDMI cable from my bedroom to my TV and use a wireless controller, but I'm starting to think a mid-range PC in a small case might look real nice in my living room. In the meantime, I'll just use it to launch Peggle from bed. Along with the launch, the Steam store has been overrun with \"controller-friendly\" deals. I'm distressed by the inclusion of Left 4 Dead 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in the list—just because they can be played with a controller doesn't mean they should be—but my typical WASD elitism aside, a sale is a sale. Mark of the Ninja seems more appropriate to me, and I've been enjoying it a ton. At least, I was, until PlanetSide 2 happened, but I'll go back once this match is over. It does end, right?",

Steam, Amazon, Blizzard, and more have kicked off Consumer Season by booby trapping the web with potent spending bait such as 33% off XCOM: Enemy Unknown, 50% off The Walking Dead, and 66% off StarCraft II. We spent the morning stumbling through the minefield to compile a list of some of the best seasonal discounts, but stay vigilant: more surprise server-busters are bound to go live as we approach the spendiest weekend of the year. Steam: Like the Summer Sale, the Steam Autumn Sale rotates deals daily, with even more fleeting Flash Sales lasting only 10 to 15 hours, so serious shoppers should check in at least twice a day. As a bonus, you get to follow Steam's adorable doodle story: currently, it seems a turkey is being forced to enter a Felix Baumgartner-inspired high diving competition. But don't just look at the front page: Steam isn't promoting most of its deals, so scan the full list now and then. Here are some of the better discounts at the time of writing: 33% off XCOM: Enemy Unknown - $33.49 / £20.09 50% off The Walking Dead - $12.49 / £10.49 25% off Borderlands 2 - $44.99 / £22.49 75% off ARMA II: Combined Operations - $17.99 / £14.99 25% off Dishonored - $44.99 / £22.49 50% off Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - $11.24 / £8.99 33% off The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - $40.19 / £23.44 75% off Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - $2.49 / £1.74 75% off Limbo - $2.49 / £1.74 25% off Torchlight II - $14.99 / £11.24 75% off Cave Story+ - $2.49 / £1.74 More Steam Deals Amazon: (Some deals are region-specific) Amazon hasn't been quite as liberal as Steam with the big games, but it has conjured a storm of Lightning Deals on desktop PCs, components, and peripherals. The scattershot selection below should give you an idea of what to expect. HARDWARE: 17% off iBuyPower AM699 Desktop - $579.99 18% off CyberpowerPC GUA890 Desktop - $499.99 39% off Dell S2330MX 23\" Ultra-Slim VGA Monitor - $139.99 40% off Samsung Series S24B30BL 23.6-Inch Screen LCD Monitor - $119.99 33% off Corsair Vengeance C70 Mid Tower Case - $97.45 31% off Logitech Optical Gaming Mouse G400 - $34.49 19% off Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse - $64.62 GAMES: 50% off The Walking Dead - $12.49 (Steam code) 80% off Dungeon Defenders - $2.99 10% off Hitman: Absolution - $44.99 75% off all Assassin's Creed games (excluding Assassin's Creed III) More Amazon Deals Blizzard: Blizzard has joined the party with Diablo III for $40 / £33 and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty for $20 / £17. GOG: GOG's current sale nets you five games from a list of 20 for a mere $10 (just over £6). The list is loaded with some great indie adventure and puzzle games, so if you don't already own them, now's a good time to prepare for that \"it's cold outside, so I'm going to drink tea (whiskey optional) and not leave my screen for the next forever hours\" feeling. Green Man Gaming: While Green Man doesn't celebrate consumerism with a morbid-sounding Friday, it is offering its usual voucher code. Enter GMG20-1FYLZ-EDG8R when purchasing a PC download for 20% off any game, except those already on sale. At the time of writing, GMG's daily deal (North America only) is Mass Effect 3: N7 Digital Deluxe for $15.99. Newegg: (US and Puerto Rico only) Newegg has taken this whole \"Black Friday\" thing awfully far. Not only has it preempted Black Friday with \"Black November,\" it's re-preempting it with a Pre-Black Friday Frenzy sale. How about a 500 GB Western Digital WD Blue hard drive for $50? A Samsung B350 Series LED monitor for $180? Keep in mind that if you visit Newegg from now until December 1st, you should not expect to then purchase other things, like food. If you find any great deals as the weekend progresses, we'd love it if you shared them in the comments. And if all these sales combined with a poorly-timed lack of funds has you feeling down, remember that buying stuff is only briefly thrilling, while instead you could be continuously thrilled by PlanetSide 2, MechWarrior Online, Tribes: Ascend, or many of the other new free-to-play games we're thankful for this year.",

As part of Valve's Pro Tip video series, Larivière spills the bullets on the best uses of a sniper's superior oversight, when each of the two zoom levels come most in handy, and how shooting the legs off a careless opponent equates to a high-caliber \"tsk-tsk.\" The real secret of a successful AWPer, however, probably lies with mastering quickswitch tics in a cacophony of deployment noises, as Larivière's lightspeed weapon swapping both defies and defines efficiency. Its mesmerizing effect probably lulls unaware victims into an easy kill like a rubber-armed spider.",

All weekend you can play the complete game. CS:GO is more than just the best looking CS. We have expanded the game with new characters, new weapons, new maps, and new game modes. So you don’t get overwhelmed, let’s break down the game modes and give you a suggestion on where to start based on your skill level. For everyone, a good first stop is the Weapon Course where you will get some quick tips and training on new mechanics. If you have never played a first person shooter – first, what’s wrong with you? You have been missing out. A good intro that isn’t about map strategy, team goals, etc – is Arms Race. It’s pretty simple. Kill the guys who don’t look like you. Every time you kill one, you get a new weapon. There are some things that happen at the end with a knife if you are the top player in kills, but do you really think that is going to happen? Okay, let’s pretend it does. You get a golden knife – then what? Stab a guy and win the game. If you do that, you better take a screen shot and <a href='http://steamcommunity.com/app/730/screenshots'>post it on the CS:GO Game Hub</a> – otherwise no one will believe you. If you do actually play first person shooters but maybe haven’t played much Counter-Strike or it has been a bit – try Demolition Mode. These are small intense maps that remove the buy round at the start and throw players right into the action. Plant the bomb, defuse the bomb, kill a guy – it all helps. Has it been a while since you last played CS? The franchise has existed for 12 years, so at this point you could have last played in 6th grade and since graduated college, gotten married, and had your first kid by now – so we’ll excuse your rusty skills if you are bouncing the new kid on your lap as you play. A word of warning on that - don’t play Competitive Mode if you think you need to drop out mid-game or just want to drop in and out of games, instead play Casual Mode. It is classic Counter-Strike with some relaxed rules on purchasing weapons and we leave all talk on so players can chat while playing. Are you a CS player? Think you have what it takes to win but have been scared to try CS:GO? If you think you are up for it – jump into Competitive Mode. This is where it is all about skill, win 10 matches and you will get put into a <a href=\"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2012/10/5565/\">Skill Group</a>, keep winning and you’ll be placed into a higher Skill Group, lose and you might get placed lower.

CS:GO is free. Download it. Play it. Love it. It’s free. Who knows, we might even put it on sale if you want to keep playing after this weekend,\" say Valve. They've recently updated their spectator tools with GOTV, an in-game service that should let you check out the pro action happening in Paris this weekend. If you're suitably inspired, you can start climbing the ranks and taking on CS regulars. If you've never played Counter-Strike before, you won't have to worry too much about running into crack sharpshooters right away. \"Ranked players will only meet Free Weekend players skilled enough to climb into their skill group.\" In the meantime, Valve have put out another Pro Tip video to give you a head start while the client downloads.

Yet, for a platform housing exploding horses, rug-cutting Combine, and the nesting-doll appeal of Minecraft's game-in-a-game sandbox, the PC keeps its lot of closed environments precipitated by developers and publishers as a means for balanced gameplay or brand protection. In an interview with True PC Gaming, Black Mesa Project Lead Carlos Montero flatly stated such a hindrance for mod growth \"doesn't make sense.\" \"When you think about it, modders are like the ultimate fans,\" Montero explained. \"They love this game so much, they're doing real, difficult, skilled work that you usually pay people for. Not only that, but they can add so much value to your game for the rest of your audience. Yet you still see companies look at this as competition. They sue and shut down these projects and ignore or drop support for people to mod their games. It doesn't make any sense. In my opinion, it’s the product of businesses (or lawyers) looking at this too analytically and short-term without understanding the long-term value it can create for their games.\" Although Black Mesa earned the silent blessing of Valve during its lengthy session in the testing chamber, other ambitious projects met a not-so-friendly response from license holders legally stifling efforts. Montero's thoughts—the rest of which you can read in the interview—reflect a sentiment by modder-turned-developer Tripwire Interactive expressing confusion over why companies would stop mods on their games.",

The leakage of Valve's employee handbook earlier this year colorfully outlined a flat management structure culturing a counterintuitive emphasis on peer-driven independence. Speaking to Seattle Interactive Conference attendees yesterday (as reported by GeekWire), Valve Product Designer Greg Coomer said the same free-form philosophy governing the company's work ethic also factors into firing someone. \"I wish that we had covered firing in the employee handbook,\" Coomer said. \"It was one of the things that we left out. We tried writing it, but we didn't feel like we were capturing how Valve thinks about (firing) in a well enough way. It was almost a wording problem. We couldn't get it done in the time that we wouldn't to finish the handbook. The short answer of how we handle terminations, really, is the same as we approach all other decisions at the company: It's a peer-driven process. \"If it turns out that we made a bad hiring decision, or that somebody is just not working out, there’s a method we use to get the people who are involved in the same room and to walk through the decision about what should really happen as a result of this person not functioning very well. Some of the details are kind of boring, but the main answer is that it's peer-driven, just like we evaluate each other as peers.” I wonder what a caricaturized \"Termination and You\" chapter in the handbook would look like—probably the Pyro immolating an office chair or something. Still, Coomer attributed Valve's higher rate of self-fulfillment to the significant flexibility it bestows upon its workers, saying, “There are attributes that other companies have quoted about themselves that they allow their (employees) to spend some fraction of their time actually deciding on their own what to work on, but at Valve that percentage of your time is 100 percent. Every single person is responsible for deciding what they do every day.\"",

To use team clan name, all humans should match their Team name in Games->Settings, or the server admin can use the 'mp_teamname_1' and 'mp_teamname_2 convars.' -&nbspAfter halftime, teams no longer switch sides visually on the spectator screen, they now stay where they are and the team colors switch instead. -&nbspCreated a server convar that lets you swap the default player side position manually (CTs on right and T's on left) called mp_spec_swapplayersides. -&nbspMade the hotkey that's assigned to jump to a player not change after half-time. -&nbspYou can now display a country flag next to your custom team name on the spectator scoreboard by setting \"mp_teamflag_1/2\" to ISO Alpha-2 country code of the country you want to display. -&nbspIntroduced \"Skill Groups\", the new Skill Group emblems are now visible in the main menu and at the end of a competitive match. A players' Skill Group will be displayed after they achieve at least 10 competitive match wins. -&nbspReworked conditions of valid match leaving: A vote to concede becomes available to the team that lost a player. Otherwise the match continues. -&nbspNumber of players searching for a competitive match will display number of players compatible with the game type selected by player, for example players searching for \"Dust II\" will see a number of players searching for \"Dust II\" + \"Defuse Mission\", players searching for \"Defuse Mission\" will see sum of all players searching for \"Defuse Mission\" or any specific defuse map, and so on. -&nbspEstimated wait time for a competitive match now more accurately displays wait time based on the game type selected by player. -&nbspAdded Save/Restore of match state. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file ' -- If set then server will save all played rounds information to files with this prefix. Backup file contains players information like KDA, MVPs, cash, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades and match score for first and second halves. In a case of a tournament server crash backup file can be loaded using ' mp_backup_restore_load_file'. The default is 'backup' &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_last' -- Every time a backup file is written the value of this convar gets updated to hold the name of the backup file. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_list_files ' -- Lists recent backup round files matching the prefix, most recent files first, accepts a numeric parameter to limit the number of files displayed (default 5). &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_load_file ' -- Loads the specified backup file and applies players information like KDA, MVPs, cash, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades; sets the match score for first and second half and starts next round. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_pattern,' that defines the pattern for naming backup files using tokens. Example: %prefix%_%date%_%time%_%team1%_%team2%_%map%_round%round%_score_%score1%_%score2%.txt. The default pattern results in 'backup_roundNN.txt' -&nbspWhitelisted 'mp_logdetail' convar. -&nbspAdded convar 'sv_damage_print_enable', that determines whether damage given and received is visible in the console after a player is killed. -&nbspAdded 'cl_bobcycle' to 'sv_competitive_minspec'. It's now restricted to the defauklt 0.98 on servers that have 'sv_competitive_minspec' enabled. -&nbspMade all server cash_ convars notify players when they are changed. -&nbspServers running with sv_pausable 1 will now correctly display 'server paused' UI element on clients when server is paused using 'pause' command. -&nbspAdded mp_spectators_max convar to control how many spectators are allowed in a match. -&nbspAdded convar mp_halftime_pausetimer that will indefinitely pause the halftime timer. -&nbspAdded convar mp_warmup_pausetimer that will pause the warmup period indefinitely. *Warmup periods shorter than 6 seconds cannot be paused. -&nbspPerformance improvements for users running on AMD systems. -&nbspFixed a major performance problem for users running Bitdefender antivirus software. -&nbspFixed two crashes that could happen if you were on a team and went to spectator team. -&nbspFixed the timer display on the hud still showing even when the bomb was planted. -&nbspFixed avatar scaling issues on the spectator hud as well as the issues that would place the player slot avatars offset some distance from where they should be. -&nbspMade some adjustments to the specttor UI and regular hud to account for hud_scaling set really high. Fixed a really bad bug where going from the lobby to a game could prevent players from having input. This would result in not being able to select a team or move around. -&nbspChanged flashbang visual effect in Spectator mode so that it is updated when the target changes. ",

When all 10 players ready-up then the matchmaking servers lock them in for the match.

The sales leaderboard doesn't tell us exactly how many copies a game sold, but it gives us a vague idea of how well certain games are doing on Steam in a given moment. It's an inherently misleading metric—take that as a disclaimer. Still, as we sit in the shadow of some of 2012's biggest releases, I'd like to take a crack at gleaning what we can from this moment in time. 2K's having a great end of the year. The $50 pre-sale of XCOM is outselling everything but Borderlands 2 on Steam. We might be able to chalk that up to fairly generous pre-purchase incentives (which could include a free copy of Civ 5 if enough people pre-buy it). It might be mild evidence that demos still work, too. Borderlands 2's high concurrent user count over the past few days (reaching 123,758 last weekend) is also evidence that 2K will win the weeks connecting September and October on Steam. Digital pre-orders are a thing. XCOM isn't the only thing-you-can-buy-but-can't-play-yet doing well. Joining the unreleased are Dishonored at #7, War of the Roses at #12, Football Manager 2013 at #17, Company of Heroes 2 at #29, and Hitman Absolution at #51. Even though there's no chance of a game going out of stock, Steam users don't seem to mind putting money down in advance, especially if they're rewarded with bonus content or a small discount for doing so. Where are the MMOs? Oh, right. Zero MMOs appear in today's top 100. I might consider that unsurprising—we wouldn't expect too many people to be picking up competitors while Guild Wars 2 and Pandaria are drawing the attention, and neither are available on Steam. Still, it's a little surprising not to see RIFT ($10) or EVE Online: Inferno ($20) popping up anywhere. Call of Duty remains a PC fixture. The sense that Call of Duty remains a fixture for PC gamers is supported by SteamGraph data. Some form of Call of Duty make up 10 whole entries of the Steam's top 100. Many of those are map packs, but the performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops - Mac Edition (#41) is interesting to me. It released yesterday, September 27, and it's outperforming stuff like Civ V: GOTY and Natural Selection 2. Modern Warfare 3 is 50% off until October 1, and it's sitting comfortably at #5. DayZ continues to have a long tail. I don't think Arma 2: Combined Operations (what you need to play DayZ) has left the top ten of Steam's Top Sellers since it caught on in May and June. It seems to be outperforming other games that released in May and June like Sins: Rebellion (#56), Max Payne 3 (#76), Civ 5: Gods &amp; Kings (#20), and Spec Ops: The Line (unlisted). Below: the data, captured at 6:05 PM PDT. Ctrl + Fing encouraged.

        "contents": "<a rel=\"lytebox\" href=\"http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17wvrwji5a7zjjpg/original.jpg\"> </a>What's the big deal about <em>Counter-Strike</em>? Wasn't it just a <em>Half-Life</em> mod? Well that <em>Half-Life</em> mod was so popular that Valve developed it into a standalone, multiplayer first-person shooter. People lost hours of their lives playing version 1.6 of the game. And then when Valve released <em>Counter-Strike: Source</em>, an update to 1.6 that ran on their new Source engine, people lost hours of their lives playing that, too. Now, almost a decade after <em>Source</em>'s release, that upgrade proved popular enough to bear what appears to be its carbon copy in <em>Global Offensive</em>, which happily retains the beauty of the knife kills. So why were all those first-person shooter experiences so popular? It's simple: because they were simple. <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>&mdash;just like <em>Source</em>, then 1.6 before it&mdash;is a simple first-person shooter. There are no perks. No levels. No unlocks. Your weaponry and gear are based on money you spend at the beginning of each round. Money that you accumulate with kills. This design makes <em>CS: GO</em> unlike its first-person shooter competitors. The <em>Call of Duty</em>s and <em>Battlefield</em>s that even the most infrequent of gamers recognize are vastly different from a game like <em>GO</em>. <em>GO</em> puts its players on a fairly equally footing. Your wins are determined by your skills as a shooter, and your ability to identify what weapon you're most proficient with. Not everyone is as handy with the infamous AWP, a one-hit kill sniper known all too well in the <em>Counter-Strike</em> community. Heck, I can sometimes score more kills with a Desert Eagle pistol than I can with my usual preferred M4 rifle. But I'm just weird like that. (Knifing in <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>) It all comes down to how you play. And as you practice&mdash;burning through the classic mode of Counter Terrorist versus Terrorist in a plant-the-bomb, defuse-the-bomb, rescue-the-hostages scenario as well as the newer modes&mdash;you get progressively better. <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> is definitely a <em>competitive</em> first-person shooter. It's a competitive FPS that makes you feel proud of your kill/death ratio, knowing that it all had to do with raw skill. Even little details&mdash;like being able to run faster with a knife equipped rather than your bulkier rifle&mdash;solidify this claim. There's an emphasis on realism&mdash;like the new addition of your scope turning hazy while walking&mdash;but the emphasis on giving every player an equal footing is what really makes the game what it is. That realism continues in one important, controversial way. The knife kill. The Controversy of the Knife Kill Unlike <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> and its predecessors require you to physically equip your knife in order to use it. That one second required to switch over to equip the knife&mdash;either scrolling through on your mouse or hitting the hotkey&mdash;makes a significant difference as opposed to the automatically triggered knives in <em>CoD</em>. It makes the knife kill that much harder to pull off than the other first-person shooters of our world. (Kill streak rampage with the ballistic knife in <em>Black Ops</em>) Another key difference is how many FPS games will send your body lurching toward the enemy with the click of a joystick. It's basically an aim assist. Especially with the addition of the commando perk in <em>MW2</em>, players would become annoyingly deadly with a knife attack. <em>GO</em>, on the other hand, requires you to run or sneak up to your enemy. Requiring the knife killer to actually approach an enemy at normal speed is yet another example of <em>GO</em>'s attempt to make the shooter experience less cheesy. You'll have to use a bit of tact, sneakiness, and finesse to catch someone off guard. It doesn't feel like <em>CoD</em> where you shoot someone to smithereens and yet the panic knifer still gets the upperhand. Before you know it, they've launched into your body with superhuman strength and speed, leaving you virtually flat on your back and cursing in real life. I've seen players wipe an entire team out in <em>Black Ops</em> using the ballistic knife, either skewering enemies from a distance or slashing them in closer range. <em>GO</em>'s knife kills are more celebrated events, whereas in <em>Call of Duty</em> it might just be today's opted slaughtering method. Then there are other issues. Should the knife kill be a one-hit kill from the back, two stabs required of the front? For lurching knife kills: what range should a game allow you to be in relation to your enemy to pull the knifing off? Knifing is an intricate art in first-person shooters, the nature of which is quibbled over by many FPS fans. <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> introduced even more complications with the addition of attached and ranged knives. Now you'll have to contend with knife experts who have a new set of knifey options with varying damage statistics, behaviors, etc. Granted, at least players have to manually equip the knives in that new stock brought on by <em>MW2</em> as opposed to the standard, automatically-equipped knife you start off with in recent <em>CoD</em> games. Though while tactical knives had to be equipped, throwing knives could be aimed. So there's that. (Throwing knife montage in <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>) <em>Counter-Strike</em> has always employed a more tactful, measured approach to knife kills. You can pull off a one-hit kill from the back, and certain sweet spots will do enormous damage, but you can't always dominate a player just because you have a knife in hand and have managed to get within slicing range. Your enemy may just surprise you. A de-emphasis on the one-hit kill makes knifing in <em>GO</em> a much more complex procedure. You'll really have to plan it out appropriately to pull it off. And since we're on the topic of melee kills: what happened to knocking people out with the butt of your gun? <em>Halo</em> encourages a gun-butt tactic to finish off a kill. The game will even allow you to one-hit melee-kill fodder enemies. I can appreciate that methodology. The knife kill in first-person shooters is a point to pick with many gamers. It can be infuriating to dominate the shooting field just to be left sprawled on the ground from a lucky knife hit. People argue that there is no strategy, no skill involved in the lurch-knife (known as the panic knife) move. If you're one such player, you'd be doing yourself a favor to check out <em>GO</em>'s knifing method. For once, you can actually appreciate being killed by a knife, knowing that you have to give your murderer props for managing to land the hit <em>just right</em>.

In order to have srcds_run auto-update when the CS:GO dedicated servers get patched, the srcds_run script must be run with the following options: -autoupdate -steam_dir STEAMDIR -steamcmd_script STEAMSCRIPT where STEAMDIR is the directory to the steamcmd dir ( example: ~/Steam/ ) where STEAMSCRIPT is the name of the script that steamcmd should execute ( example: ~/Steam/csgo.txt ) For information on how to create a script for steamcmd, see https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter- Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers#Automating_SteamCmd ",

        "contents": "Let's all admit that Dust was a fantastic map in <em>Counter-Strike: Source</em>. It was small enough to where the pace was always active, with the proper amount of choke points and alternate routes for optimal strategizing. But part of the charm of <em>Source</em> was discovering the community maps and mods. Valve understands that charm all too well. Which is why they've helped support Plague Fest modders to develop their <a href=\"http://plaguefest.com/threads/zombie-escape-cs-go.11762/\">Zombie Mod</a> for <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. Valve has apparently even <a href=\"http://plaguefest.com/threads/cs-go-blog-braaaiiiins.11756/\">developed the zombie model themselves</a>. The Zombie Mod is kind of hit or miss currently. It's a little buggy, textures are wonky, and some of the maps are confusing. The one server dedicated to this particular mod is also currently capped at 25 players. Fortunately there are plans to extend that to 64 which, once you get into the server, you'll realize how much more appropriate that is for a mod that emphasizes a horde of zombie players as your enemy. But this <em>Mirror's Edge</em> map in particular caught the eye of our video editor, Chris Person. It's not the typical experience of playing rounds of <em>Global Offensive</em>. It's a not the quick rounds of small maps that you're used to. There's even less emphasis on shooting your guns. The <em>Mirror's Edge</em> map is more about parkouring through the large, spacious area. Occasionally you'll be forced into choke points to fend off a large group of zombies. There's something weirdly peaceful about a round of <em>Global Offensive</em> in this mod/map combination, especially thanks to the <em>Mirror's Edge</em> music. It feels like an entirely different experience. Check it out in our video above, courtesy of Chris. ",

But if you haven't touched the beta or purchased the game retail, feel free to get familiar with some of the old school maps and new(ish) school modes right here. This video gives you a glimpse at what the first-person shooting action in <em>CS: GO</em> is like, game skills courtesy of our own Chris Person. It's not unlike Valve's immensely popular <em>Source</em>, full of tightly wound maps and Counter-Terrorist versus Terrorist objectives (plant the bomb, defuse the bomb, save the hostages, kill your opponents as much as you can). The video features a glance at the Bank and Dust maps. We'll have more on the new Arms Race mode, modeled after the Gun Game mod for <em>Counter-Strike: Source</em> that rewards kills with a new weapon later. Oh, and, for Chris's sake: keep in mind this was his first time playing <em>GO</em>. And it's been years since either of us played <em>Source</em>. ",

UI: • Voice notification can now show more players talking. • Updated the freeze panel to no longer show the heath for your killer in competitive mode. • Added an option in the menu to disable the game instructor messages. • Update to the player info panel to no longer show achievement alerts. • Update to the leaderboard screen to default to &#147;Friends&#148; filter. • Added the &#147;Total Games Played&#148; leaderboard category. • Updated the Play With Friends screen: -- Made the chat window bigger so text is no longer cut off. -- Adjusted the size of dimming when the focus changes between friends list and lobby list. It used to obscure the friends list and a little of the chat. Now it only obscures the friends list. Bug Fixes: • Updated the radio command panel so that the radio panel doesn't end up at the top of the screen during a mode that doesn't have a money panel. • Set Classic Casual deadtalk to 0 to encourage fair play. • Fixed the freeze panel dynamic positioning that would allow it to go too high. • Fixed a missing text string displayed when player is not connected to Steam in leaderboards. • Fixed a bug where the Mag7 could be bought by Ts via console commands. • Fixed a bug where adding favorite server was not functional in the Community Server UI. • Fixed a bug in the Play With Friends lobby where using left and right on keyboard or gamepad made the screen unresponsive. • Fixed a bug in the Play With Friends lobby where typing in the Chat window would cause player names to flicker in the friends list. • Fix for voice/chat/radio messages. Better unified the handling of voice and chat messages. -- Chat messages now correctly use sv_allchat (instead of sv_alltalk), which should be more consistent with other source games. -- Team-only communications now are not affected by sv_allchat/sv_alltalk, which means that private communications to one's team stay private, regardless of game mode. -- Team-only communication is also not overridden by sv_full_alltalk, which allows teams to privately communicate strategy during warmup time and intermission. -- Radio commands are considered team-only, so these should still be usable for tactics during games with sv_alltalk enabled (e.g. casual). -- Spectators no longer hear team-only communications, except when sv_spec_hear is mode 2 (hear/see comms of the spectated teams). Audio: • Increased the audible range of the c4 plant and disarm sounds. • Fixed audio randomly chirping/screeching on certain levels. Matchmaking: • Tuned lobby distance computations when performing matchmaking. • Exposed a convar (\"mm_csgo_community_search_players_min\") for community quick match to look for community servers having at least specified number of human players already playing. Community: • Shipped zombie model to support the Zombie Mod ",

Bug Fixes: • Fixed a bug where a dash was displayed when there was no score in the scoreboard. • Fixed an issue with the HUD scaling not working with some elements. • Enabled controller sampling regardless of input lock. • Fixed several vgui fonts being too large at larger resolutions. • Ignore low violence registry settings for CS:GO since we have no low violence regions. • Fixed winning text not getting updated for arms race. • Fixed win panel misalignments. • Updated the scoreboard to fill from top to bottom for the order of players joining. • Updated the scoreboard - moved the nav buttons up when you play with 10 players. Added a more opaque background. Community Support: • Added convars for better server customization: o mp_solid_teammates - Determines whether teammates are solid or not. o mp_free_armor - Determines whether armor and helmet are given automatically. o mp_weapons_allow_zeus - Determines whether the Zeus is purchasable or not. o mp_halftime - Determines whether or not the match has a team-swapping halftime event. • Omitted reference to ranking or matchmaking from button warning.

Bug Fixes: • Fixed an issue in the HUD player count where players who left or changed state quickly were not getting updated in the scoreboard as such. • Updated the Play With Friends screen to enable the private/public toggle. • Boot invites should now be accepted after the game loads from an invite click in steam message. • Fixed description text for the Achievement: &#147;Awardist&#148;. • Fixed server crash caused by taking environment (falling) damage while defusing. • Fix for firing delay after weapon switching during a reload. • Fix for cash awards not be applied properly for grenade kills. Matchmaking: • By default the input device is locked to keyboard and mouse. Community Support: • Fixed a bug where custom server map lists wouldn't populate if CT models weren&#146;t specified. Server now sends information about slots, models, arms and maplist before serverinfo so that correct models could be loaded. • When hashing the community server response we take into account game mode/type/numslots so that we rebuild extended kv when mode changes, but the map remains the same. • Added commandline argument \"-maxplayers_override\" that, if exists, trumps any &#147;maxplayers&#148; values read from gamemodes files. • Added -gamemodes_serverfile command line parameter that allows specifying a file other than the default gamemodes_server.txt • Network stringtables will not be using dictionaries on community servers even if convar is enabled. This allows clients to actually download map since resources are referenced by strings and the client will not have the dictionary until they have the map. • Client will defer .bsp file preload until after required resources are available. For the case of a missing map, this allows the client to reach signon state \"new\" and kick off downloader thread while retaining their spot on the server. This allows community servers to essentially run 3rd party maps that clients will download when played. ",

        "contents": "Gameplay: • Update to bot aiming system. Players should see a substantial decrease in the ability of bots to get perfect shots on moving targets, especially at lower difficulty levels. Bots now can react poorly (or well) to enemies that are dodging/strafing, and also must now account for their own movement while shooting. • Moved the setting of maxplayer from maps to modes in gamemodes.txt. • Increased Casual money rewards, per Beta feedback. • The difficulty of the upper tier bots has been increased. • Updating movement values to community vetted numbers. Thanks Wombo! Weapons: • The max penetration distance has been increased to 7.5 feet. • Increased recoil of the AK-47. • Slightly lowered recoil and increased accuracy of the Famas. • Increased armor penetration and increased damage of the MP7. • Increased damage and increased movement speed of the SSG08. • Decreased accuracy of the Tec-9. • Increased damage of the UMP45. • Fixed the &#147;quick switch exploit&#148; that allowed players to bypass slow weapon cycle times by switching weapons. • Increased the duration of the AWP deploy animation to 1.25 seconds. • Reduced the strength of the flashbang. • Berettas no longer shift horizontally when their accuracy changes. • The SSG08 texture has been updated. • Added rumble effect to knife. • Fixed grenades becoming stuck on players or inside them when thrown from within a player volume. • Changed grenades to bounce more realistically off of players. • Players should no longer be able to boost off of grenades. • Reduced the opacity core radius for player standing inside a smoke grenade. Animations: • Updated the AWP viewmodel firing animation. This was inspired by community feedback that suggested more towards-the-viewer recoil and less vertical recoil. • Added some recoil to the SSG08 rifle viewmodel firing animation. • Updated the 3rd person CT firing pose for SSG08. This fixes major shoulder and elbow popping, minor forearm popping on transition between firing and idle while crouched. • Updated the following viewmodel firing animations: -- Berettas -- AK-47 -- M4A4 -- Desert Eagle -- Galil AR UI: • Added full screen windowed mode to video options. • Removed Quick Match from the Play Menu. • Updates have been made to the Vote UI: -- The vote thumbs and counts now also display on the vote result, so you get a summary of why it passed or failed. -- Now when a vote fails because it was cast recently, we show that warning message before we would show the failure for an individual voter recently casting a failed vote. -- Fixed the result numbers sometimes not showing the very last vote that caused it to succeed or fail. -- The player list is now scrollable when there are more than 10 selectable players. -- Added a new convar - \"sv_arms_race_vote_to_restart_disallowed_after\" that should be set to the weapon level after which no restart match vote will be accepted. This convar is currently set in GameModes.txt for each of the modes of play, and is set so that a vote to restart will work until someone reaches the knife level. • Updated the text for the Loading screen hints. • Updated weapon grind achievement descriptions to match their new values. • Now when you drop a weapon voluntarily, a message pops up letting you know it was dropped. • A message stating you cannot drop an item will now display when you try to drop non-droppable items. • Armor and helmet icons have been updated. • Updated the hit area for menu buttons that prevents the buttons from flickering between up and over states when cursor is near the left edge of the button. • Updates have been made to the Warmup panel: -- The Warmup panel never comes up if it doesn't have a value to fill out the number. -- The Warmup panel now properly clears when the UI clears it, so it knows to come back up again when necessary. • Offline with Bots match set up screen now uses different icons for \"Random\" map groups based on the chosen game mode (Arms Race, Demolition or Classic). • Updated the Options menu to use wider text fields. • Updated the T icon. • Update to the options screen slider control: -- You can now double click the box to select the whole number string. -- You can now put your cursor in the middle of a block of numbers to start editing it in the middle. -- When you are sliding the bar, the number will update as expected. -- Improved the highlight in the Achievements screen. -- Added ability to page through the categories in the Achievements screen using Page Up and Page Down keys. • Scoreboard improvements: -- Updated the Win Banner to be more in line with rest of UI. -- Added highlight for player selecting. -- Added mute icon. -- Added a Team Switch icon. -- Generalized the \"dead\" visual state in the scoreboard so the row is dimmed regardless of whatever other states that player is in (previously it wouldn't dim if for example, you were also dominating that player and they were dead) -- Updated the Vote panel UI to use checkbox/x iconography instead of the thumbs up/down. -- The radar maps were updated for the SE versions of Aztec, Dust 2 and Nuke. -- The Terrorist Buy Zone indicator on the radar image for Dust2 and Dust2 SE has been updated. -- The opening upfront movie art has been updated. -- Added a Join Game Button to the Play With Friends Lobby. -- Increased the font size on Vote result panel. -- Brightened the player outline in the Mini-Scoreboard. -- The Match Set Up screen now hides the arrows in the map navigation panel when the current game mode includes maps or map groups with only one map. -- Fixed issues with the Recently Unlocked Awards. -- The Recently Unlocked Awards panel now uses a time window (currently 5 days) to determine which Achievements to display. -- &#147;Screen Resize&#148; is now labeled as &#147;HUD Resize&#148; in the Advanced Video Settings screen. -- Fullscreen menu screens now have animating background and foreground elements. -- The &#145;Team Full&#146; messages on the Choose Team screen now display longer. -- Spectators will no longer see &#147;Your Team Lost&#148; in the Scoreboard. -- Radio commands are now updated for the new audio commands. -- Overhead alert icon is brighter, a bit more saturated and easier to see. -- Removed \"Play Distance\" option from the menu and replaced it with HUD scaling bar and viewmodel display position default. -- Added a key bind to &#145;Start a Vote&#146;. -- Moved Viewmodel settings to the Game Settings menu. -- Removed delay on death notices. -- Updated colors and bg for readability. -- Increased number of death notices to seven total and made them stick around a tad longer. -- Increased the number of characters before truncating in the death message. -- Player clan name is now shown in the death message and id's panels. -- Updated Achievement chat colors to current scheme. -- Tweaked death message colors again to bring them closer in line with others. • Scoreboard update -- Now accommodates 24 players. -- Scoreboard no longer hides all other UI elements. -- Fixed Z order for a variety of panels which now allows the chat to draw on top of the scoreboard. -- MVP stars are now broken out in the scoreboard. -- Added ping column. -- Added dollar signs to the scoreboard elements that are represented in dollars. -- Fixed other players showing your local clan tag on their target id name. -- The server name now shows in the scoreboard. -- Showing Elo brackets in scoreboard for casual mode. -- Added Cost per Kill column to the scoreboard. • Added Community Quick-Play button to PLAY sub menu. • Made HUD team color adjustments to make them more uniform. • Created an additional function to set team colors for \"additive\" drawing because different HUD elements used the same color values, but rendered them differently. • Fixed the chat panel to more-or-less match the position of the voice/info panel. • Added the Community Server Browser to the Ingame menu under the title \"Browse Community Servers\" • Added a content warning message before displaying Server Browser. • Chat UI update: -- Made the in-game chat window smaller. -- Fixed the scroll bar on the ingame chat. -- Chat input UI now makes a sound when too many characters have been typed. -- Updated the max number of characters to be1024. -- Allow numpad ENTER key to close the chat window. • Added keybindings to &#145;Autobuy&#146; and &#145;Rebuy Previou&#146;s. • Shortened binding label &#147;ESCAPE&#148; to &#147;ESC&#148;. • Added keybinding to buy menu's 'CLOSE'. • Added the &#145;Dust Mission&#146; to the match set up carousel. • The mini scoreboard now supports more than 10 players. • The mini scoreboard now uses the server's num players instead of being hard coded. • Modified scrollable player/map list in \"Call Vote\" panel. • Made scrolling thumbs bigger. • Modified scrollbar buttons to be more like standard buttons. • Update to Choose Team screen: -- Screen can now show up to 24 players. -- Added names to the avatars on the team select screen. • Fixed the radio panel to position correctly under the money panel again, but will never overlap the health panel regardless of screen res or safezone settings. Maps: • A collision model update has been made to props on all maps. • Aztec -- Reduced foliage prop popping. -- Refined area for the bomb zone area graphic indicators on the radar map. -- Added collision at the bombsite to prevent bomb falling into a crack in the geometry. -- Fixed some terrain seams near bomb site B. -- The planking on scaffolding has been moved so it is no longer a navigation hazard.

Thanks, VeryGames. • Bank -- Players can now crouch jump through the drive thru window of the bank building. -- Bullet decals now work on the interior surfaces of the safe. • Inferno -- Fixed a bug where a tree was growing out of a trash pile texture near Logs. -- Fixed a bug where a Bot with the bomb is unable to get out of the fountain at bombsite B. • Italy -- Tuned the Nav mesh. Fixed several jump-over-fence issues and the big issue with bots not navigating down from the hostage balcony. -- Changed Italy wine pallet collision type to cardboard. • Office -- Fixed the harsh lighting glitch in Garage near Back Way. -- Fixed the Bots getting stuck when traveling over counter tops. -- Moved the ashtray back into a corner which should fix an issue with the hostages getting stuck when exiting the building. • Nuke -- Updated the language on the radiation warning signs. Changed 'radioactiv' to 'radioaktiv!' and 'Kein Zutritt' to 'Kein Zutritt!' -- Updated the Forklift prop. • Train -- Fixed some missing ladder Nav areas to help bots climb up on ends of flatcars. -- Added new ladders to sides of bombsite train cars, adjusted biohazard straps to not be in the way of the middle of the cars. The bomb should now be plantable and defusable in the middle of each car. • Shorttrain -- Cleaned up Nav mesh. Deleted orphan areas, fixed bad jumps, fixed stale Nav mesh over missing geometry, and made tops of trains \"avoid\" areas. -- Fixed a bomb placement bug on shorttrain. -- Added ladders to the middle of each side of the flatcars, added ladder markup, and moved struts out of the way. -- Fixed weird geometry that was floating in mid-air on the flatcar model. Audio: • New Voice Overs added for Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist units. • Fixed the looping ambience for Lake. • Players grabbing a hostage, planting a bomb, defusing a bomb, and players close to a bomb that is about to explode now all say something over the radio informing their team of what's happening. • Player now brags over the radio when he's dominating someone. • Players now cheers over the radio when the win scoreboard is up when the match is won by his team. • Fixed a bug in the exponential panning mode. • Added snd_headphone_pan_mode and snd_speaker_pan_mode convars that specify using 0 = exponential, 1 = equal power, 2 = GoldSrc (trigonometric) for both headphone and speaker monitoring situations. This differentiation is important for setting system defaults and we may even consider differentiating surround circumstances as the speaker positioning does. • Split front/rear speaker position options for stereo versus surround. In CS:GO, stereo speaker configurations are going to want the broadest range of positional data, whereas surround systems should default to 45 degree corners, which gives both resolution and sensitivity. Adding these was largely so we can supply the best default settings possible. • Default panning method is now based (again) on an exponential curve but with an adjusted 1.22 exponent. This not only makes for less inter-speaker blurring but was determined to be the flattest xfade response in decibel level testing. Equal power remains as an option. • New convar options have reasonable doc strings. • Added snd_speaker/headphone_pan_radial_weight, which applies the \"GldSrc\" stil cosine weighting but weighted by this float convar. this allows for 1.6 style side weighting but with the exponential center weight allowed by exponential mode. • Removed all dsp from first person weapon sounds. • Added burn damage sound entry start operator to block subsequent damage sound for 1.0 seconds. • Crossfade from \"near\" gunfire to \"distant\" gunfire is now smooth, fixing the bug wherein distant sounds first got quieter then louder the further they were from the listener -- Added exponential function to the \"near\" / \"distant\" crossfade operators. -- \"distant\" weapon fire mix group has been increased significantly to offset the reduction in decibel levels. • Added \"pow\" function to math operator to facilitate non-linear crossfades in operator stacks. • Added a parameter that discounts \"player sound\" status when determining the distance of a sound that is currently hardcoded into the operators system (\"source 1\" legacy).. \"force_not_player_sound\" • Changed all of the new sounds spatialization options to use the following denial test if(sv.IsActive() && !sv_cheats.GetBool()) -- This prevents players from changing their settings during a non-cheat enabled game but allows them to tweak them during a cheat enabled game. • Fixed a bug that was always playing the AK47 sounds from the same location • Famas - lengthened sound to smooth the 3 shot burst • Small edit to the ak47_shoot, rate at beginning of wave lengthened and pitch slightly lowered in this area as well. • Re-authored the footsteps to increase clarity and remove mush, they are also louder and now more distinct within the world. Effects • Fixed a bug with the weapon shell eject effect. The highest-quality level of the effect (which usually accounted for the first three shots fired in a sequence) was using some complicated stuff for the shell bounce that was inadvertently sending the shell flying off in wrong directions at high velocities. The bug was observed on the AUG (rifle shell), but was also present on several other types of shell ejects. • A bunch of hit impact effects have had some of their previous POW restored. • Blood impacts are less randomly angled and more obvious overall now. • Updated tracers speeds. • r_drawtracers_firstperson is now visible and archived and fixed. • Smoke grenade effect now has reduced draw order issues. • Smoke grenade effect no longer has a great disparity between the screen fog effect and the world fog sprites. • Reduced the length of time the particle smoke/dust lasts after an HE grenade explodes. • C4 explosions now have a core explosion that happens right at the bomb itself (so it doesn't look odd when you are spectating or defusing it when it goes off) • Spectators and observers now have a significant reduction in flashbang effect done to them. General Bug Fixes: • Fixed player interrupting another player defusing the bomb by walking in front of them. • Fixed player names running too long in the call vote kick player panel. • Fixed a bug in Arms Race where switching teams put a bot in the Spectator team. • The G3SG1 model now has the safety switch set to 'F'. • The Galil AR model no longer has the light burn on the side plate. • Fixed issue that let the player crouch and slide around with C4. • Fixed the penetration code checking a minimum distance of 2 feet after the first impact for the next impact to happen (this fixes surfaces getting ignored if the first wall penetrated was less than 2 feet think - which is pretty common) -- The material blockbullets_cs now completely blocks bullets regardless of penetration. -- Maximum penetration distance has been reduced from 10.6 feet to 4 feet. • Fixed a bug in Demolition mode where bonus grenade rewards were being called out as achieved but not always given. • Fix for bug where a spectated player with the AUG/SSG zooms in, the spectator sees the muzzle of the weapon. • Fix for z-fighting on Phoenix arms at the wrist on the left side that occurs when carrying the knife and looking directly upwards. • Fixed the radio \"!\" showing up above your own head when you issued a radio command - still shows over other players/bots heads. -- Adjusted color of the overhead \"!\" radio icon to match the HUD scheme. • Restricting 'The Cleaner' and 'Ballistic' achievements to classic mode. Updated description strings to reflect that. • Restricting 'Friendly Firearms' achievement to classic modes. • Restricting 'Base Scamper' to Arms Race mode. • Fixed incorrect Arms Race achievement descriptions. • Fixed a message displaying that you can't plant bomb if you had the C4 selected and used anything (door, etc). • Fixed the C4 button press beeps continuing to play if you started arming the bomb and got killed. • Fixed the bad max value for zoom sensitivity in the options screen. • Removed the custom bind for the Zeus in the options screen. Moved knife/Zeus bind down with the rest of the specific item binds. • Warmup mode will no longer happen in an offline match now. • The game won&#146;t ignore spectators when deciding to end the Warmup round. • Fixed the Demolition gun progression panel not showing up if you were controlling a bot at the end of the round. Also fixed the progress displaying incorrectly. • Clicking on the slider bars in the options screens will now change the slider value as expected. • Fixed a button/popup conflict occurring upon selecting \"Restore Defaults\" option. • Fixed the audio reset option not persisting. • Fixed a bug where exiting the video settings screen applies your changes even if you click \"no\". • Fixed a bug where mouse dragging on an option menu slide control resulted in the control being highlighted but not responding to left and right keyboard commands. • Fixed a bug where it was impossible to apply settings changes in options menus using controller. • Fix for first person view weapon not showing up when spectating in Arms Race. • Fix for Safehouse and Shorttrain Map Veteran Medals not working. • Fixed revenge count achievement not progressing in Demolition mode. • Fixed a case where the Arms Race message, \"Alert - You are the new leader\" was displaying in Demolition mode. • Fix for the Friendly Firearms Achievement being unattainable. It could not be unlocked if the weapon was not purchased that round. Now the game tracks the prior team ownership when a weapon is dropped. This enables the game to know if a weapon was ever owned by a given team. This value is now used to determine if and when a kill is made with a weapon that once belonged to the killed player's team. • Fix for friendly fire messages not including the (BOT) prefix. • Arms Race now shows the correct next weapon when you start a new game. • Fixed case where if your vote failed previously, you wouldn&#146;t get the vote button strings on the next vote cast by another player. • Fixed potential bug where some players wouldn't get a voting dialog panel when others cast a vote. • Fixed the Taser range to target indicator where the reticule changing from Green to Red didn&#146;t match the actual range of the Taser. • Fixed losing mouse focus when in the Achievements menu while a map change occurs. • Fixed the Radar line of sight being unaffected by doors. • Fixed the player being unable to see the radar icon for the bomb they dropped if they took over a bot. • When scrambling teams during Demolition Mode gameplay, we now reset the game data when the round restarts. • Fixed third person weapons not animating. • A fix was made to ensure the Takeover Bot navigation hint is not displayed on the spectator menu inappropriately. It was shown when you changed teams mid round, even though you couldn't actually take over the bot. • Fixed a performance issue caused by changelevel being invoked twice after a change level vote. • Fixed a crash that would allow a server operator to crash clients with bad vote commands. • Fix for the vote UI not sorting to the background when the user opens the buy menu. • Fix for the Call Vote popup disabling the Left and Right arrow keys. • Fix for the Voting UI putting mouse focus back to the game while team select screen is open. • Fix for not being able to vote while the achievements screen is up. • Fix for a scenario where stepping into molotov fire sometimes turns the screen black. Reduced opacity of screen-space smoke effect at the molotov's core from 1.0 to 0.75. -- Also removed some extraneous tings from the molotov explosion and reduced the lifetime on the molotov inferno's embers, which were artificially enlarging the effect's bounding box. • Fix for bound key picking the wrong grenade. • Dropped weapons fly slightly more upwards when thrown from a dead player • Fix for some MVP issues. The game still disallows controlled bots being the MVP, but players are allowed to be chosen MVP. This fix displays the player name correctly as well as allowing players to be selected even if they've taken over a bot. -- This also fixes Top Kills being broken when you take over a bot. • Hostages break glass that they touch now. This fixes hostages in cs_office getting stuck trying to run through the big panes of glass sometimes. • Tightened tolerance for CSBots to defuse the bomb. Fixes edge cases where bots think they are close enough to defuse, but are not so they stand there like zombies. • Fixed the ragdoll force being too high. • Fixed the Buy Menu inventory not being populated or correct when you first open the buy menu. • Fixed the preview panel in the Buy Menu not showing preview data (can buy, owned, etc) • Disallowing five achievements in Arms Race because they did not make sense or were too easy to unlock for that game mode. • Fixed a bug where your inventory display wouldn't get updated properly in some cases when you took over a bot. • Fixed a bug where a bot was issuing the wrong radio commands after the new radio code implementation. • The game will no longer show a \"Game Commencing\" message when the game starts. • Fixed a bug where last known nav area could stay permanently NULL due to a bad traceline on displacement terrain. We now trace from the player's WorldSpaceCenter() downwards instead of their GetAbsOrigin() (their feet). • Fixed bug with CNavMesh::GetNavArea() that would return NULL if a nav area was below the ground at all. It now allows for StepHeight (18 unit) tolerance below ground. This was causing CSBots to sometimes go \"zombie\" and stop moving, particularly at spawn at round restart. • The game no longer shows \"Rounds Left\" in the scoreboard when playing Arms Race. • Fixed the game mode label having a \" - \" in the Scoreboard. • Fix for bug in de_train where shooting while strafing + crouching on the green dumpster prop causes unintended behavior. • Fix for errors and warnings console spew in de_inferno. • Fix a race condition in the main menu animation if you enter a submenu and immediately cancel out of it while the main menu is still closing • Fixed case where the earned Achievements in the Win Panel wouldn&#146;t clear their images so if you earned multiple Achievements in one round and only one in the next, the ones you earned in the last round would still show on the panel. • Fixed a memory overrun when a second controller was connected. • Fixed 'One Shot One Kill' awarding based on second bullet kills. • Changed 'Medalist' to award after 100 medals instead of requiring 100% completion. • Fix for a bug where pulling the network cable on your PC while ingame eventually triggers Steam signout, taking you back to the main menu. • Fixed issue where we were displaying the raw map name before transitioning to it when the match ended. This was also fixed in the vote panel. • Fixed HE Grenade/ molotov not recording kill stats. • Fixed linux DS crash - for pc, we show the raw map name in the chat when we announce the next map just like we used to because we can't assume we know that map name has a localized token. • Fixed logic bug that would not correctly cancel-out splashes when the player was running. • Fix for duplicate game instructor messages displaying when rescuing the hostages. • Fix for target ID over a player displaying default \"target area\" text. • Fixed the thin lines showing on the target IDs before the first time they were filled in. • Changed &#147;War Bonds&#148; Achievement to $50,000 earned. • Fix for bug where user is spectating through the POV of a recently disconnected/quit player, they will be able to see out of world once their character despawns. • Fix for a bug where opening the Scoreboard while in the Choose Team screen shows a camera view of the map floor. • Update to Awards screen to fix confusing flashing awards. • Fixed vote success panels showing bad result data if a vote was cast for the other team only. • Fixed slow orbiting camera movement when using a controller in 3rd person spectator camera view. • Fixed a performance taxing bug where some icons were getting destroyed and recreated each frame if you were a terrorist on a hostage map. • Fix for auto-disconnect message in the HUD going away permanently when the game is paused. • Fix for player being unable to hear knife deployment sounds when deploying the knife while standing on certain properties. • Fix for deploy sound for knife not playing when secondary weapon is dropped. • Fixed a bug where a player would connect late to a dedicated server when the warmup period was already in progress but wouldn't see the warmup panel at the top of the screen. • Fix for voting failing with 6/10 simple majority. • Fix for the Current World Ranking leaderboard mouse over region for individual rows being too large. This caused the incorrect row to be selected while clicking or moving the mouse around the screen. • Fixed bots exclaiming at the start of a round whatever state they were last experiencing when they died or at the end of the previous round. • Fixed a bug where the player was able to switch teams over and over and take control of bots in a game session on a dedicated server. • Fix for a bug where a hostage appeared illuminated on the radar after it was killed. • Fix for incorrect game settings description displayed in loading screen when connecting to a map. • Fix for bug where bot takeover in the middle of a grenade throw results in an extra grenade. • Fixed two edge-case crashes for bot takeover when the bot has no weapons. • Fix for bug where throwing grenades on certain slopes will result in them slowly skittering down the slope rather than coming to rest and exploding. • Fix for a bug that made it possible to throw smoke grenades in such a way that teammates can enter the smoke radius without seeing or hearing the smoke, completely immune to its effect. • Fixed the brightness value slider showing values from highest to lowest. • Fixed SECOND and SECONDS in the \"match is restarting\" alert being hard-coded and not localized. • Reworded the description of \"First Things First\" and \"Target Secured\" Achievements to match what the code expects you to do to achieve it as they were perceived as unawardable. • Fix for scenario in Demolition mode where after killing an opponent the bonus grenade pop up or next gun pop up will block the user's reticle hindering aiming. • Fixed bomb planted instructor hints showing up for a frame and then going away most of the time. • Removed account balance requirement from the &#147;Killanthropist&#148; Achievement criteria. • Fixed new modulated decal art not having enough contrast to make it work with the modulation shader and made a bunch of decals really hard to see. • Fixed cl_spec_mode not saving the player preference so it always reset you to the default spec option. • First person spectator is now the default for all modes. • Fixed throwing weapons landing too short or too high. • Fixed case where if the viewmodel gun barrel traced through a solid object on its way to the impact point, the tracer would interpenetrate that object and make shooting feel off or fake. • Fixed dlight muzzle flash being in the wrong spot (the attachment points on viewmodel never return the proper world position). • Fixed the Scoreboard delay that prevented fast toggling. • Fixed the Scoreboard getting stuck in a toggle state if you weren&#146;t alive. • Fixed th...",

        "contents": "Gameplay • Bot difficulty has been adjusted. They should be a bit easier now. Dedicated Servers: • Added support for overriding values in gamemodes.txt via gamemodes_server.txt - See csgo/gamemodes_server.txt.example for instructions on how to modify it and define your own map groups. • Added support for map sidecar files, which allow mappers to distribute map-specific gamemodes.txt variables in a separate file. - See csgo/maps/de_dust_se.kv as an example. • Fixed mp_timelimit not working properly when mp_maxrounds was set to 0. UI • net_graph has several changes that will allow players to better see values they (or the server operator) have configured incorrectly. - The most important difference is that the game tick rate is now shown in the bottom left, which is where &#147;sv:&#148; (server fps) used to be. Server fps is not really a useful metric for players except when it is below the tick rate (indicating the server is overloaded). Server FPS above the tick rate is meaningless. - The cl_updaterate and cl_cmdrate rate are now labeled as &#147;up:&#148; and &#147;cmd:&#148;, respectively. There is now color coding added to some of the values to indicate out of band values. If cmdrate or updaterate are set above the tick rate (requires a server operator to override the sv_maxcmdrate and sv_maxupdaterate), these values are shown in red. For optimal play experience, these values should match the server tick rate, which is the default behavior unless a server operator has overridden convars. - Fixed formatting so that the right aligned values are correctly aligned and text doesn&#146;t shift and jump as displayed values change. • A banner element has been added to the Match Scoreboard to better convey Win, Lose, and Draw match results. • Hint text has been added to the bottom of the Loading screen. • Updated the Armor icon next to the Armor meter to include the Helmet when purchased. • Updated the dominated/dominating/revenge icons for freeze panel, mini-scoreboard, and death notices. • Updates to the Arms Race UI: - Now when someone reaches the Gold Knife level, the HUD shows a message in the chat text, displays an alert, and plays a sound effect. - The scoreboard now displays the winner of the Arms Race match. - The Arms Race weapon progression HUD element in the lower right now properly displays the data for the person you are spectating. • In Casual and Competitive modes, the weapon inventory in the lower right of the HUD displays the spectated player&#146;s information now. • Voting UI updates: - Fixed the panel going away right after you cast a vote or saw a vote be cast as a client. - The vote panel has been made smaller and positioned so it doesn't cover other UI elements. - After you cast a vote, the game no longer shows the text instructing you to press F1/F2 to vote. - The Vote to Surrender option has been removed. Voting to Restart serves the same purpose. - When an attempt to vote fails because it had already failed recently, the error message is now more descriptive about what's going on. - If a player casts a vote when another vote is already in progress, they get a message letting them know. - If there are no players or maps that can be voted on when you try to cast a vote, those categories are disabled in the UI. - The vote panel now animates. - Added the proper sounds to the voting events. - A fix was made to a vote you cast in a single player game automatically failing. - Fixed the map you are currently playing displaying in the vote UI as \"undefined\". - Updated the size, look and translucency of the vote panel. - Added the ability to change the next map in the map list which overrides the next map in the mapgroup. - Changed the text, \"Restart the map?\" to \"Restart the match?\" - Voting for the same map you are playing as the next map will extend it and just restart the map instead of loading. - Fixed voting panel displaying during the freeze cam screenshot. - Fixed votes for a certain category failing if they had failed previously but had a different subcategory (for example, a vote failed for kicking player A wouldn't let anyone vote to kick player B) • Added a slider to the options menus that allow user to see and edit the numeric value directly. • Removed the Random mapgroup choice from multiplayer Find a Game screen. • Various improvements have been made to the loading screen to improve the layout. • Changed the default bot difficulty option in the Offline with Bots screen to be \"Easy\" instead of \"No Bots\". Maps • Shoots - Fixed some vphysics console error spew by turning off collision on static props that don't have or don't need collision. • Baggage - Moved some fill lights out a bit from the wall to reduce highlight intensity. - Fixed some prop fading glitches. • Dust - Adjusted the Buy Zone edges to make sure all of the spawn points are completely inside the zones now. - Set static props with no physics hull to non-solid. • Dust 2 - Added clip brush to a crate at B that fixes an issue with the player getting stuck and dying. - Fixed the misaligned Humvee windows near CT spawn. • Inferno - Adjusted the Buy Zone edges to make sure all of the spawn points are completely inside the zones now. - Fixed some red console spew with static props without physics. • Train - Fixed a spawn point at T spawn that was intersecting a pillar. • Lake - Fixed a number of lighting issues. • Office - Fixed an error message regarding the slide show projection. • Safehouse - Fixed hard to see into entry way from back porch on the T side. - The bush prop is now placed against the wall on the T side of the house. - Fixed a hole that went through to the skybox creating a bright blue spot under the CT side porch next to the stairs. • St Marc - Removed certain phys props. - Fixed a number of bad fade distances for cover props. - Turned some phys props to static props. - Fixed some bad fades on overlays. - Fixed z-fighting in fence. • Nuke - Moved the forklift and added clip brushes to prevent collision issues. - Added clips to the blue beams in lobby room. • Sugarcane - Turned a number of phys props to static. - Deleted certain phys props. - Fixed a few bad fade distances. Audio • Fix for the ding sound not playing consistently when a new weapon is earned in Arms Race. • Updated the bomb planting sounds. • Updated the helmet hit sounds. • Adjusted hostage pain reaction voice overs.

At VERY_LOW/LOW quality levels only vertexlit and phong where actually using the closest cascade (for better character self shadowing), so world shadow quality is mostly unaffected by this change. - Also adding a bunch of CSM culling statistics (displayed at the bottom of the screen when cl_csm_debug_2d is 1). - dust2 timedemo avg. FPS results on a NV 6800/Core2 2.4 GHz at VERY_LOW improved by 13% (higher quality settings also see an improvement). ",

This update offers Arsenal Demolition, Arms Race, and Classic Competitive game modes. The map cycle groups include: - All Classic Maps - Arms Race Maps - Demolition Maps • De_nuke - Fixed bot nav behavior outside locker room and near bombsite A. • Cs_office - Fixed hostage bots getting stuck behind the couch. - Fixed bots getting stuck on the roof of the dumpster. • Cs_italy - Fixed vines penetrating door frame at T Start. - Fixed building floating in skybox at Balcony. - Fixed missing geometry in arches and wall in Market. - Fixed curved pipe and square wall edge creating black area at Left Alley. - Fixed a gap in the floor at Left Alley. - Fixed texture mismatch at Market. - Fixed unnecessary collision on curb at CT Spawn Zone. - Fixed being able to see out of the playable map at Market. - Fixed not being able to jump while standing on potted plant at CT Start. - Fixed small gap in street at Left Alley. - Fixed brightly lit area at window near hostage room and T Start. Gameplay: • Added additional camera punch effect to weapon firing to give more visual feedback. • Added convar to support buying two flashbangs (ammo_grenade_limit_flashbang). This is disabled by default. • SMGs get a range increase. • Falloff distances for SMGs have been improved to reduce micro hits at medium distances. • UMP 45 gets a small armor ratio buff and a very minor cycle time buff. • P90 gets a armor ratio debuff to bring it more in line with its smg brethren rather than make it as good if not better than entry level rifles. • Added first shot recoil suppression to allow for closer grouping of the first few shots in a burst or full auto fire. • TBots that try to plant in an invalid space will quickly give up and pick a new place to try to plant now. • Arms Race now ends with a gold knife to convey to the user the difference between killing someone with a knife to steal their level and killing someone with a knife to win the game. • A knife kill in Arms Race now only sets you back a weapon level if you were killed by an enemy. • The C4 now has a short (0.5 second) grace period for defusing, during which time the player can interrupt and resume defusing. This restores the old 0.5 second latency that existing in CS for defusing, but also maintains the newer preferred ability to stop defusing without the player being inexplicably stuck for up to 0.5 seconds. This also greatly reduces the chance that small lag/packet loss events will result in the defuse being interrupted. • Reduced the size of the hostage hitboxes. • Changed the ducking speed to match the unducking speed. Both are now 200 ms. • Slightly reduced HE grenade damage per pro feedback. • Reduced per shot weapon inaccuracy across all weapons.

Instead, the user must hit the Apply button for the vsync setting to be changed, like most of the other settings. • Video settings - the \"Reset to Defaults\" disables vsync now. • Added missing motion blur option to the Advanced Video Settings menu. The Advanced Video options have been reorganized: global shadow quality is now at the top, and the two anti-aliasing settings have been moved together. • The team select screen now has a short objectives blurb so as a new player you know what the map objectives are. • Updated color of bomb holder, bomb planted and defuse kit icons to match gold, red and blue used elsewhere in the hud. • Updated defuse kit image for buy menu. • Updated several weapon icons. • Updated death notification icons. • Added a T knife icon. • Updated mapgroup thumbnails. • Added new achievement icons. • Updated the radio command panel. • Updated radar minimaps: - Office - Aztec - Lake - Dust - Dust 2 - St Marc - Nuke Audio • Fixed bug that was stopping hostage music abruptly. • Moved kill music stingers from client to server, are more audible, and have been added to demolition mode. • Dominating music stinger now plays for \"still dominating\" as well. • Added &#145;hostages near to rescue&#146; music cues. • Fixed weapon foley being heard at unrealistic distances (player distance misrepresented) • Updated weapon shots: - ak47 - deagle - famas - g3sg1 - m249 - m4a1 - mag7 - mp7 - negev - nova - vscar20 - sg556 - ump45 - awp - ssg08 - sawed off - xm1014 - nova Effects: • Disabled blob shadows. Bug Fixes • Fixed a bug where tracers were not originating from the barrel on machine guns. • Fixed ragdoll bodies twitching postmortem. • Fixed getting stuck in another player when joining spectator team at halftime in competitive mode. • Fixed missing reload animations and recoil for certain picked up weapons. • Fixed scenario where &#147;Counter-terrorists Win\" voice over announcement does not play at round end if the \"bomb has been defused\" voice over is played. • Fixed callvote UI taking mouse focus and breaking the Buy Menu. • Fixed so Tased player models don't bleed out. • Fixed \"Input Device not found\" on PC direct connect games. It now uses platform defaults in the case where an input device is not set before determining bot difficulty. • Removed servers calling votes at the end of a match. • Elo improvements - fixed a bug initializing Elo for users who got initialized by direct connect instead of via matchmaking. • Fixed Terrorists receiving defuse kits. • Fixed an issue where damaged was being sent across the network as a byte. This allowed the AWP and bomb explosions to both result in > 255 damage. • Fixed bug where a game announced &#145;match point&#146; and ended match prematurely. ",
