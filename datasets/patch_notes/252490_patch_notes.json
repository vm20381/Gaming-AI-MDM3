This is an electrical masterpiece and a must-see. He did a pretty amazing puzzle base for the Charitable Rust event last fall which is also worth the watch! SPLENDID FURSTAID PET RESCUE FUNDRAISER Recently Los Angeles, California experienced a terrible wildfire disaster. Resulted in many displaced families and lost pets. ChrissyTinaFx, Raynbirds, and Valair got their heads together and hosted a pet rescue fundraiser to help local animal shelters aid and foster displaced pets. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1811b1/gallery.jpg They also teamed up with the Art of Rust community to paint people's pets in game! https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1811b1/Vix1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1811b1/nshade1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1811b1/monstera1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1811b1/joji.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1811b1/davinci.png So many amazing artists that participated in this event! Many of which you can find on X here. Oh, and Nightshade gave us a speedpaint! Overall they were able to raise over $9,000 for BestFriends.org. Well done everyone! HOW 2 ZERG If you're into highly educational tutorials dripping with dark humor and sarcasm then you're going to love Dirty Trout! He normally edits for other creators but recently came out with his own banger. We're digging this out-of-norm video style and hope to see more! GLOBAL WARFARE 2 TEASER Last summer FancyOrb put together and hosted the Global Warfare 2 event. Where the map was the real world and Rust players from all walks of life competed for territory standing. There were politics, betrayals, victories, and an amazing timeline. He's almost finished with the literal movie about the whole thing and offered up a teaser. Full-length coming soon! Global Warfare 3 when? >>>FULL BLOG HERE ",

        "contents": "PRIMITIVE GAMEMODE The early game of Rust can be the most exciting, unfortunately players rush to fully automatic rifles as fast as possible to get an edge over their enemies. What if the early game could last forever....? The primitive mode brings us to a distant future where the knowledge of high tech items have been lost, leaving the inhabitants of the island only able to make basic items. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250128/rust_primupdate_teaser_armourset_01.jpg The following changes apply to the primitive game mode. Allowed Weapons Melee Bow, Compound Bow, Crossbow, Mini Crossbow Speargun Eoka Beancan Grenade, Molotov Flashlight Attachment Shields Restricted Armor Removed Facemask Removed Metal Chest Plate Resources Changes Less Sulfur Nodes Spawn (50%) Increased Tech Tree Tax (2x) Loot Changes Jackhammer & Chainsaw (loot only) New travelling vendor trades Raiding Changes Removed All Rockets & C4 Removed MLRS Building Changes Removed Metal Building Grade Removed Armored Building Grade Removed Armored Doors Removed C4, Rockets & Explosive ammo World Modifications Removed Monuments (Oil Rig, Missile Silo, Excavator, Underwater Labs) Removed Underground Train System Removed Scientist NPCs (vendors remain) Disabled Patrol Heli Event Disabled Cargo Ship Event Disabled Bradley APC Increased Wild Horse Spawns (2x) Travel Changes Removed Helicopters (Minicopter, Scrap Transport Helicopter, Attack Helicopter) SIEGE WEAPONS Introducing 4 new vehicles: the siege weapons! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250206/medieval_siegeweapons_lineup_01.jpg Designed for early game raiding, they're all craftable and deployable in the wilds. A great addition to your raiding and grubbing arsenal. In addition to the cost to craft, building them will require extra materials and a hammer https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250206/catapult_build_thumb.jpg They are both available in the primitive and vanilla game modes, from the workbench level 2. CATAPULT The catapult is capable of launching powerful projectiles with a large impact radius. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250203/medieval_catapult_02.jpg It comes with 3 new ammunition items: Scattershot: multiple rocks in a spread Firebomb: ignites on impact, spreading flames Propane Explosive Bomb: high-damage explosives, damages construction It can also launch players. Use at your own risk. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250206/catapult_ragdoll_thumb.jpg CATAPULT AMMO You can also use the Firebomb and Propane bombs as a deployable raiding tool. Once deployed they will start to spark when they take any damage and explode after several seconds. When used in this way bombs will do less damage. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/medieval_catapult_ammo_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250207/deployable_ammo_thumb.jpg SIEGE TOWER The Siege Tower provides a new way to get into compounds, high open windows or help with a raid. As the heaviest Siege Weapon, these towers lack some mobility, but make up for it in strength. Like the other Siege Weapons: The Siege Tower can be towed by a horse, or pushed to get it into position. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/medieval_siegeTower_07.jpg Each tower is 3 levels tall, with a drawbridge on each level. Use the drawbridge to provide some protection as you assault a base. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/medieval_siegeTower_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/medieval_siegeTower_02.jpg Each tower can have a door placed at the bottom for an added layer of security. BATTERING RAM The battering ram is a heavy fuel-powered vehicle you can drive around. Its reinforced arm can be used to destroy wooden and stone constructions https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/medieval_batteringram_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/medieval_batteringram_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/medieval_batteringram_02.jpg The ram takes damage with each hit and will need high-quality metal to stay operational. BALLISTA The ballista is a massive, wheeled crossbow designed for long-range combat. It can be deployed on terrain and towed by horses. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/medieval_ballista_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/medieval_ballista_02.jpg It can fire 4 new bolt items: Pitchfork Bolt: large sweeping projectile Piercer Bolt: penetrates armored vehicles Hammerhead Bolt: heavy and solid, deals damage to doors Incendiary Bolt: ignites on impact, spreading flames https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/medieval_ballista_ammo_01.jpg A stationary version is also available, which can be deployed within your base for defensive use. SHIELDS Shields are a new backpack slot item that allows you handle frontal threats with ease. Simply equip the shield in your backpack slot and equip a compatible single handed weapon and the shield will automatically appear. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250203/rust_shields_01.jpg While holding a shield it takes over the function of RMB, so you won’t be able to aim down sights or throw weapons. Instead holding RMB will raise the shield in front of you, giving you more protection at the cost of reduced visibility and not being able to sprint. You can only hold a Shield up for 4 seconds before having to put it back down, this is shown via a small progress bar near the crosshair (similar to the Compound Bow). https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250128/rust_primupdate_teaser_swordight_01.jpg There are 3 shield variants, each with a different damage block amount. This amount is the percentage of damage that the shield absorbs from any incoming attack, the remaining portion will be received by the player holding the shield. While equipped you’ll see a new shield durability bar appear above your health bar, any damage a shield takes is applied to its durability and once broken the shield will be unequipped. Items that are compatible with shields will mention this on their item information panel when selected. When not in use Shields will appear on your back, note that while they are on your back they provide no protection. You will need to equip the shield in order to block any attacks. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250203/rust_shields_03.jpg 4 SHOT MINI CROSSBOW In the spirit of a primitive mode, we wanted to add another arrow weapon. The Mini Crossbow is a fresh take on the Crossbow. Providing 4 shots in a rotating barrel, at the cost of some damage and range. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250203/rust_minicrossbow_hero_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250203/rust_minicrossbow_firstperson_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250203/rust_minicrossbow_tabletop_01.jpg The Mini Crossbow will not only be a great addition to the base game, but also the new primitive gamemode. HORSES Horses have been completely overhauled and should feel much better to play with. They can now traverse most terrain types and monuments New movement mechanics allow them to skid by pressing CTRL when galloping They can swim, auto-avoid trees and be pulled when led https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/rust_horseriding_01.jpg Horses can also tow siege weapons, including the catapult, siege tower, and ballista. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250204/rust_horsetowing.jpg Additionally, their impact on server performance has been massively improved. MEDIEVAL PACK DLC This month, we’re introducing the new Medieval Pack DLC - a themed collection featuring 8 new items and skins consisting of the new Medieval Barricade, Knights Armour clothing skins, Medieval Large Wood Box skin, the Medieval Assault Rifle skin and Medieval skins for the Sheet Metal Door and Double Doors. The pack can be purchased from the Rust Steam item store. Knight Armour Set Arise a brave Knight with these chivalric skins for the Coffeecan Helmet, Roadsign Jacket and Roadsign Kilt. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250128/knightarmour_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_knightArmour_tableTop_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_knightArmourPose_02.jpg Medieval Barricade Lay down this barricade to stave off the most ardent attackers, or augment the battlefield with its unique middle-age-themed visuals. Note that you will need to know the Barbed Wooden Barricade blueprint to craft this. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_barricade_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_barricade_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_barricade_04.jpg Medieval Assault Rifle Kingmaker or Kingslayer - you call the shots with this resplendent relic. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_AR_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_AR_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250130/medieval_AR_08.jpg Medieval Large Wooden Box Every Lord needs a sturdy coffer to store their spoils of war. Look no further than this stalwart companion. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/medieval_largeBox_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/medieval_largeBox_04.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/medieval_largeBox_02.jpg Medieval Sheet Metal Door & Double Door Survey your lands from behind these imposing castle doors, uniquely adorned with spikes to keep the p̶e̶a̶s̶a̶n̶t̶s nakeds out. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250128/rust_medieval_metaldoor_skins_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250128/rust_medieval_metaldoor_skins_06.jpg The pack can be purchased from the Rust Steam item store. RAGDOLLS Temporary player ragdolling has been added for bikes and horses. Taking large amounts of collision damage on bikes and horses will result in the player being flung from their seat and eventually getting back up (assuming they haven't died in the process). Players can also be flung from the saddle of a horse if it's had too much airtime or has slid too far. Horses will ragdoll in these cases as well. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250205/rust_horse_radgoll.jpg If you're unlucky enough to be used as ammunition for a catapult, you'll also ragdoll and are guaranteed to die on impact. Collision damage on bikes has been re-balanced with ragdolls in mind, with the aim of making it less likely to instantly die from hitting obstacles on a bike. FIRST PERSON ADMIN ESP We've been slowly building up the feature set of our admin ESP system over the years, mostly due to the demands of various streaming events. This was restricted to using the debug/flying camera, it will now work as expected while in first person perspective spectating. Many server admins have asked for this to have better situational awareness while spectating players. It uses the same convars as the normal ESP system so you shouldn't need to do anything new. All of the existing convars will apply, this includes: ESPCanvas.MaxNameplates ESPCanvas.OverrideMaxDisplayDistance ESPCanvas.DisableOcclusionChecks ESPCanvas.ShowHealth ESPCanvas.ColourCodeTeams ESPCanvas.UseRandomTeamColours ESPCanvas.DisplayDistanceMultiplier If there are further improvements that would help in live spectating, please let us know! QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Pickup sleeping bags Players can now pick up any sleeping bag as long they are in TC range IO Reskinning Can now reskin IO deployables with the spray can without disconnecting it entirely Phone names Phones can now have names up to 30 characters long Pumpkin Rolling Dropped pumpkins no longer roll indefinitely Backpacks on Weapon Racks Backpacks and shields can now be used with weapon racks. SOCIAL INTEGRATIONS We're rolling out a social integration layer to Rust this month, no more messing around with overlays or alt-tabbing - you can now view, chat, invite, and add friends, all from right inside the game. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/106/02/2025/6T08/Rust_social_integrations_menu_1080_jpg%20%282%29.jpg Your Steam friends list will automatically sync up in-game. No setup required. Prefer using Discord? No problem! All you need to do is link your account, and your Discord friends will be right there, ready to connect. This way, you’ve got the best of both worlds. Give it a try, and as always, let us know what you think. TWITCH DROPS - HOME BREWED 2 Twitch Drops are back! And from more of our favourite creators on the rise that you should definitely start to recognize! Be sure to sync up at to claim your Drops after watching these fantastic creators on Twitch. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b0511b1/td_38-blog-image.jpg SERVER PROFILER - LINUX & REDUCED OVERHEAD TL;DR - Shipping Linux binary; Server profiler should have less impact when idle and recording by gathering less data; if it fails to generate a snapshot, you can now export a debug binary snapshot and share it with us. Linux Support This update will contain a library built for Linux environment. The library is a native recorder, so the interface (the \"perfsnapshot\" command) works the same. The library has been built on Ubuntu 24.04.1 via GCC 13.3 in C++20 mode and it depends on POSIX utilities (dlopen, dlsym) - so it should be accessible everywhere. Profiler Overhead Since the first release of our internal profiler, we got the opportunity to test it in the real world conditions. My first tests were rough (could only capture 1-2 frames worth of data before ballooning to multiple gigabytes of data) and I got feedback from number of server owners that not only it doesn't produce snapshots in some situations, it also has idle overhead - just enabling profiler can have a 5-10fps on a high-pop server. I've spent some time this update cycle to to reduce this overhead, as in the current conditions it severely reduces the benefit we can get out of the tool. I've tackled it from a couple angles: Reduced how much Code we capture The profiler works by annotating every code method that it encounters, wrapping it in a set of calls that dispatch to different Mono profilers. Comparatively, for complex and expensive methods these call are unnoticeable, but for small utility functions that do a trivial thing (change a bool, set a bit, append to a list, etc) the dispatching calls add massive overhead (we're talking 10x+ the cost of the utility function). Lastly, these dispatching calls are cheaper when the profiler is enabled, but not capturing - but they are still not free. Originally I set up a number of annotation filters to exclude some known and safe code (stuff from System.Collections.Generic namespace, for example), but it still left a lot of \"fat\" that we could trim. Here's the before and after of the changes affecting our player processing loop: https://files.facepunch.com/danielprihodko/1b0311b1/msedge_em8WKclH6P.png https://files.facepunch.com/danielprihodko/1b0311b1/msedge_LKtgyfNuqq.png As you can see there's much less of nested calls(reduced verticality), and instant calls (triangles, they take less than Perfetto is able to track) appear much earlier. This update we no longer capture: Hash functions Casting & comparison operators Property getters UnityEngine.CoreModule related code Enumerators Anything Math related Our internal collections (like BufferList) Serialization code There's more, but hopefully you see the principle behind the choice - anything small, trivial or reliable gets ignored. This allowed us to massively reduce the amount of data we generate during capture - on staging server, we used to generate about 17MB of json per player, after these changes it's gone down to ~0.5MB of json per player. This should also reduce the \"idle\" overhead, since there's much less \"dispatch code\" that's scattered around. Improved json generation logic One of the quirks that we have to deal with profiler-gathered data is that it doesn't know where the frame begins and ends - it's just a stream of \"method enter/exit\" records + \"frame end\" record that happens somewhere deep in the managed callstack. And since we want to display the data in a per-frame organized matter, we need to scan this stream to figure out how to partition all records. Originally I implemented a less-efficient version of this because I assumed that there wouldn't be too much data to overwhlem this process. Since the previous section showed that I was wrong on the scale of data, I've also spent a bit of time to improve the export process - we now only need 2 whole-data-set scans to figure out frame grouping, instead of 3 originally, so using napkin-math, this gives us 33% export speedup. Additionally, I've received reports that profiler can fail to generate snapshots. There are a couple scenarios in the above frame-reconstruction logic that can cause it to fail, so for these cases I've added the option to dump a binary debug snapshot - just run \"perfsnapshot 1\", and you should see a \" .bin.gz\" in \" /server/ /profiler/\" folder. I'll be able to inspect it in our internal tool to see what am I missing: https://files.facepunch.com/danielprihodko/1b0311b1/Unity_1WjQqGDVmc.png Future Plans I've been using this tool on the daily to inspect the state of our Staging servers, and I'm hoping to do the same with our medium and high-pop release servers as well. To squeeze out the most, there are additional improvements that I'd like to pursue when the time allows: Continue trimming down on annotated functions - there's still plenty to reduce. Need to expose the annotation filter to server owners - right now it's all hardcoded which is limiting Need to expand allocation tracking - right now we just track how much we allocated on main thread. We could track allocated object types, and figure out a better way to display it on Perfetto. Emit more metadata about the performance state - provide manual annotation tools to emit the scope of workload for our team, or to show cross-thread dependencies. Explore automatic capture during frame spikes. WELLIPETS https://files.facepunch.com/kaantasan/1b3111b1/wellipets-x-rust%20-%20Now%20Redeemable.jpg The wait is over!

Waking up naked on a beach and hitting trees with a rock is the purest distillation of the format, and it remains as strangely compelling as ever.

        "contents": "11 YEARS Servers are now wiped and Santa is packing up and clearing out the bodies, but we hope you enjoyed the Holiday Season. We're getting back to work after a couple of weeks off, which is why this blog is lighter than usual, but we're looking forward to the journey ahead in 2025! At the end of last year, we celebrated Rust's 11th anniversary, marking an incredible journey. The game continues to experience year-over-year growth, which is quite remarkable for being 11 years old. Rust is now bigger than ever! This year, we saw: Over 325 million game sessions Over 40 million hours played Over 5.5 million unique players Here's a recap of some of the major updates we did last year: World Update 2.0 This HUGE update completely changed the world and added many new unique points of interest around the world Road Renegades Added new forms of transport, bicycles and motorbikes Bags To Riches Finally added backpacks allowing players to carry more items and added the metal detector item Waves Of Change Updated the cargoship and helicopter events, additionally overhauled the Harbors Lighting The Way Allows players to see and navigate at night, we add a small illumination area around the player Seismic Shift Added a new item which will send notifications to your phone if an explosion is detected Quality Of Life Over 300 QOL changes from saving codelocks to floating items New Weapons Added 5 new weapons, the minigun, military flame thrower, SKS, High Calibre Revolver, Handmade SMG Alongside a metric ton of improvements and bug fixes. Rust continues to be a labour of love from all of us at Facepunch, and we couldn't have done it without your passion and feedback. Thank you for your continued support, be it playing the game, telling friends, and engaging and communicating with us. We've very much enjoyed everything we've worked on for the game this year. LOOKING FORWARD What’s in store for 2025? Consistency! Continued guaranteed monthly updates on the first Thursday of every month, alongside regular fixes, quality-of-life enhancements, improvements, and exciting holiday events. Next Month On February 6th, we'll release the Primitive update. The update will be one of the most impactful updates to date in changing the dynamics of early-game raiding and combat by introducing siege vehicles, primitive weapons, shields, and a dedicated game mode. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/119/12/2024/7n79/rust_primupdate_teaser_swordight_01.jpg The Primitive update represents a time in Rust where the already scarce technology and the usual homemade armaments and ammunition have been depleted from Rust's current setting, forcing survivors to fashion crude weapons with less sophisticated methods of attack and defence. The Siege Tower can be used to climb over exterior walls while players remain in cover. And it can be pushed or horse-drawn and has several floors, with extendable drawbridges that double up as shutters. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1911b1/rust_primupdate_teaser_armourset_01.jpg The Catapult will be a projectile launcher for longer distances that can utilise multiple projectiles such as boulders, radioactive barrels, and propane tank IEDs. While it does have wheels, its size makes it something that a vehicle or horse will have to help you move it towards your next target. The Ballista is a combination of a catapult and a large crossbow which was highly accurate given the heft of its projectiles. And in Rust, those features remain with the Ballista also having multiple ammo types, being able to do heavy damage to people, doors, and vehicles. Finally, the Battering Ram will be another addition that is driveable like a traditional vehicle, with a triggerable ram that damages building blocks in a radius. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1911b1/rust_primupdate_teaser_ballista_01.jpg As well as these new weapons and vehicles, we have been working on a variety of shields, a 4 shot mini-crossbow, and updates to melee damages and ranges. With this comes some improvements to horses, including their ability to tow the new siege weapons, and new skins to customise your primitive approach to gameplay and expression. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1911b1/rust_primupdate_teaser_swordight_02_alt.jpg Can't wait till February? Rust Staging Aux2 branch is publicly playable, allowing everyone to test and give feedback. Forwards Alongside next month's Primitive update, we have a ton of content currently in development, and if you're keeping an eye on our commits page, you'll already know some of what's on the way. This year, you can expect to see Cooking 2.0 bringing many changes to food management and unique buffs to foods, a Jungle biome featuring dangerous animals such as crocodiles and tigers, and changes to softcore and hardcore game modes. Outlined above is skimming the surface of only a few key features. We have a lot more planned. But what about? Performance? Performance is always an ongoing process. We're constantly adding and improving new features monthly, often hidden in changelogs. There is no magic button to increase performance. Instead, it is a slow process of small gains. We hired several people over the past couple of months whose sole job is focused on performance-related tasks, these are positions which never existed before, we never had staff dedicated to performance full-time, they're getting to grips with the Rust project and are already hard at work identifying and fixing issues. A recent example is Daniel's server profiler. We'll continue to share news on performance in our monthly development blogs. Old Content? As like with prior years we've set aside multiple months in our internal roadmap of light or no content. These gaps are deliberate to allow us to be versatile and adaptive to community feedback, have time to focus and address old content and improve recent content. We have a lot we can keep building upon, not all content we add to Rust is supposed to become meta, but rather adding yet another way of achieving a goal. Cheating? Repeating the words of last year's blog: Anticheat is a hugely complex topic. We work closely with Epic Games' Easy Anti-cheat, to aid in detecting and banning cheaters in Rust. We don't disclose what we do and don't do when it comes to anti-cheat for good reason. The more information we disclose publicly, the more it can assist cheaters and cheat developers to circumvent measures, it's a huge cat-and-mouse game. One of the best anti-cheat measures is obscurity. The fewer people know what EAC and we are doing, the better. This comes with the drawback of not communicating enough, on the outside, it appears we're doing nothing. Almost every month, we're shipping improvements or fixing/restricting cheat features. We've fixed several high-priority exploits upon discovery or disclosure within hours through hotfixes we don't note publicly. EAC sometimes pushes several improvements weekly, which are applied when you start the game. We continue to promise to you is we're actively monitoring and combating cheaters daily. Our internal systems keep improving, as do EAC. In past blogs I talked about server-side player culling, if a player is behind a hill and you can't see them, don't network the player to disrupt ESP cheat features. We're slowly iterating this and have tested it on live servers, we're working on getting this to the most performant state possible to work on mid-high population servers. Another feature we're exploring and want your feedback on it, is a form of premium servers. The overwhelming number of cheaters banned have Rust Steam inventory valued at below $20. A large number of long-term regular players have Rust Steam inventories of over $20. If we used this as a gate to entry for some servers, it would mean these servers would see considerably fewer cheat-related players, is this something you want? Would you play on these servers? We're still collecting data to determine the exact barrier to entry. The reason for looking at Rust's Steam Inventory price, in short, is because it's a metric that can't be spoofed and gamed easily, unlike game data. The big negative here is servers rely on a steady flow of players, new and old; this gate could have a net negative impact on the server's population and, thus, the overall gameplay experience - we'd love to hear your thoughts. This year: We've taken down over 1300 cheats-related media on social platforms. 290,000+ bans applied 57,000+ Temporary 233,000+ Permanent The majority of cheaters have been removed from the game in less than 12 hours of playtime This has lowered this to 10 hours of playtime in the last 3-months 12,617,47 Cheat reports received 1,200,000~ cheating reports received on Facepunch servers 11 YEARS OF RUST IN NUMBERS While we celebrated a fantastic 2024 for the game, we realise a lot of what we've achieved boils down to 11 years of passion from the team. And passion from the community. It's not always easy to put that into words, but we've managed to put it into numbers below. Take a look at what you've helped us achieve over the last 11 years! https://files.facepunch.com/ashcook/1b2011b1/Rust11%20Stats.png THE LAST DAYS OF RUSTMAS Twitch Drops! Hurry!

The Christmas Event is once again live! https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1311b1/rust_xmas2024_snowball_01%20%281%29.jpg If you're new to the island, here's what you can expect: As you play, you will start to hear the distinct sound of jingle bells. As soon as you do, leave the warm comfort of your base and start looking for your gifts! Two gifts are spawned per player, in a radius of about 40m from you. Run up and bash open your present to receive your Christmas gift. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. But if you have enough small presents stashed, you can 'trade up' to a medium or large gift. The contents of each present varies, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and Christmas candy. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1311b1/xmas2020_santasleigh.jpg This year, you'll still be able to find Santa hats and reindeer antlers, both of which can be worn and provide a decent amount of protection. And the lickable candy cane club is back! As well as two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring, the stocking will fill up with loot whether you've been good or not - no coal here! The larger stocking has a higher chance for better items and both last around 5-10 refills. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1311b1/rust_xmas_tree_01.jpg The advent calendar also returns and is a craftable deployable, available to everyone during the Christmas event. Once placed, you can claim an in-game surprise once every in-real-life day from the 16th of December. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1311b1/xmas_adventcalendar.jpg The Christmas event ends on January 2nd @ 19:00GMT / 14:00EST Make it a December to remember!

And remember; Facepunch will never contact you about Drops or access to any of your accounts. Stay frosty! ICE SCULPTURES Over the last few months, we've been hard at work on a new decorative features for your base. You've probably seen bits about Ice Sculptures floating about on YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit, and maybe you've even had a quick play with it on the Staging Branch, and we were really looking forward to releasing it in time for Christmas, however, we've decided to postpone the release of the Ice Sculpture DLC. This was due to concerns about the quality of what will be achievable to carve by players while it's in its current state. And due to it being a paid DLC item, we want to ensure its value and not leave players disappointed. The plan is to continue experimenting with it until we're happy, and we may look at releasing it in a different carvable material at some point next year, if it fits. 2024 REAP - RUST TURNS 11! This month marks Rust's 11th anniversary! Thank you to our incredible community for yet another spectacular year of farming, raiding, and roleplaying! With all the work we've done to consistantly release new content this year, we have seen record player counts, as well as massive increases in viewership of our Twitch events, and now more than ever, we're seeing even more ways that you all enjoy playing Rust on lots of other platforms too. So we thought we'd share some highlights from 2024 to remind ourselves of the significant changes we've brought to the world of Rust this year. And to remind ourselves that we couldn't have done it without you, the players and creators. Don't forget, to celebrate this monumental milestone, and as a thank you for your support this year, Rust is 50% off until January 2nd! And all DLCs are 40% off!

Fridge Storage Fridge storage increased to 48 slots Homing Missiles Homing missiles have been added to Bradley and attack helicopter loot crates WOLF PACKS BALANCING We spent this month bug fixing and improving the counter-plays to the wolves, as we want them to feel challenging but not unfair. The problems Using fire against wolf sometimes felt less impactful than expected, especially when wanting to avoid the fight. Even though wolves wouldn't attack as long as you kept distance and a lit torch, they would follow for a very long time. This was especially aggravating when driving wolves away from your corpse to get back your loot, but then having them still follow you and potentially cause a death spiral. Furthermore, when jumping on an elevated position to escape the wolf, it would ignore the lit torch and rush to jump up. The wolf could do very fast huge jumps sometimes up to your base's roof. The jump motion also looked weightless and not really believable. Another problem was packs of 4+ wolves. They didn't appear all the time, but players that had to face them had a really hard time. Even though packs never spawn with more than 4 wolves, they could sometimes merge. That's because wolves always come to investigate when their hear a howl, even if it comes from a wolf that does not belong to their pack. Once the player shot a wolf or they got close enough, wolves would give up stalking and weave at high speed towards their prey. For players that only had a bow, this made it hard to land more than one or two shot as the pack of wolves closed the gap. And once enough wolves were in melee range, while it was possible to prevent a single one of them from attacking thanks to hit stun, you easily got overwhelmed. Lastly it felt harder than it should have been to crouch and sneak around wolf packs, forcing players to take very long detours if they didn't want to fight. Closing words You can find more details about how we addressed those issues in the patch notes at the bottom of the page. Congrats to the players who found some of the hidden features that could be used to get the upper hand on wolves! ELECTRICITY QOL Tesla Coil Reduced tesla coil maximum power usage from 35 to 25 (no difference in time to kill) Storage Monitor Added a passthrough slot to the Storage Monitor Elevators speed Increased speed of player placed elevators by 50% Battery full charge indicator Added an output slot for when your battery is fully charged MODULAR CAR RADIOS Modular car radios are now in Rust! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241129/rust_car_radio_01.jpg This means that you can now craft a radio to place in your modular car for 120 metal fragments if you own the Voice Props Pack. Simply craft the radio and then deploy it onto the cockpit of your modular vehicle. The radio will only be operational whilst the car engine is switched on. Once the radio is deployed, anyone will be able to interact with it. Anyone with authorisation to the vehicle will be able to pick up the radio with a building hammer. The radio comes with all the same built-in and internet streamed radio stations you find in the Boom Box HELICOPTER SHREDDING Purchased Helicopters can now be picked up by the magnet crane and shredded at Junkyard. You will receive Scrap based on the helicopter type and it's current health (50% health = 50% of the Scrap). https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241202/helicopter_shredding_01.jpg Minicopter - 200 Scrap Scrap Transport Helicopter - 300 Scrap Attack Helicopter - 500 Scrap Stolen a helicopter from your neighbours? Why not destroy the evidence and get paid at the same time! UPGRADABLE HIGH EXTERNAL WALLS & GATES Wooden high external walls and gates can now be upgraded to their stone versions via the hammer context manner, similar to regular building blocks. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241204/highwallupgrade_01.jpg Additionally, high external walls now craft in batches of three. The stone high external walls requiring 1 sheet metal per craft. The stone high external gate has also been adjusted to require 1 sheet metal and only 3 gears, with its crafting cost reduced to 4000 wood/stone (down from 4500) for improved inventory management. VENDING MACHINE STATISTICS You are now able to see a bunch of statistics about your vending machine. This includes: Transaction History Highest Revenue Items Best Sold Items You can browse these stats in a wide variety of timescales: from the last 30 minutes to all-time. Some 'long term stats' are also available (all anonymous), these are: Total Sales: The total number of items purchased from the vending machine Total Unique Customers: The total number of individual customers who have made a purchase Total Repeat Customers: The total number of instances where existing customers have returned to make additional purchases. Best Customer: The customer who has made the most purchases (total count of their transactions) These stats are processed on the Serverside then communicated to clients. Here are a few Server Convars to help server owners: vendingmachine.max_returned - Specifies the maximum number of entries to return when fetching purchase history or aggregated stats (e.g., best-sold items, most revenue-generating items, etc) vendingmachine.max_processed - Limits the maximum number of sales records to process when performing operations like filtering or aggregating data, even if more records are available vendingmachine.max_history - Defines the maximum number of purchase records that the vending machine will store in memory (on Serverside) before removing older entries to make space for new ones Server owners can also run: vendingmachine.clearallvendinghistory and vendingmachine.clearallvendingcustomerhistory to clear all Vending Machine stats and long term stats respectively. LEGACY SHELTER REVOKE Once you placed your Legacy Shelter, it was possible to die and then be unable to place another. When placing down another shelter, your first one is now destroyed. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/legacyshelter_01.jpg There's one trade off: Shelters now take a few seconds to place (just like high external walls). This gives enough time to warn you that your old Shelter is going to be destroyed, as well as preventing them from being used in PVP. VARIABLE ZOOM SCOPE The 16x scope was significantly under-used considering it's intended to be military loot. This seemed to come down to it being too high of a zoom. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0511b1/chrome_QSQxVFr7df.png This scope has now been renamed to the \"variable zoom scope\" and supports 3 zoom levels: 4x, 8x & 16x. This makes it better than both of the old scopes combined & adds in a new zoom for quick target acquisition. The default keybinds are 'Page Up' to increase zoom and 'Page Down' to decrease zoom, however I fully expect more experienced players to rebind these. Try scroll wheel (if you aren't using it to switch weapons) or mouse 3 & mouse 4 (if those aren't already bound). https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241205/optionsmenu_zoomcontrols.jpg SCRAP EXCHANGE VENDOR CHANGES Now that we've reached a point where we are happy with the dynamic pricing behaviour when purchasing items with Scrap, we've decided to apply the same logic to items being sold for Scrap. Starting this month, you will notice that items that you sell to NPC vending machines for Scrap have a dynamic price applied to them. It will start the wipe with 50% less value per item sold, and can increase to an extra 100% value per item sold if no items are sold. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220331/peacekeepers_01.jpg This will hopefully make it more valuable to sell items as a wipe goes on. As with the previous changes, we'll be monitoring these and making changes as needed. UNDERWATER VISIBILITY We recently tweaked this, but your feedback made it clear there was further room for improvement. So we did just that. Underwater visibility is now nearly doubled, allowing players to see further and more clearly underwater. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_worldUpdate_diveSite_01.jpg Additionally, we've slightly increased the depth of water players can sink to before the oxygen level starts to tick down. During swimming, you are now less likely to drown to high waves. RISKY LANDMINE DISARMING Landmines now have a 15% chance to explode when being disarmed by another player, so be careful when clearing out minefields! This was always meant to be the intended gameplay behaviour for landmines, but I discovered an old bug that prevented this from working as intended. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241126/rust_landmine_disarm_01.jpg NODE SPARKLE CHANGES We've slightly modified the behaviour when hitting nodes this month. Nodes will no longer show a sparkle before they are hit for the first time, once they are hit the sparkle will appear underneath the first hit. This first hit is considered a sparkle hit and will reward the appropriate amount of resources, so it's a very slight buff to ore collecting. We did this for a few reasons: This brings their behaviour in line with the tree X marker minigame Finding the sparkle at first was slightly awkward, this feels smoother Each sparkle was a networked entity that had to be streamed in and out as the player moves around We had a sparkle per node in the world, so an average server will now have around 4.5k less entities in the world While I was at it I made some slight memory improvements so each node will take up less client and server memory. QUEUE IMPROVEMENTS While looking at collecting some data around queues, we decided to do a few minor improvements to the queue system. Up until now, the client was unaware of being in a queue, it was simply using server messaging to show the queue. Now the client knows when it has entered and exited a server queue, and can act accordingly. We now display Steam rich presence for waiting in a queue and connecting to a server. This also opens us up to do more client side related queue features in the future. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241203/WaitingInQueue.png The other change to queues we made impacts modded server owners specifically. The queue messaging system was being leverage by modded servers to implement loading screen messages via a plugin. These loading screen messages would often fight with the client messaging, and generally didn't look great. As a nice compromise, we've implemented the ability to change the \"menu tip\" message displayed in the loading screen. This can allow modded server owners to implement their own tips that may be more relevant for the particular game mode and changes specific to the server. To keep things backwards compatible, the same network message sent before will continue to work with one caveat. // Old var net = Net.sv.StartWrite(); net.PacketID(Message.Type.Message); net.String(\"Top Text\"); net.String(\"Bottom Text\"); net.Send(new SendInfo(conn)); // New var net = Net.sv.StartWrite(); net.PacketID(Message.Type.Message); net.String(\"Bolt\"); net.String(\"This server has instant craft!\"); net.Send(new SendInfo(conn)); https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241203/loadingscreen_custommessage.jpg Instead of having top and bottom text, you can change the menu tip icon displayed. Existing loading screen plugins will continue to function, but won't display a top message as that field is now used for an icon. A list of available icons names has been published on our Community GitHub repository. Only servers clearly listed in the modded section may utilize this feature. RCON SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS Another one for all the server owners out there. We've started updating the security around RCON. The server will output very prominent warning messages if you're using an insecure RCON password. In some cases, the RCON server will fail to start if the password is bad enough (i.e. \"password\" or \"changeme\") We've also added some safeguards against brute force attacks. Now when a RCON client attempts to connect with a bad password, after 5 attempts the IP address will be banned for 5 minutes. These values are all configurable through a number of new convars. There are also a few convar commands that allow you to permanently ban both IP addresses and networks. rcon.banduration (default: 300) Number of seconds to apply to any automated ban. rcon.maxpasswordfailures (default: 5) Number of failed password attempts before applying a temp ban rcon.logfailedattempts (default: true) Debug.Log all the various failed password / ban connects. Defaults to true, but large servers may want to disable due to spam rcon.permanentbanfailedips (default: false) Permanently ban IPs that exceed the failed password threshold rcon.ban_ip Permanently bans an IP or network rcon.unban_ip Removes an IP or network ban from both the permanent bans, and any temporary bans/attempts rcon.print_rcon_failed_logins Prints out the table of attempted logins that failed and if they resulted in a ban or not rcon.clear_rcon_failed_logins Removes all of the temporary failed login history/bans (does not remove permanent bans of any kind) rcon.print_rcon_bans List the permanent IP/network bans NATIVE ARM64 HARDWARE SUPPORT We've been waiting for a while for all of our third party software to natively support ARM64 hardware. This has now finally come to fruition and as the first platform to test this on, we've switched the Mac version of the game to use our native ARM64 build on Apple Silicon hardware. At the moment, Intel hardware is still supported on Mac as well and remains unaffected by this change. If this works out well, we will investigate native ARM64 support for other platforms in the future. The next most important one would likely be to natively run on ARM64 hardware in Windows laptops, but we are still waiting for some third party software to fully support this, so this will stretch a good amount into the next year at least. BUILT-IN SERVER PROFILER Up to recently we've been focusing on server performance health via tracking aggregating performance telemetry. It allowed us to have a general overview of a server's performance from birds eye view. There are point where high-level overview is not sufficient to identify where exactly slow-downs are coming from. This past month I've been working on a built-in profiler for the server. If used, it allows us to see all the code that is executed for a particular frame - allowing us to see more detail about what & how things are going wrong. https://files.facepunch.com/danielprihodko/1b0211b1/VLSYR7Arpk.png With this, we can now combine our high-level telemetry as an \"hotspot-warning\" system, while using the built-in profiler will allow us to investigate what those hotspot consist of and which parts are the most worthwhile to optimize. This will help guide our efforts in optimizing the server performance while also validating that we have successfully optimized a particular block of logic. The profiler comes with an extra benefit: this feature is going to be available for public use. Any server owner will be able to trigger it and take a look at the data. You'll be able to see both what vanilla server does, as well as if there's anything that Mods are actively doing. How to Generate a snapshot Note 1: This is currently only available for servers hosted on Windows machines. Linux support is next to come. https://files.facepunch.com/danielprihodko/1b0411b1/jCm3Ix8EAJ.png First, the feature needs to be activated when starting the server. You must launch the server executable with `-enableProfiler` Once the server boots up, you can run the following console command: `profile.perfsnapshot ` (all parameters are optional) delay is in seconds, by default set to 15 name is the name of the snapshot file, by default is \"Profile\" frames is the number of frames to includes in the snapshot - default is 10, has a max of 10 Once the delay expires (you'll see messages in global chat), it will record the requested number of frames, generate and compress a snapshot - you will find it in /server/ /profiler/ .json.gz Note 2: if something goes wrong during generation the file won't be created(youl'l can it in server log file). I'll be continuing iterating on the profiler, so I'll iron out any left-overs. Note 3: Taking a snapshot causes server to take a performance hit for a couple seconds. Make sure to give enough delay to avoid disturbing the server population too much. When not taking a snapshot, the impact is none/unnoticeable. Exploring The Snapshot You can extract the compressed snapshot using any utility that understands GZip (Windows11 explorer, 7zip). The snapshot uses Google Event Format, so you can use any tool to view it. For example, I've been Perfetto UI to visualize the data - just drag and drop the json into the view and you can start exploring.

        "contents": "T1 HANDMADE SMG This month we're adding new weapons, firstly filling a gap in the weapon lineup, the Handmade SMG is unlockable near the end of the T1 tech tree. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241107/rust_t1smg_inspect_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241107/rust_t1smg_workbench_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241107/rust_t1smg_workbench_02.jpg While it lacks accuracy and raw damage, it compensates for this with sheer volume, letting players unleash a hail of bullets. Skilled survivors can use it to stay competitive by timing their attacks and positioning themselves carefully, allowing for surprise bursts against better-equipped foes. SKS Unlockable at the start of the T3 tech tree, the SKS bridges the gap between the SAR and the M39. This mid-tier powerhouse combines punchy damage with accuracy, making it a reliable pick for players who want a no-nonsense rifle with solid range and stopping power. The SKS delivers balanced performance with a kick that seasoned survivors will appreciate. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240430/SKS_hero_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240430/SKS_hero_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240430/SKS_hero_04.jpg IMPROVED WOLF AI Hello I'm Maverick! I recently joined Facepunch to work full-time on the AI and it's been a blast so far. This month we're releasing the first step of a major AI overhaul. We're starting small by just updating the wolf, but long-term the goal is to update scientists and all other animals. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241106/rust_november_wolves_03.jpg The why The current wolf feels a bit like a landmine: if you're walking around and you didn't see it or hear its footsteps, you die. That issue is of course amplified in the pitch black night. Since wolves runs faster than players, once spotted your only options are to try to kill it before it kills you, or jump out of reach if possible. Since the wolf charges in a straight line, you don't really have to aim and if you have a nailgun or better it's just a matter of unloading the magazine as fast as you can. Assuming you spotted the wolf before it spotted you, hunting it was not really engaging. When shot from a distance wolves don't charge and just flee very far away, often forcing you to engage in a long hike to get its loot. The result of this is that the wolf was either frustratingly hard to handle, or trivial, with no in between. This motivated us to reshape the wolf into something that would pose a challenge that feels fair, and can be tackled in multiple ways. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241106/rust_november_wolves_01.jpg The how I could write an exhaustive list of all the new behaviors, but I think it'll be way more fun for you to experiment and I'm confident the community will find even the cool hidden ones. Forget everything you know about the old wolves and just try out stuff that seems like it should work! QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES IO Arrows New arrows that show input/outputs when looking at IO deployables Floating objects drift down rivers Corpses, Boogie Boards, Boats now float down rivers Hear player voices over CCTV Listen in on the group taking Oil Rig Disable Monument CCTV Can now damage monument CCTV cameras to disable them for 5 minutes Copy Paste IDs in F7 menu Easily get a player's ID when using the Report menu Add vendor NPC's to all Water Wells Every Water Well variant now has killable vendor GESTURE PACK DLC This month we've added more ways for players to communicate and express themselves with the introduction of our first gesture pack - available now on Rust's permanent item store. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241104/gesturepack_hero_01.jpg The pack includes 8 new gestures: Rock Paper Scissors (Mini-game) Loser / L Hand Knuckle Crack No-No / Wagging Finger Cut Throat Shush Watching You Finger Gun NOTE: You'll need to assign the gestures to a slot on the gesture wheel via our new gesture wheel customisation on the main menu under Options > Gestures (learn more below) Rock Paper Scissors Included in the pack is our first ever gesture minigame; Rock Paper Scissors. Trying to decide which teammate does the next farming run? Or who gets to use the L96? Now you can settle the score with a round of Rock Paper Scissors. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241106/rust_gesturepack_rps_01.jpg To play, select Rock Paper Scissors from the gesture wheel then wait for an opponent to interact with you to start the minigame. (Note: you'll need to assign the gesture to a new slot via the main menu for it to appear on the gesture wheel) Once a 2nd player joins, you'll be prompted with UI to choose a hand/option to play - use the numerical keys on your keyboard to make a selection of either rock, paper or scissors. Both you and your opponent will have 10 seconds to make a choice; If the timer runs out or a player moves too far away, the mini-game will end. After selections are made by both parties, each player will \"shoot\" simultaneously on the count of three to determine a win, lose or draw result. We look forward to seeing how you all use the minigame - our plan is to add similar interactive gestures in the near future. GESTURE WHEEL CUSTOMISATION In order to support the new gesture pack we’ve added the ability to customise your gesture wheel this month, as well as adding a new wheel so you can access double the gestures. You’ll find this in the Options > Gestures menu. Customising your wheel is straightforward from this menu. Simply click on a slot to change what gesture is assigned, or use RMB to clear a slot. You can access the second wheel via the arrows at the top, and use E/Q to switch between gesture wheels in-game. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241105/gesturewheel_menuoption.jpg We’re just exposing two wheels as even with the new gestures you won’t be able to fill them up, but we’ve now got the system built so we can add more wheels as we release more gestures down the line. RADIOACTIVE WATER BUFF The introduction of Radioactive Water last month was pretty weak. We felt it needed a buff to bring it in line with the original vision. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_radwater_sprinkler_01.jpg Here are the changes to Radioactive Water: We have increased the radiation amount from sprinklers by 70% We have increased the radiation amount from splashes by 40% This makes Radioactive Water the counter against full kits that it should be. MIXING TABLE IMPROVEMENTS This month I added some nice QOL improvements for the mixing table. You can now click a recipe to add the required ingredients to the mixing table inventory, in the correct slots. Repeat clicking will stack the additional ingredients required to produce another of the same item. Shift-clicking will add the ingredients for the maximum number of items you can afford to produce. The recipe names of recipes you cannot afford to produce are now also greyed out, making it much quicker to see what you can currently create. Finally, I made some minor performance and memory improvements for the mixing table UI. ANTICHEAT UPDATE Since our last anti-cheat update back in July, we have applied an additional 91,676 bans, 19,398 of these were temporary, and the remaining were permanent bans. Here's the breakdown per patch: World Update 2.0 - October 22,473 permanent bans 6,735 temporary bans 113,580 reports Time To Kill - September 14,885 permanent bans 5,294 temporary bans 77,871 reports Stay Alert - August 22,827 permanent bans 1,386 temporary bans 105,031 reports Road Renegades - July 12,093 permanent bans 5,983 temporary bans 102,764 reports Notes Patch-specific report data is only from Facepunch Official servers due to data reliability originating from non-official servers, the total number of reports across all server since July is 5.3 million. Bans that were later reverted are excluded from these metrics. Bans are placed for multiple reasons. The numbers above do not strictly reflect only cheat-related bans, but cheat-related bans make up the vast majority of bans. A single player can receive multiple bans, for example, if a user is temporarily banned and then later switched to a permanent ban, this is counted as 2 bans in the above metrics . The above is to provide context and transparency, not to state we're doing a good job, there is much more to be done in this area, and we are continuing to work on it. Next In July, I talked about server-side player culling, if a player is behind a hill and you can't see them, don't network the player. We feel we've done all we can in internal testing and will now roll out this change slowly across all official servers starting this month. We teamed up with a third party to handle takedowns on our behalf. One of the core objectives is aimed at cheat-related material. The takedowns will be made at the request of Facepunch staff after manual review. There is no automation, and there is no room for innocent content to be taken down. We've taken down over 1200 cheats-related media on social platforms. We're working continuing to work on several other legal fronts to disrupt cheaters. COPY PASTE Copy Paste is a new admin tool that allows server admins to copy, paste & save bases! This opens up a number of new workflows such as allowing admins to submit a copy of a base when they are submitting a bug report. It also will speed up testing on staging, allowing you to paste platforms with every item you need to test new content. If you are interested, head over to the wiki page to learn how to use it!

FACEPUNCH SERVERS Many official Facepunch servers, especially those in Eastern and Western Europe and Eastern US, have been upgraded to new, higher-performance hardware. This long-awaited upgrade should significantly improve stability in these regions during peak time. Some servers also received a slight increase in their max player capacities. Following this update, you may find that your favourite Facepunch server is no longer on your favourites list. To find it, please use the search bar in-game and, if needed, enable the \"show empty servers\" option. Upgrades for other regions will be rolled out in the coming weeks. All blueprints have been transferred, so no progress has been lost.",

The candies you collect can be upgraded for better loot! This year's Halloween event will run until November 7th. HERE BE MONSTERS Wondering what to do with all those body parts you've collected? Build your own monster! To start putting together your morbid creation, first, you must slay the scarecrows and mummies that roam the lands. Once you've collected a head, torso, and legs, craft yourself a Frankenstein's table and place the body parts within it. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211026/monstertable_wakeup.jpg Awaken your new pet monster and control it by pressing \"P\". The monster will follow your orders without question. It'll follow you around the map, defend you if attacked and help slay foes you wish to attack. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211026/frankenstein_lab_close.jpg If you're having trouble accessing the pet menu or already have a key bound to \"P\" then use the following console command: bind X +pets or open the in-game controls menu. THE RIFTS OPEN Cultists are said to have been opening portals across the island, while others believe it's a Cobalt experiment code-named R.U.I.N gone horribly wrong. Not much is known about these portals - what they do or where they go, but only a few brave souls have entered through and made it back alive. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b2811b1/dungeonportal_01.jpg Do you dare to enter the rift? Server owners can adjust the portal count using the halloweendungeon.population convar. CURSED ARTICLES This year, we've added three Halloween-themed items - one purchasable, and two free. MASKS Frankenstein and Mummy masks https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241024/rust_halloween_masks_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241024/rust_halloween_masks_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241024/rust_halloween_masks_01.jpg DRACULA CAPE + MASK Dracula cape & mask can be found on the limited item store. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231021/halloween_dracula_01.jpg",

        "contents": "RADTOWN One of the emblematic locations from legacy Rust makes a comeback: Radtown. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_35.jpg We turned this monument from a bunch of blocky garage buildings, into a refreshed new gameplay space. We tried to preserve the proportions and purpose of each location while opening up new paths and adding way to improve the flow of movement and cover throughout. Exteriors https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_28.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_31.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_15.jpg Interiors https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_11.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_50.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_48.jpg CLIFFS We have completely reworked all cliffs in the game. The new cliffs come in two types, tall coastal cliffs placed close to the ocean and sloped inland cliffs covering hills and mountains. A lot of effort was made into making them not only look realistic, but also easy to traverse. You can run up the inland cliffs with ease, while the coastal cliffs can be scaled by jumping on the rocky ledges and protrusions. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_cliffs02_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_cliffs02_02.jpg In addition we have added many new coastal rocks close to the shore to further spice up the world. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_cliffs02_11_alt1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_worldupdate_preview_18.jpg REVAMPED ROCK FORMATIONS We have completely revamped all large rock formations in the game and decided to bring back some of the old fan favorites. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rocks02_10.jpg Formations such as the god rock, anvil rock and arch rock all return to the game. Completely new rock formations have been added and some of them even spawn off shore allowing for more base building possibilities than ever before. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rocks_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rocks_08.jpg UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTS In Rust, you will now find several different canyons, lakes, and oasis of various sizes in each procedurally generated map. Canyons, Lakes, and Oases – each offering a fresh way to play with their own pros and cons. Canyons provide narrow pathways for ambushes but can be risky to navigate. Lakes create opportunities for resource gathering and farming but leave you vulnerable in open water. Oases are lush safe havens with valuable resources but will become hotspots for fierce competition. Canyons These towering landscapes offer fresh opportunities for ambushes and base building. While the narrow pathways and steep drops make for thrilling combat and strategic locations. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_worldupdate_preview_24.jpg Canyons can be rich in resources, but don't get too greedy and get caught out. Lakes These scenic water bodies add a new twist to the gameplay, offering great spots for fishing, resource gathering, farming and base-building by the shore. However, the open water leaves you exposed to attacks, and swimming can slow you down when trying to make a quick escape. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_lakes_07.jpg Oasis These rare paradises amidst the harsh desert. These lush areas are perfect for setting up base, gathering, farming, and finding vital resources like water. But be warned: Oases will attract other players looking to take advantage of these havens. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_oasis_10.jpg RIVERS Rivers are now longer, flow more naturally, and widen the longer they get. This as well as the new unique environments required a larger water system overhaul to support different water types at any altitude. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rivers02_09.jpg The ocean is now fully culled underneath the terrain, and lakes no longer stretch beyond their boundaries. Overall, it's a much more robust and future proof system. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rivers02_11.jpg HIGH CALIBER REVOLVER The High Caliber Revolver is a hand-crafted, single-action revolver that uses 5.56 ammo. Built for precise, long-range shots rather than rapid fire, it demands a steady hand for maximum accuracy. Its slower fire rate reflects the single-action design, but the power and precision make each shot count. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_highcaliberrevolver_tabletop_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_highcaliberrevolver_tabletop_06.jpg Unlockable at a Tier 2 workbench, the High Caliber is for survivors who prioritize accuracy and impact over speed. LEGACY WOOD PILE Welcome back wood piles! These will spawn in the snow, and temperate biomes. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240917/legacy_woodpile_01.jpg They function just like our traditional ore piles, but for wood! Harvestable with a rock, hatchet or chainsaw. A great source of wood early in the game to start off your Rust journey. DIVE SITES Ocean Wreck Buoys We’ve remodelled the old floating bottle indicators on the surface of dive sites into more solid buoys. They are much more visible which will help with finding dive sites. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240919/rust_worldUpdate_buoy_01.jpg Dive Sites The Dive Sites themselves have been refreshed this month, with an entirely new set of three possible options replacing the old sites. All sites now spawn the same amount of loot (6 crates). Each site has new unique environment art and topology. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_worldUpdate_diveSite_01.jpg Flora and Fauna Alongside the new Buoys and Dive Sites, we've overhauled the underwater foliage with a graphical update, and tweaked the visuals on fish so they behave more naturally. You might even find a couple of other critters down there. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_worldUpdate_diveSite_07.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_worldUpdate_diveSite_04.jpg DIVER PROPULSION VEHICLE (DPV) We've added small new handheld dive vehicle this month. The DPV can be crafted and kept in your inventory until you need it. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_dpv_01.jpg It's then used like so: Select it and deploy it into any water that's at least 1 metre deep Interact with the fuel tank and add some low grade fuel \"Mount\" it to hold onto the handles and drive it around https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_dpv_03.jpg Using the DPV, you can travel underwater significantly faster than you could by swimming. Once you're done with it, simply dismount and pick it up. Fuel will automatically be removed and added to your inventory, or dropped if you don't have any space. Note: Currently players will need to manually remove fuel before picking up the DPV. This will be corrected in a hotfix asap https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_dpv_04.jpg WATER WELL UPDATE Waterwells aren’t exactly the most popular monument in Rust, so this month we decided to make them a little more interesting. You will now find a new vendor at some NPC’s that can offer a random selection of teas and farming equipment that shuffles every X minutes. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240924/rust_waterwell_NPC_02.jpg What’s special about this NPC is that this is the first vendor that is available in non safe zones. This means they can be killed! If that happens they will respawn after a while, but that won’t trigger the vendor to refresh or have any loot so there’s no real purpose. Try and be nice! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240924/waterWell_foodcache_01.jpg You will also find a new food cache with basic teas and high quality food items, and some planters that are automatically filled with random plants periodically. These plants have a high priority of having good genes, so they’re a great way to give your farm base a quick boost. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240924/waterWell_planter_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240924/waterWell_planter_02.jpg RADIOACTIVE WATER We've added a new gameplay feature to the world: Radioactive Water! This is available at two locations in the new Radtown monument. Players will be able to harvest it with any regular water container, be it: a bota bag, water jug or the tanker module for vehicles. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_radtown_38.jpg Radioactive Water has a few properties: splashing it on plants will instantly kill them, splashing it on players (via throwing your water from a container, or via a sprinkler) will irradiate them. Carrying a large amount of it in your inventory will damage you, and finally looting a players body will irradiate you if there's enough radioactive water in their inventory. These properties make Radioactive Water a great choice for a number of things: from instantly resetting your farm, to being a great counter to those players raiding you in full gear. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_radwater_splash_01.jpg The backend work done on Radioactive Water opens up a number of gameplay possibilities in the future as any item (in code) can now be marked as Radioactive. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_radwater_sprinkler_01.jpg We can't wait to see what creations you come up with! FRONTIERSMAN PACK This month we're introducing a new addition to Rust's permanent store, the Frontiersman Pack. The pack includes three items: Frontier Hazmat Suit, Frontier Hatchet, Blunderbuss https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240924/rust_frontiersman_hero_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240924/rust_frontiersman_pack_collection_01.jpg Frontiersman hazmat suit The Frontiersman Hazmat is a handcrafted survival suit, built for those who brave the wilderness. Forged from durable felt and leather, it’s designed to shield its wearer from the harsh weather, unseen enemies, and the dangers of the wild. The Frontiersman suit is a hazmat replacement skin that can be applied while crafting the hazmat or skinned using the repair table. The Frontiersman suit offers no in-game bonuses. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_frontiersman_hero_07.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_frontiersman_hero_21.jpg Blunderbuss The Blunderbuss is a handcrafted, frontier-inspired shotgun that brings a classic, rugged aesthetic to the Double Barrel. This skin reimagines the weapon, turning it into a more traditional tool of survival from a bygone era https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_frontiersman_pack_blunderbuss_03.jpg Frontier Hatchet Inspired by the traditional tomahawk, featuring a rugged design with several charms attached. This unique skin transforms the hatchet into a symbol of frontier survival. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_frontiersman_pack_hatchet_01.jpg Available now on the item store. WALLPAPER CHANGES Based on your feedback following last month’s wallpaper release, you can now place wallpapers on building block hardsides, but only inside your base! Any exposed hardside wallpaper will be removed by the next decay tick. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Spray Can Improvements Spray Can will now remember the shipping container colour through deaths and restarts Note World Model Note World Model Added Underwater Visibility Underwater visibility improved, allowing for enhanced long-distance sight Repair Bench The repair bench now displays icons alongside text for repair costs.

Map makers should update their maps with the new rock assets to maintain compatibility. The reason we're removing the old assets is to ensure we're keeping the game running as optimal as possible and not needlessly loading unused assets into memory.",

        "contents": "DIGITAL CLOCK Meet the Digital Clock, a new craftable item, a simple but powerful addition to your base's electrical setup. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240823/digital_clock_02.jpg When powered, it displays the current server time Consumes 1 power Available at the Tier 2 Workbench Craftable for 100 Metal Fragments The clock also allows you to set up alarms. When an alarm goes off, the power will pass through, allowing you to trigger any sort of circuit inside your base at specific times. Whether you want to automate your farms, activate traps, or control lighting systems, you can set up to five alarms simultaneously. GCO WEAPON ATTACHMENT A powerful new cutting-edge experimental weapon attachment for those who crave more damage and speed in their shots. The Gas Compression Overdrive attachment boosts projectile damage and velocity, allowing you to hit harder. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_202409_ttk_heroimage.jpg However, this extra power comes with trade-offs, a slower fire rate and increased recoil. If you can handle the extra kick, this attachment is maybe for you. The GCO attachment works on the following weapons: Thompson, SAR, SAP, M92, M39 and the Custom SMG. WALLPAPERS This month, we're adding wallpapers, a new way to decorate your base's interior. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240828/rust_wallpaper_placement_01.jpg Wallpapers can only be applied to the interior side of your walls. Purely visual, they don't provide any additional protection, are easy to remove and won't interfere with the deployment of any other items. Default blueprint Crafting cost: 10 cloth for 2 pieces of wallpaper Includes 'Vintage' default skin in 4 colours - blue, red, green and yellow https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_defaultskins_02.jpg Just like other deployable items, wallpapers can be skinned during crafting, in a repair bench or after being deployed using the spray can. Wallpaper Starter Pack In addition to the 4 wallpapers skins unlocked by default, you can purchase the Wallpaper Starter Pack which features 22 extra wallpaper skins for styling your base. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_starterpack_collection.jpg Skins included in the wallpaper starter pack, as pictured above: Clouds Yellow Stripe Blue Diamond Fleur (3 variants) Retro (3 variants) Subway (2 variants) Geometric (2 variants) Polka Dots (3 variants) Wainscotting (3 variants) Venetian Plaster (3 variants) https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_subway_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_gallery_11.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_gallery_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_gallery_06.jpg The Wallpaper Starter Pack is available for purchase in-game or through the Steam's item store. COLOURBLIND ACCESSIBILITY As part of my Hackweek last month, I explored some ways we can make playing Rust more accessible for players that experience different forms of colour blindness. Colour blindness is experienced by up to 8% of men and 0.5% of women, so it likely affects a good portion of our player base. We’ve tried to identify problematic areas in the game world, as well as in our UI, and then make those colours configurable so every player can customise the look of their game to meet their needs. Since colour blindness comes in many forms, we’ve exposed each option individually as well as some presets that we think will help for more common forms of the condition. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240829/rust_accessibility_colours_menu.jpg We’ve exposed the following options: Tree marker colours Health Bar colour Hunger Bar colour Hydration Bar colour Team Name tag colour Enemy Name tag colour Ally Name tag colour (eg. marked friendly in the contacts system) Monument blocked colour (the new radius that appears when building close to a monument) Mushroom colour https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240829/rust_accessibility_colours_treemarker.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240829/rust_accessibility_colours_mushrooms.jpg We also adjusted the contrast of the icons in the Hunger/Health/Hydration bar to make them stand out a bit more when in snowy/very bright regions. Please get in touch if we’ve missed a colour you find problematic to see, or if there are other accessibility options you think could help make playing Rust more comfortable. You can contact us via the F7 report menu, or opening a new Support ticket. TUNNEL NETWORK VISIBILITY LAYER Way, way back in the ancient times of December 2022, we shipped a feature that allowed us to separate the above ground and below ground networking groups, improving client performance and reducing network traffic. Unfortunately, we had to disable it pretty quickly on launch as we discovered an edge case where a small number of elevators that started in the above ground layer and ended in the below ground layer would teleport players into a void. To resolve this, we needed to rework how elevators functioned internally. This work has finally been completed, so we’re re-enabling the feature this month. Fingers crossed the feature sticks this time! This change should be invisible to players and offer better performance. ERRORS QOL I think it was time to say goodbye to this debug gibberish spammed in chat everytime you try to build anything. https://files.facepunch.com/Flavien/fzm2QugDAJs1Jwm0.png These errors have been moved from the chat to toast messages, which are just as responsive and most importantly, visible to players playing with the chat disabled. We wanted to reduce the confusion by making these errors more specific, when possible. The common \"Cannot build in this area\" now becomes \"Blocked by X\", mentioning the name of the entity blocking you. It works with deployables, vehicles, building blocks and players. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0511b1/chrome_ldKRORzVav.jpg The infamous \"Too close from another building\" error message will now be \"Too close to X\". It will also briefly highlight the building block in question. When trying to upgrade a building block, you'll now get a clear explanation of what exactly is preventing the upgrade. We've also re-ordered the message priority of a few common deployables. So you now get \"Must be placed on a construction\" instead of \"Not enough space\" message when trying to place a bed on the terrain for example. A new convar has been added if you prefer to keep the error messages in chat: client.errortoasts_in_chat LOCALIZATION A lot of effort has been put into improving Rust's localization this month. Most of the UI screens are now displaying right-to-left languages correctly Many screens with truncated texts have been fixed Unlocalized texts have been addressed This is ongoing work, it's not finished yet, and more improvements are planned for the coming months. Thanks to everyone contributing to Rust localization, dedicating their time to make the game more accessible to non-English speakers. WORLD UPDATE PLAYTEST Today, we're opening Rust Staging - Aux02 beta branch for public testing to gather feedback and bug testing ahead of next month's world update release, which is one, if not the most significant updates, this year. The World Update aims to address many long-standing community requests surrounding the world. The update will revamp cliffs, rivers, dive sites, and add new, unique environmental areas such as canyons, lakes, and desert oases. Additionally, some throwbacks to Legacy Rust by bringing back an updated Radtown monument and Legacy Wood Piles. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_worldupdate_preview_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_worldupdate_preview_25.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_worldupdate_preview_20.jpg There is plenty more to look forward to with a new weapon, the high-calibre revolver, new Hazmat skin, and so much more. We're excited about this world update and want your feedback to allow us to adjust and tweak as necessary. As a note of caution, everything on the branch is subject to change, and map wipes will happen at irregular intervals over the month. The world update will be released on October 3rd. How to access To access the playtest, please follow the steps below: On Steam download Rust - Staging Branch Right-click Rust - Staging Branch on your Steam library, and select Properties Navigate to \"Betas\" tab Next to \"Beta Participation\" select \"aux02 - upandcoming\" Steam will begin to download and apply the update Open Rust - Staging Branch via Steam and play How to give feedback To give direct feedback in-game, press F7 and fill out the form, additionally, you can join our Discord and discuss the changes in the channel \"staging-aux2\" Mappers An unfortunate side effect of this revamp is that new assets will be added, and old assets will be removed. This will cause some instability for custom maps and map makers, one example is the older cliff and rock formations will be removed. We'll post updates on the exact changes in community mapping Discords and our social media closer to release.

WELLIPETS X RUST Wellipets’ iconic Frog Boots were added to Rust as a gift for players who owned the game while it was in Early Access between 2013-2018 - as a thanks for supporting us while we took the game from its very humble and janky beginnings, to becoming what it is today. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240823/rust_wellipets_heroimage_01.jpg And now, we've officially partnered with Wellipets to unite both the digital and physical world - An IRL Frog Wellington Boot in original Rust colours (one green, one black), and an exclusive in-game Frog Boot Helmet if you buy the Rust edition of the boots. Executed in black and Batrachian green and contrasted with their hallmark yellow eyes, these wellington boots boast a distinctive colour combination, both as a legacy Rust item, and now a real, practical but fashionable item. They feature a ladder grip outsole to provide improved traction during wet weather and are decorated with hand painted details at the logo and mouth. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240823/rust_wellipets_hat_01.jpg Every physical pair comes with a key to unlock the new in-game item, once shipped. The boots are expected to start shipping at the end of November. Discover the story and pre-order your pair here: https://wellipets.com/wellipets-x-rust MODDING API BREAK Heya! My name is Daniel, I'm a new member of the Rust development team - I've joined about a month ago. My primary objective is to work on Performance and it's various facets for Rust. I'm hoping to be posting about the ongoing work in the future. In the coming update, I've made some changes to code that we'll be shipping that will break some mods that rely on our internal object pooling utility, Facepunch.Pool. If you're the owner of one of these mods that see errors around invalid use of \"Pool.Free\", then you should try switching to \"Pool.FreeUnmanaged\", and if that still doesn't work, then \"Pool.FreeUnsafe\"(in last case if you're using FreeUnsafe with a collection, make sure to clear it). I'm making this breaking change because our old API were unsafe and allowed for memory leaks and bugs. Instead, I've introduced a couple replacements that aim to be stricter and as a result safer. Pool.Free is now 3 separate methods: Pool.Free where T : Pool.IPooled or a couple collections with T : IPooled. Calls Clear() and optionally returns each element back to Pool Pool.FreeUnmanaged where T is a collection of non-IPooled-implementing types. Calls Clear() or an equivalent Pool.FreeUnsafe for any T, just returns it back to pool The following methods are marked obsolete and will be removed when October Update lands or have been removed: Pool.GetList - obsolete Pool.FreeList - obsolete Pool.FreeListAndItems - obsolete Pool.FreeMemoryStream - obsolete Pool.ClearList - obsolete Pool.FreeDynamic - removed LINUX DEDICATED SERVER UPDATE Our dedicated server builds on Linux currently support Debian 10 / Ubuntu 18 or later. Due to third party software we rely on slowly removing support for these platforms, we will soon be forced to change the minimum requirement for our Linux dedicated server builds to Debian 11 / Ubuntu 20 or later. If you're hosting your own server or offer managed servers to your clients, please update to Debian 11 / Ubuntu 20 or later as soon as possible.",

        "contents": "TIN CAN ALARM This month, we're adding the Tin Can Alarm, a new primitive trap made from hanging tin cans. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240729/tincan_alarm_02_1080p.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240729/tincan_alarm_06_1080p.jpg Crossing its wire will trigger the trap and cause a loud clatter, alerting anyone nearby to your presence. You can deploy it anywhere from your base to inside monuments. Use it strategically to cover access points and defend your positions. REPLICATED BUSH SOUNDS This month, we are changing how the classic bush rustle sounds work. Bush sounds will now be audible to players around you. Just like with footsteps, you now need to take care of when you make noise in bushes. Going slower through a bush makes a quieter sound than when running through it. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240731/bush_sounds_01.jpg This change will also cause the rustles made in hot air balloon tarps to be audible to players nearby, and operates in the same way as the bushes. UNDERWATER ITEMS https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b3011b1/chrome_6klbgq2xDw.png Dropped items that end up in bodies of water will now sink more realistically instead of just dropping like they are still falling through air. As well as slowing down and getting shifted around by currents they will also emit some bubbles as they move and when they hit the ocean floor. This should make finding these items a little bit easier. ZIPLINE IMPROVEMENTS We’ve made several changes to the powerline zipline system this month to make it a bit more pleasant to use. Ziplines will now pick the furthest possible destination instead of the closest We’ve increased the maximum length a zipline can run from 150m to 185m Ziplines can now terminate at a higher point on the powerline structure and will pick these higher destinations when possible, reducing the amount of climbing required to continue the zipline. You can no longer get dismounted by trees when on a zipline. We already had several systems in place to prevent trees spawning in zipline paths, but it still happened very rarely. These changes should result in longer, higher ziplines that are safer to use. NPC VENDOR PRICE CHANGES After looking over the data from last months wipe, it was clear that the dynamic vendor pricing system wasn’t operating as well as it could have. It tended to drop to 50% off all items relatively quickly in the wipe. We’ve made a couple of changes this month: Price changes now operate in real time rather than based on in-game time. This should be more understandable and will work correctly on servers that manipulate in-game time. Price changes now take place every 5 real time hours. Last month the prices changed every 15 minutes in real time by default, so this will make the prices change much more slowly. As usual we’ll keep an eye on this and make changes going forwards. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Trains break barricades Trains can break through barricades that are deployed too close to the tracks. Bike fast turns Hold the Crouch key while driving to perform a faster turn Sidecar bike physics Sidecar bikes now drive more like regular motorbikes. Horse terrain holes Horses can now enter terrain holes - Train tunnels, the launch site ramp etc. Fire mode switch Switching your gun firemode will now play a sound. Storage Adaptors collision Can now walk through Storage Adaptors attached to boxes. Hurt screen overlay toggle Can now turn off the blood on screen when getting hurt. Saved code lock input The last entered code is now saved between sessions.

Facepunch officially turned 15 not too long ago and we wanted to celebrate the occasion by making all of our games 50% off - including Rust and all Rust DLCs! You can get your discounts on all Facepunch games through the Steam store. Rewind to 2009, when Garry, released Garry's Mod: a sandbox game with no rules, from a mod, to officially listing it on Steam. No objectives, just pure, unadulterated freedom. Want to create a giant robot out of bathtubs? Go for it. Fancy launching a thousand explosive barrels into the sky? Why not! Garry's Mod was, and still is, the ultimate playground for gamers with a wild imagination. Fast forward to 2013, and we began work on Rust. This isn’t just any survival game; it’s a brutal, post-apocalyptic showdown where you start with nothing but a rock and a dream. Gathering resources, building shelters, forging alliances—or betraying them—Rust has taken survival gaming to a whole new level. It's a place where the only rule is: trust no one, but have fun trying. And now, in 2024, we're working on our biggest update for Rust yet, with more Twitch events planned, and even more cool things to come to the game for all types of players. There has never been a better time to play Rust. LOOTROOM 3D PRINTS https://files.facepunch.com/ashcook/1b1511b1/rust_x_lootroom_announcement-compressed.jpg It's Official - You Can Now Get Licensed 3D Printed Rust Items! After years of watching from the side lines, we're proud to officially announce that we've partnered with Lootroom! Lootroom are now our partner for fully licensed 3D printed guns and more. So we're now working closer with them, providing this lovely and dedicated team with in-game assets to ensure that they continue to deliver high quality products to Rust fans. Here's Lootroom's story: \"It's mid-2018 and during an exciting Rust weekend with good friends, we kept joking about the fact that furnaces in Rust always have to be running. This gave rise to the desire to have a small real Rust furnace on the desk - as a reminder of this great wipe. It didn't take long and it became clear: a 3D printer was needed! The test phase went well and we were so impressed with the result that we published the furnace on various platforms and received a lot of positive feedback. When the first purchase requests came in, we knew that the whole thing had potential and that there were many Rust enthusiasts around the world who shared our interest in IRL loot. After some preparation, a first small online store was created and the perfect name with the necessary domains was also found - Lootroom. Initially, our store only consisted of the furnace in various sizes, followed by the Eoka and the P2. But after countless requests, the Rust AK default was added in May 2020 after a slight delay due to Covid-19 - a real monster compared to the smaller products we had previously offered. For us, this also involved a learning and conversion process, as our previous way of working was geared towards the smaller items. For example, we needed new shipping boxes. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcook/1b1511b1/2.jpg Lone Design, the online store for Rust server plugins, became aware of us quite early on and we were also able to offer our products there - and thus reach even more Rust players. At the same time, we also set up a successful Etsy store and have since broken the magic mark of 1k sales and 100k turnover. As we became better known, we received more and more requests for different skins and other irl loot. We created internal ranking lists with the most requested items, which we then gradually worked through. Over the years, we have continuously expanded our store and now stock more than 70 different Rust items. A special milestone was achieved in September 2021: together with one of the most successful Rust content creators ever - Blooprint - we had his Blooprint SAR on offer for a limited time. The demand was overwhelming and it gave us great pleasure to see how much gamers around the world celebrated our products. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1511b1/PXL_20230106_191127996.PORTRAIT.jpg We invested in more and more modern 3D printers, a new online presence and founded the official Lootroom GmbH in September 2022, based in Nuremberg, Germany. We now operate more than 20 3D printers that print IRL loot almost continuously. Our factory is streamed live on Twitch, Kick and YouTube to give anyone interested an insight into the creation process. Naturally, we prioritize the quality of our handmade products while also maintaining a consistent stock to ensure prompt shipping. Customer service and engagement with the Rust community are equally important to us. We have already shipped to over 45 countries around the world and look forward to every new customer that we can make happy with our IRL Loot. We put a lot of passion into our unique products. All of this now leads to the possibility to offer our products as officially licensed Rust IRL loot. We are very hyped and incredibly excited to be working with our friends at Facepunch.\" https://files.facepunch.com/ashcook/1b1511b1/28.jpg Please go and show them some love, and place an order for your favourite weapon or prop.

When you think of the PC games that have defined the last decade, <strong>Rust</strong>, originally designed by GMod and Half-Life community legend Garry Newman, doesn't normally spring to mind. At its conception, the enormous survival game served as an alternative to DayZ. Later, as developer Facepunch rebuilt and reshaped the idea, Rust started to have more in common with Stalker. Now, 11 years since its alpha release, it's something entirely of its own, a surreal, often slapstick world where everything can kill you. One of the most enduringly popular games of the last decade, Rust is currently enjoying a resurgence on Steam - and deservedly so. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-survival-game-players\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/rust-console-commands\">Rust Commands - most useful console admin list 2024</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/road-renegades\">Getting around Rust just got a whole lot easier with this new update</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/backpacks\">Rust dev finally adds highly requested backpacks, says pets are coming</a> ",

        "contents": "MOTORBIKES https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240703/motorbike_riding_01.jpg Motorbikes can now be found at several monument locations. One is a single-person bike and one has a sidecar as well, where a second player can sit and use weapons. These are relatively fast and nimble vehicles, useful for quickly traversing the map using low grade fuel. If damaged, they can be repaired with a small amount of Metal Fragments. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240701/motorbike_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240703/motorbike_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240703/sidecar_01.jpg BICYCLES Bicycles can now be found across the map on roadsides, and also at several monuments. The standard bike takes one player, but a three-wheeled variant allows a second player to sit and shoot from the rear. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240701/bicyles_riding_01.jpg The bicycles aren't as fast or strong as the new motorbikes, but they're easier to acquire, and they don't use any fuel. Instead, they slowly consume your own food and water levels. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240701/trike_01.jpg Holding Sprint while biking will have the driver stand up and give you a bit more temporary power and speed. Sprint mode will also automatically engage if you're struggling up a hill. This feature wears out after a few seconds and needs time to recharge. HANDCUFFS AND PRISONER HOOD Take your enemies captive with the new Handcuff and Prisoner Hood items! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240625/handcuffs_prisonerhood_01.jpg Use the Handcuffs on a surrendering (friendly gesture) or downed player to take them prisoner - restricting their inventory, belt, use and interact options. Handcuffed players can be pushed around and forced into vehicles and other mountables. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240702/handcuffs_firstperson_01.jpg Place the new Prisoner Hood on your victim to block their vision and disable their map access, preventing them from seeing where you are taking them. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240703/prisoner_cuffed_01.jpg Handcuffed players can hold their attack button to progress the unlock minigame. Fill the progress bar and the Handcuffs break, releasing you! Unlock progress is tied to the Handcuff item condition so that you can always eventually get free - but being damaged or pushed will temporarily interrupt your breakout attempt! Additionally, performing the friendly gesture - at any time - lets other players inspect your full inventory and modify your belt - a great way to show you're not a threat or hiding something valuable! TRAVELLING VENDOR We've added a brand new event! The Travelling Vendor. The vendor will spawn naturally on maps with ring roads (4000+) and traverse the roads. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240702/vendor_roadside_01.jpg The vendor sells a selection of wares: from basic building materials to some of the best items in the game. Each time the vendor spawns a random selection of items are chosen to sell, along with a different price each time. If you're lucky, the vendor will decide to sell something at a discount, so keep an eye out! To get the vendor to stop just run up to it, but don't stand blocking its way for too long or you will be ignored. It can't wait on you forever! It doesn't take too kindly to gunfire or selling to hostiles so make sure you're on your best behaviour. I want to say a huge thanks to the Rust Discord Community for their incredible work in helping debug and improve the vendor. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Ceiling Light Wiring Ceiling lights IO points are now easier to target Improved Barricade Placement Can now place barricades on rocks and dirt roads DYNAMIC VENDOR PRICING To introduce a little more variety into the NPC vending system, this month we have introduced a change that increases or decreases the sale price of items purchased with scrap based on that item’s popularity. The way it works is we now keep a running total of the average number of items sold every 6 in-game hours. Every 6 hours if the number sold is less than the average then the price of the item will drop by 5% for the next 6 hours (down to a minimum of 50%). If the number of items sold has increased above the average then its price will be increased by 10% (to a maximum of 100% extra, or twice the price). We will be starting prices at 200% so they will likely drop for a while before settling to the “market” price. https://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/1b0311b1/dynamic_pricing_1.jpg An example of the logic: The average amount of SAM sites purchased in a 6 hour window is 150, and the current price has no increases or decreases. At the end of a 6 hour window we check and see that 155 SAM sites have been purchased. Since the average has gone up, we raise the price by 10%. Since the price is now more expensive, sales drop to 120 over the next 6 hours. Since this is below the average we then drop the price by 5%, which results in a 5% price increase in total. You can see the current discount and price when looking at an item on the map or in-person, the price displayed is the final price and there’s a small indicator that communicates what the current price change is and what that item’s initial price was. You can easily tell at a glance what items are cheap and what items are expensive, as well as how much they’ve changed price to make informed purchasing decisions. We’ve only applied this to sales where the currency paid is scrap - vending machines that offer scrap in exchange for items (fish market, resource exchange, etc) are unaffected. This will also not apply to player created vending machines. Why are we making this change? We believe the NPC vending meta can be shaken up a bit and this seems like a fairer change than us just arbitrarily changing a bunch of prices across the board. This way the prices will increase and decrease based on player behaviour and will vary from server to server. As usual we’ll monitor how this goes over the next month and make changes as necessary. FURTHER MEMORY IMPROVEMENTS Building on last month's work to reduce the overall number of objects in Rust to save memory, this month we are rolling out even more improvements. We applied the same principle (reducing the number of objects by combining them when possible) but at the project level, so that most assets are already combined and streamlined in the build and don’t need to be processed when starting the game up. The streamlining process we use here is even more aggressive and results in even greater memory savings while also reducing time spent processing assets. As well as these optimisations, we’re going to be making last month's renderer improvements now enabled by default. We believe this approach combined with last month's improvements has resulted in about a gigabyte of reduced memory usage on a fresh server. This was a huge effort as it involved manually modifying hundreds of assets across the entire game. Thanks to the valiant efforts of our QA team we’ve identified many cases where slight unintentional material and colour changes occurred but it’s possible some more snuck through into the release so please let us know if you see anything that looks incorrect! Just like last month, we have more improvements in the pipeline for next month including memory improvements to monument foliage and a new process for loading monuments that will hopefully reduce loading times and further reduce memory usage. UNDERWATER VISIBILITY Underwater visibility has been messed up for a while now. It was an unintended consequence of us rewriting the way we shade things underwater, to make it more flexible. That low visibility has now been fixed, but we might continue to tweak it some more in subsequent patches. ANTI-CHEAT UPDATE Since our last anti-cheat update back in April, we have banned an additional 65,181 accounts, 10,297 of these were temporary, and the remaining 54,884 were permanent bans. Here's the breakdown per patch: June - Seismic Shift: 14,949 permanent bans 5,898 temporary bans (86.39% of which were automated) 117,554 reports May - Meta Madness: 19,876 permanent bans 2,755 temporary bans (91.80% of which were automated), 111,094 reports April - Waves of Change: 20,059 permanent bans 1,644 temporary bans (94.67% of which were automated) 96,473 reports NOTES Patch-specific report data is only from Facepunch Official servers due to data reliability originating from non-official servers, the total number of reports across all server since April is 3,645,165. Bans that were later reverted are excluded from these metrics. Bans are placed for multiple reasons. The numbers above do not strictly reflect only cheat-related bans, but cheat-related bans make up the vast majority of bans. A single player can receive multiple bans, for example, if a user is temporarily banned and then later switched to a permanent ban, this is counted as 2 bans in the above metrics. Over the last 31-days, we've had 1,751,457 unique players, and close to half a million daily active players. Using the metrics above, it could be interpreted that 1.2% of the player base are cheaters, it's very common for cheaters to use many accounts over the course of the month. Cheaters often receive an account suspension, get another account, receive another ban, rinse and repeat inflating the true number. The above is to provide context and transparency, not to state we're doing a good job, there is much more to be done in this area, and we are continuing to work on it. NEXT In the last anti-cheat blog update, I discussed how we've limited the information cheaters can read and abuse from network data, such as knowing players health and buried stash locations, authorization lists from turrets and tool cupboards. The holy grail would be not networking nearby players and items you can't see. If a player is behind a hill and you can't see them, don't network the player. If a tool cupboard is inside a base, don't network the tool cupboard. This is server occlusion, and it's difficult to get perfect. We're currently experimenting with this and hope to do a slow rollout over the coming months, pending further internal testing. Additionally, we're currently working on many experimental features to disrupt cheats, some of these changes are nearly completion and will be deployed Soon™. Last month, we teamed up with a third party to handle takedowns on our behalf. One of the core objectives is aimed at cheat-related material. The takedowns will be made at the request of Facepunch staff after manual review. There is no automation, and there is no room for innocent content to be taken down. In the past 30 days, we've taken down over 300 cheats-related media on social platforms We're working on several other legal fronts, which are too early to discuss The next anticheat update will be in November CREATIVE MODE Creative mode is a new set of native tools Paddy and I have added which allows players to freely build, place and experiment without needing additional plugins. You can enable creative mode for everyone on your server using the server convar \"creative.allUsers\" or enable it just for a specific player using “creative.toggleCreativeModeUser PLAYERNAME”. Once enabled, there are several convars you can enable which overrides standard build and placement restrictions: creative.freeRepair - allows resource free repairs and bypass the repair cooldown creative.freeBuild - makes all building blocks free and adds the option to spawn blocks in a specific grade. Also allows the Hammer to upgrade and downgrade blocks for free. creative.freePlacement - removes most placement restrictions when deploying objects. Will allow building in building blocked zones, in other TC zones and when intersecting other objects. creative.unlimitedIO - allows an unlimited amount of line points and raises the distance limit when wiring IO entities to 200m. Also adds an invisible colour option in the colour wheel. This was originally made to help our Media team more efficiently build and film content, but we also see this being helpful for QA purposes as well. Hopefully you find it helpful too!

You can configure its range from 1 to 30 meters (one foundation = 3 meters) It will output a different power value depending on the type of explosion detected A non-exhaustive list of power values from explosives: 1 power = F1 Grenade, Beancan 2 power = Explosive ammo, Satchel 3 power = C4, Rocket The idea is to let you detect and trigger circuits when you're being raided. Alarms, traps... the possibilities are infinite, we're excited to see what you will come up with! BARRICADE PLACEMENT Traditionally, we blocked all forms of building inside Monuments. This made sense back in the day when Monuments were small in size and number, but over the years, the amount of land they take up has increased significantly. We want to reward players who pick a strategic location during a fight, but it's hard to pick a good location when you're in an empty field! This is why barricades can now be placed on the terrain around Monuments. This allows you to take cover as you enter and exit monuments, as well as take cover inside the open fields inside Monuments. Applies to: Wood barricade Stone barricade Concrete barricade Sandbags Remember: Monument Structures, Concrete, and Roads still block barricades at this time. Decay and melee protection has been adjusted to account for more relaxed placement 15 minute decay 8-10 hits with melee SEE DEPLOY GUIDE OF TEAMMATES Behold the ability to see what your teammate is placing and where it will be placed! This should clear up the exact location your teammate(s) are shouting while trying to build. By default, it only will show your teammate's deploy guides when you are building.

You will now see a red outline around the edge of monuments. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240604/monument_buildblock_supermarket.jpg This can be toggled in the options menu. Server owners can disable it via a convar if conflicts with custom Monuments. Monument building radius We also took the opportunity to adjust the building blocked size of some Monuments.

It's purely visual, it doesn't change anything gameplay-wise, and it also works with hoses and Christmas lights! PAINTING IMPROVEMENTS I worked on a bunch of improvements for sign painting this month based on community feedback. There's a mix of QoL and bug fixes, but they should all improve your painting experience! Changes Made the painting UI follow your UI scale option Added a convar to switch which side the painting UI is on (paint.leftsided) Increased the maximum brush size to 100 (was 32) Fixed brush sizes below 2 drawing nothing sometimes Fixed drawn brushes overlapping within the same stroke Fixed weird color blending behavior for the softest brush Fixed portrait and landscape frames using an incorrect aspect ratio paint texture (no more squishing and export inconsistency) This makes painting behave more like other apps Fixes low opacity values not actually actually being low because the brushes overlap ELECTRICITY QOL Medium battery size Reduced medium battery size by ~15%, now fits under half walls Tesla Coil & Igniter healing Tesla Coils and Igniters are now healed by your tool cupboard overtime Electrical Furnace Now automatically turned ON or OFF depending on whether they have power SAM Site Added a new input to switch your SAM Site targeting mode using electricity Solar Panel Solar panels no longer take conditional damage when picked up Wiring near vehicles Vehicles no longer prevent you from wiring components FISHING CHANGES We’re making several fishing changes this month to try and shake up the broader fishing meta. Our current issue is that it’s quite trivial to endlessly produce fish from a safe zone, then converting that fish to scrap. It’s not the fastest way to earn scrap but it is pretty reliable. Our intention with the range of fish available to catch was always that you would work your way up the chain - catch a sardine, use that to catch a trout, use that to catch a shark. By allowing raw fish meat to be used as a bait you could easily gut one fish and catch dozens more fish with that meat, which could then be converted into even more fish. To break this loop, this month raw fish meat is now only worth 0.5 bait (and can be used in stacks of 3) - whole fish can (and should) be used as bait but you now run the risk of losing that fish when casting out. The idea is to introduce a risk/reward mechanic. Do you cash out with your current trout catch or do you put them on line and go for the sharks? https://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/1b3111b1/fish1.jpg To balance out this reduction in bait, we’ve made several other forms of bait more useful. Several bait types can now be “stacked” - if a fish requires 5 bait to be caught and you stack two Worms worth 2.5 each, you can now catch that fish. This behaviour is applied across worms, grubs, berries and small fish, making these baits more viable. We’ve also increased the bait value of human meat (1 -> 3), bear meat (5 -> 10) and wolf meat (5-> 10). The stack amount can be seen next to the bait value when selecting the item in your inventory. The Survival Fish Trap became a bit neglected after we introduced the Fishing Rod, so this month we’ve adjusted it to make it more relevant. The trap now uses the same underlying fish/bait system as the rod, meaning you can catch different fish in different water sources as well as catch better fish based on the bait provided. The only mechanical difference between these two fish sources is that the trap cannot catch the same fish as it has used as bait and the trap has a 50% chance to lose the bait without catching the fish. TECH TREE COMBINING In order to save some space in bases, I’ve modified the Tech Tree menu to now allow you to browse and unlock techs from lower Tech Trees (eg. Access T1 techs from a T2 bench, access T1 and T2 trees from a T3 bench). Use the tabs in the top left of the screen to switch between available tech trees. The workbench tax from last month's update is applied based on the Tech Tree level, so there will be no scrap cost changes as a result of this change. The tech tree also now opens immediately when accessing the workbench, saving you a click. RENDERER MEMORY SAVINGS In hack week this month, I explored ways to reduce our memory usage, an area that is a real priority for us this year. While a lot of my experiments weren’t workable, one did actually end up saving several hundred megabytes of memory for very little cost, so it’s shipping as disabled by default this month. A renderer in this case is simply a thing that is visible to the player - a crate, a rock, part of a structure, etc. Importantly for performance each renderer has LODs (Level of Detail) - lower quality versions of each renderer that we switch to based on the distance to the players perspective. In Unity each of these LODs typically lives on a child object of a master parent object, so Barrel01 will have a child Barrel01_LOD0, Barrel01_LOD1, etc that we switch to. What I discovered during hack week is that in a proc gen map of 4.5k size, we can have upwards of 1.3 million objects in the world, each of these objects has some overhead (we need to store its position, rotation, what the object does, etc). In a renderers case, for every single renderer we had 3-5 child objects, one for each LOD level. I realised that in most cases each LOD object was just sharing a duplicate of all the information except for a different model, so I modified the system to detect when this happens and consolidate all needed information into a single object, then delete the child objects. By applying this to every renderer in the world, I was able to delete 385 thousand objects from the world, which had a combined memory saving of 484mb - pretty significant! This combination process is run every time the game is launched, we’re currently working on a change to make most of these modifications before we build the game, which should yield further savings next month. Due to how risky this change is (deleting 385 thousand objects has had some unintended side effects that we’ve now fixed), we’re shipping this new feature off by default, but we’ll monitor it’s usage through the month and likely turn it on by default sometime next month. The convar is graphics.collapseRendererLOD and you’ll need to restart your game after turning it on or off. Let us know how it goes for you! tldr: 400k less objects 500mb less RAM HORSE IMPROVEMENTS It would be amiss to say horses have not had their share of issues over the last few months. So following community feedback I looked into a solution that would resolve the difficulties players have had with horse navigation. Alongside some minor adjustments to prevent horses from getting stuck and preventing unnecessary stamina depletion, I introduced the ability for horses to walk backwards. This seemed like the most logical approach to alleviate horses getting stuck and should be an overall improvement to navigation. CINEMATIC ENTITIES I've added a few more cinematic entities this month for Rust creators to use in their video and image projects. These can be spawned by server owners/admins and can be hidden via console with pre-assigned group numbers. The new additions include: More spot and point light (red/blue/green variants) Unlit backdrops and cyc walls (green/blue/black/white/grey variants) Flags/cutters (small/medium/large variants) https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240606/cinematicentities.jpg Visibility Commands Cinematic entities assigned to different groups which allows them to hidden if desired. Use the command cinematicentity.hideobjects followed by group numbers to hide them. Cinematic entities are now assigned to specific group numbers which allows them to be hidden if desired. Use the command cinematicentity.hideobjects followed by one or more group numbers to set their visibility to hidden. The groups are setup like so: 0 = nothing (makes all entities visible) 1 = lighting 2 = backdrops 3 = props 4 = misc (flags/cutters) You can hide one or multiple groups in the same command line - for example: cinematicentity.hideobjects 1 - Hides lighting only (keeps light effect but hides the mesh) cinematicentity.hideobjects 1 2 - Hides both lighting and backdrop meshes cinematicentity.hideobjects 0 - Shows/un-hides all cinematic entities You can also hide cinematic entity groups in demos with cinematicentity.demohideobjects followed by the same group numbers above. To revert to the visiblity of the entities back to their original states from the demo recording, use cinematicentity.removedemooverride TWITCH DROPS Join us for the Bellum Redemption event June 10th-17th!

Turret interference will now be shown while holding a wire tool and looking at a turret. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/OHVgmTUjvRYIUL9j/mN2KF4USXcBeSoYQ.png It will also be shown in the hotbar while building. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/PK0KSOsp0ATe00ck/OjJYB1ItRs5NKLRr.png While this is accurate most of the time keep in mind this only counts turrets you are authed on (it ignores enemy turrets). This mismatch is required to prevent players from holding a turret and seeing how many turrets are inside an enemy's base. FULL DEVBLOG HERE",

        "contents": "AIMCONE REDUCTION Any movement in rust would modify your baseline Aimcone so that shots taken while in motion were somewhat inaccurate. This was supposed to discourage \"running and gunning\". The problem with this is that *any* kind of motion while in a firefight puts you at a disadvantage (minor dodging) and increases the amount of RNG experienced by the player. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220601/pvp_raid_05.jpg What I've done is reduced this penalty to zero to start, and blend it up to the full amount after 4 rapid fire shots. This means is you can now strafe and dodge while tap firing and not experience a huge aiming penalty, however full auto will be penalized. I've also adjusted the Aimcone curve modifiers for a few weapons so that more shots have a higher probability of landing closer to the center. This has been applied to the Custom SMG, SAP and LR300. WEAPON + ATTACHMENT UPDATES Weapon mods have received some love this month. BURST MOD The duration between bursts while using the burst mod has been significantly reduced to 2x firerate instead of 3x firerate. HOLOSIGHT The holosight mesh has had its edges thinned so that less of your vision is obscured while using it. This is a stopgap until we produce a new model for it. I've also fixed the Holosight reticle being affected by motion blur. MUZZLE BRAKE & BOOST Both the muzzle brake and muzzle boost have had their negatives reduced, they now have less damage reduction and less damage falloff and should prove to be far more useful. LR300 TWEAKS In addition, I've made some changes to the recoil, damage fall off, bullet velocity, and burst mode of the LR300. This should now be the best in class AR. Everything subject to change. SAFEZONE RECYCLERS Starting today, Recyclers in safezones have been nerfed. Their cycle time has been increased to 8 seconds and they now yield 80% of what they used to. This is the price you now must pay for safety. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240502/rust_recyclers_safezone_01.jpg However, the recyclers found at monuments have the same cycle time as before but now yield 120%! This is to reward players taking the risk out in the open. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240502/rust_recyclers_radtown_01.jpg While I am aware that a great many keyboards may be smashed as the death screen fades in over the droning hum of the active recycler, I still have hope this helps usher in a new era of roaming and monument combat. SALE SALE SALE! Some great items were not used because they were way too expensive. To that end I've made the following changes: HV Ammo - Gunpowder cost reduced significantly, and the yield per craft increased to match non HV ammo. Torpedos - Craft yield increased from 3 to 5. Incendiary Rockets - The cost has been drastically reduced and their damage + flame spread increased. Drones - Tech trash is no longer a requirement for drones. HMLMG - Gear cost has been reduced. EXTERNAL STRUCTURE CHANGES Large External Gates and Walls now require the player to stand still for 1.5 seconds when placing, making them less useful for immediate PvP encounters in the wild. We felt that being able to place down such large structures in a short amount of time felt at odds with our style of combat that rewards situational awareness and environmental tactics. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240501/rust_highexternalwall_deploy.jpg WOODEN BARRICADE RESIZE https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0111b1/rust_woodenbarricade_cover_double.jpg To fill the void left by the external wall changes regarding dynamic cover during PvP, we have doubled the size of the deployable wooden barricade. The wooden barricade remains instantly deployable and provides a moderate amount of cover on-demand without being overpowered or polluting the landscape with large, unsightly deployable. This is without a doubt a large shift to PvP, we'll be monitoring these changes carefully BRADLEY CHANGES Some further tweaks to the Bradley this month. Scientists now spawn in stages, based on the Bradley's health, and there's some Heavy scientists thrown in the mix now, too. At 80% health, 2 scientists will spawn At 60% health, 4 more will spawn At 40% health, 6 final scientists will spawn https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240405/bradleyscientists_01.jpg There's also been some tweaks to make some of the Scientists more aggressive and use varying attack angles. DOOR CONTROLLER You can now use door controllers without worrying about raiders abusing them to open your doors! This is accomplished by unpairing door controllers once your TC is destroyed & requiring code lock authorization for pairing. They also are much easier to setup as they can now be placed just like code locks. This should reduce the pain of constantly opening and closing the doors of your base... especially when your teammates tend to leave them open. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240502/rust_doorcontroller_wiring.jpg Now deployable on doors like code locks Automatically paired when placed Added 2 new side inputs : 'Open' and 'Close' Unpaired when the associated tool cupboard is destroyed We also carried on improving electricity by adjusting components and fixing various bugs this month. Thanks again to the community for reporting bugs and suggesting ideas. The full change log of each component can be read in the section at the bottom of the blog. PATROL HELICOPTER CHANGES We know the latest helicopter changes had some mixed feedback, so we've revised them. No go zones should feel a lot more fair, and most major bugs experienced with heli since the last update are now patched. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/patrolhelicopter_trainyard_01.jpg Monument Crashing - the helicopter will now attempt to crash at a nearby monument on death. It won't crash at monuments with safe zones: outpost, fishing village, etc. This can be disabled by server owners via: patrolhelicopterai.monument_crashing Flee Behavior - heli would previously flee when it sometimes didn't mean to. Damage to start a flee has been tweaked, ensuring a flee every time you quickly remove 30% of its overall HP. Numerous Fixes & Improvements - heli will now properly target you on boats, cargo, trains and other moving entities. Targeting fixes and performance improvements have been made throughout the code. More legacy bugs: such as heli not exploding immediately on impact with certain terrain are also fixed. LAUNCH SITE LOOT The Launch site loot had received an overhaul. Before, the loot inside the main building shared the same respawn group as the rest of the launch site, meaning loot inside the main building was never guaranteed. Loot had a chance to spawn elsewhere at the monument, which felt discouraging when completing the puzzle and running the main building. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240502/rust_launchsite_loot_01.jpg The main site building now has a dedicated respawn group, which guarantees 23 loot crates when the puzzle resets. Additionally, more loot now spawns throughout the monument. UNDERWATER IMPROVEMENTS Underwater vision has been improved substantially. You can now see much farther when using goggles and even more so when viewing out a submarine porthole. In addition, the surface accuracy of submarine torpedoes has been vastly improved and torpedoes were made cheaper to produce by way of an increased craft yield. Lastly, the duo submarine fires torpedoes slightly faster than the solo. BUILDING QOL Tool Cupboard Auth Friend Can authorize other players on a tool cupbard Demolish High Walls Can demolish high walls & gates for 10min after placement Fixed High Wall Snapping Hold SHIFT to disable snapping Foundation Placement Fixed foundation placement under roofs & floors Foundation Debris Foundations now drop debris Floor Debris Floors now drop debris TECH TREE CHANGES We’re making some changes to how the Tech Tree works to try and incentivise new styles of play. Starting this month you will notice that the T2 and T3 workbench tech trees now have a tax rate applied to them which will increase the cost of unlocking items. We’re starting this at 10% for T2 and 20% for T3. This cost increase only applies to unlocking via the Tech Tree, researching items via the Research Table is unchanged. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/workbenches.jpg Our thinking behind this is that we feel the Tech Tree progression path has become a little stale and needs to be shaken up, but we don’t want to lose the advantages that the Tech Tree brought to progression - making difficult to find blueprints attainable in a way that felt fair and not as at the mercy of RNG. While there are a number of avenues we can use to try and make both forms of progression feel more balanced this feels like a simple and understandable starting point. As with all of our changes we’ll be closing a close eye on this and will likely make further changes in the future. CARGO SHIP CHANGES It’s been great to see the reception to last month's Cargo Ship/harbor update, we hope you’ve all enjoyed some very (very) intense firefights. Based on the feedback we received we’re making a couple of changes this month: The Cargo Ship will now dock at both harbors (if they exist) on a map before leaving. Note that any containers that have already been placed on a ship will be deleted when it starts its approach to the next harbor. You can now mouse over the ship on the map to see if it has already docked. The containers that are spawned to be placed on the Cargo Ship will now be spawned when it starts its approach (about 100m away from the harbor) rather than when the ship arrives at its dock, giving you more time to hide in the containers. The container spawn points have been mildly tweaked so that all of the containers should be accessible, although you might need to do some climbing. We hope these changes make the event a bit more understandable at a glance as well as make the combat encounters more interesting. VIEWMODEL RENDERERS Since implementing a dedicated viewmodel renderer system back in April 2021, all of our viewmodels have been split between the old and new system. The primary stumbling blocks were viewmodels with lots of particle effects and lights (torches, flamethrowers, etc). While we covered most of the high impact cases of viewmodel jittering by supporting guns (how often do you use the birthday cake on oil rig?) we’ve been wanting to consolidate everything for a while. This month we’ve updated all of the viewmodels to use the new renderer so they should appear smooth and jitter free regardless of where you are in the world. The affected viewmodels: Both flamethrowers Water Bucket Beancan Grenade Molotov Cocktail Flashlight Birthday Cake Garry’s Mod Toolgun Poker playing cards Lunar New Year spear Minigun Paddle You should see no visible changes if it's all working correctly. AI PERFORMANCE FIXES I've investigated and addressed a couple of AI performance issues that were causing the AI to take longer to process than necessary, especially on servers that have been running for a while. This should help with AI server performance across the board. EFFECTS PERFORMANCE After noticing occasional framedrops during gunfights, I've spent some time investigating the issue and found out that our impact effects prefab warmup wasn't working as intended. All impact effects are now warmed up correctly during loading times. This should drastically reduce the stuttering when spawning a big amount of effects prefab for the first time (e.g when a fight starts and bullets start flying). This has a very little if no impact on loading times. MAP UPLOADING Procedural maps are now automatically uploaded from game servers to our backend so players can just download them instead of generating them when they first join the server. This should significantly reduce the time it takes to join a server for the first time after it wipes. It may also reduce the number of players seeing \"Rust is not responding\" popups while joining servers for the first time. HARMONY 2 Harmony is Rust's built-in modding platform shipped with the server. It powers modding frameworks like Oxide & Carbon, as well as standalone mods. We upgraded from Harmony 1.2 -> Harmony 2.3 which brings us up to date with the latest features & additional stability. This requires mod authors to recompile their Harmony mods. Fortunately the majority of mods only need to change a single line. Before using Harmony; After using HarmonyLib; Players shouldn't need to worry as the majority of large servers already started updating their mods before the update went live. Server owners please keep an eye out for mod updates as every Harmony Mod will needed to be updated.

        "contents": "CARGO SHIP DOCKING We’ve given both Harbors a fresh coat of paint this month, with a significant amount of visual and gameplay changes. These changes support the new Cargo Ship docking process, which allows the ship to adjust it's course and dock with the harbor. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_06.jpg Each harbor has a new island that can be reached by crossing a rotating bridge, floating containers or a daring set of jumps across cranes. This island becomes a stronghold once the Cargo Ship docks as it becomes sheltered from the rest of the harbor. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_08.jpg The ship will pick the first harbor it passes to dock and will only dock once. Once docked, the cranes in the Harbor will spring into life and move several containers from the docks onto the deck of the ship. These containers have openable doors and can be hidden in, so they present a new way to smuggle aboard the ship and another threat for players already on the ship to contend with. These containers will be deposited in locations that are generally above the deck, in some cases by several meters. This should present an interesting tactical situation when attacking the ship as well as defending it. We’ve also added two ship doors above the water line that allow access to the lower interior level of the ship and provide additional ways to board or traverse the monument while the ship is docked. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_10.jpg By default the Cargo Ship replenishes it's loot every 10 minutes - up to 3 times. When the ship docks at the harbor it will attempt to trigger one of those loot refreshes, although if all three have already happened it will be unable to spawn any more loot. The Cargo Ship horn will sound 60 seconds prior to it's departure - once you hear that horn it's time to get moving or you might end up back out at sea. We think these changes combined will lead to Cargo Ship being a much more contested PvP environment for groups of all sizes. We're also interested to see how a traditionally lower intensity monument like the Harbors adjust to periodic bouts of high intensity action. OILRIGS The Oilrigs receive an upgrade this month, with an underwater access. This new way to get onto the Oilrig will add a path into both structures Level 3 floors. This provides a different, and possibly safer way into the monument. It is also a way to counter the players on board by short circuiting the docks at the rigs water line. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_04.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_06.jpg The extra rooms inside see the addition of a CCTV desk that allows you to observe in place the camera feeds of the monument. MINIGUN The iconic minigun has been added to the game which is used by the Heavy Scientists. It takes a moment to spin up, but when it does, it unleashes a massive amount of ammunition, making targets much easier to hit. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240405/minigun_oilrig.jpg It's a rare drop useable by players and you must be at a workbench level 2 to add ammunition to it as it cannot be reloaded in the field. It also takes 1.5 seconds to spin up and lowers your movement speed while the spin is engaged. RETRO TOOL CUPBOARD We're thrilled to announce Rust's first-ever tool cupboard DLC skin! The Retro Tool Cupboard can be crafted as usual using the skin picker or applied to an existing Tool Cupboard using the Spray can item. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_01_alt1.jpg The Retro Tool Cupboard monitors display live information such as upkeep time, resources, and the number of blocks used to calculate upkeep costs. However, the data is only visible on the monitors when authorized. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_08.jpg The Retro Tool cupboard doesn't require power, the lower half of the Retro Tool Cupboard behind the glass panel displays current inventory upkeep amounts and tools. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_02.jpg When approaching the Retro Tool cupboard design, we felt aesthetics were critical. The tool cupboard is the heart of any base and should be instantly recognizable. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_10_alt1.jpg You can purchase Retro Tool cupboard skin in-game or at Steam's item store. MILITARY FLAMETHROWER In addition to the minigun, the Heavy Scientists have had their arsenal upgraded with a new, military tier flamethrower. This weapon deals massive damage to targets up to 12 meters away and creates walls of fire - which can be used for area denial. https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0311b1/Unity_pvGuUT044U.jpg I've also modified how flamethrowers deal damage to players making them an extremely effective PvP weapon. PATROL HELICOPTER IMPROVEMENTS The patrol helicopter was one of the largest banks of 'older' code still in the game. It's stood up well, but there were a bunch of fixes and improvements that needed to happen. Let's start with the improvements. Orbital Strafing/Strafing Changes The regular helicopter attack strafe was getting pretty old. It followed a regular pattern and most of our values were fixed internally. This has been changed. During an attack run the helicopter will randomise a bunch of values, including: rocket amount, drop off distance, turn speed etc. These are relatively minor adjustments, but they should help make each new fight with the helicopter feel a little more fresh. We also added a new attack phase in the strafing run. The helicopter will turn, begin orbiting your position and pummel you with rockets from all directions. This will randomly happen after each strafe. It's super fun to play, and helps bring back the excitement and danger of taking heli. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/patrolhelicopter_trainyard_01.jpg Aggro Improvements A new 'zones' feature has been introduced. These are invisible to the player. When a player damages heli a zone is updated/created and the zone is assigned a score. This score is based on how much damage heli has taken from that specific zone. Heli will now seek out targets based on zones and damage scores rather than the perceived randomness of before. When there are minimal players and by extension - minimal zones. Heli will work similarly to before, but when more zones are introduced heli will prioritise attacking the people that are attacking it, in a more controlled and deliberate manner. You are still free pickings to the side gunners, but your house shouldn't be blasted anymore in the confusion. No-Go Zones When taking heli, the basic principle is to get, and keep aggro. No-Go zones make this a little more difficult, and now encourage some movement when taking heli. When a zone performs enough damage to heli too quickly, then that zone is marked as a no-go zone. Heli will flee the area, and attempt to avoid it as best as it can. This is to encourage heli to get out of areas that are going to kill it too quickly. Encouraging bigger groups to chase, build defenses as they go and bring more PVP to the whole map. Bug Fixes/Changes A bunch of legacy bugs that existed with heli are now patched. These include being stuck on targets, disappearing mid-fight, not exploding in the ocean, as well as a bunch of proxy issues that were fixed by the aggro adjustments. Other adjustments have also been made to how heli patrols work, and you should see it moving around a bit more now, rather than just sticking to the monuments. Server Convars patrolhelicopterai.use_danger_zones - this will enable/disable the no go and aggro zones. When turned off, the helicopter will largely behave the way it used to with target picking and aggression. patrolhelicopterai.flee_damage_percentage - this sets the required percentage of damage done to heli in order for it to flee and create a no-go zone. A value of 1 or over will effectively disable no go zones and stop the flee mechanic. It will no doubt need some further revisions and changes after this release. Keep us updated on how your heli takes go. Have fun! ELECTRICITY This month we are taking care of our fellow electricians! Bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and major changes are coming to electricity. CHANGES First of all, we removed any power requirements from all logic gates. Being creative and adding logic to your circuits won't be at the expense of acquiring a linear or exponential amount of power any more. While being a great quality of life for master electricians, we also believe that removing this pain point will increase the use of electricity in general. https://files.facepunch.com/Flavien/2024/04/elec_comps.png Therefore, the following components won't require power or drain batteries anymore: Splitter Electrical Branch Blocker Root Combiner Memory Cell RAND Switch XOR Switch AND Switch OR Switch Timer Switch Smart Switch Counter Pressure Pad Button Any other active components like turrets, sensors, lights, etc.. remain unchanged and will still need power to function. BUG FIXES These power limitations were also overly amplified by a multitude of power drain bugs and unintended behaviors that we worked on fixing. Here are the most important ones: Fixed AND, & OR gates draining batteries on both sides instead of only the side with the highest power input Fixed auxiliary inputs/outputs draining power unnecessarily Fixed memory cell draining battery on both sides instead of from the active output Prevent electrical branch from draining power when nothing is connected to its branch out side Fixed unpowered components draining batteries, much more common now that branches do not waste power anymore QUALITY OF LIFE Along these changes, we worked on improving how you deploy electrical components: Fixed the differences between the deploy guide and the actual position where your component is placed Components are now aligned to walls and won't rotate based on your view angle You can now align your components together when deploying them on walls by holding left shift This applies to all electricity, industrial and fluid items. We're planning on extending it to any type of deployable in the future. NEXT STEPS There as more fixes and improvements that didn't make it into this patch. Expect more in the coming months, including plans to rework some components and extending their functionalities. Many thanks to our electricians community for pointing out bugs and suggesting ideas.

Over the past couple of months, we have slowly eliminated or limiting information leaks which cheaters abuse to aid them in several ways. For example, players health, Tool Cupboards and turret authorization lists could be read in the network data, allowing cheaters to use and gain a further unfair advantage. These are now fixed. In continuing efforts to battle cheaters and clean up many long-standing issues, especially around information leaks, buried stashes are no longer networked, meaning cheaters will no longer know where stashes are buried. There is much more to be done in this area, and we are working on it. Expanding the support team size over the past year has allowed us to get more support staff focusing on anti-cheat, which includes going in-game and dealing with and disrupting cheaters directly based on player reports. Some staff over the coming months will be dedicated solely to anti-cheat measures full-time. This isn't limited to Facepunch servers, but across the board. In addition to the above, we've deployed some stricter measures surrounding anti-cheating, eliminated several priority exploits, and will deploy further measures soon. In the last month: 26,954 bans have been applied 22,542 of which were permanent 4,412 of which were temporary 949,422 cheating reports received 90.8% of bans were applied automatically Since the 1st January 2024: 84,753 bans have been applied 71,371 of which were permanent 13,382 of which were temporary 3,116,133 cheating reports received 92.9% of bans were applied automatically Based on fiscal quarters: 72,849 bans applied in 2023 Q1 65,608 bans applied in 2023 Q2 81,682 bans applied in 2023 Q3 55,672 bans applied in 2023 Q4 81,084 bans applied in 2024 Q1 Notes Bans are placed for multiple reasons, the numbers above do not strictly reflect only cheat-related bans, but cheat-related bans do make up the vast majority of bans. A single player can receive multiple bans, for example, if a user is temporarily banned and then later switched to a permanent ban, this is counted as 2 bans in the above metrics. BRADLEY SCIENTISTS The Bradley has some new passengers this month! Scientists can now deploy from the Bradley to help defend it with some extra firepower. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240405/bradleyscientists_01.jpg This applies to both the Launch Site Bradley and the Bradley that spawns along roads at the end of the month. IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Seed Sack World Model Added new seed world model Mushroom World Model Added mushroom world model Monument CCTV Station New dedicated CCTV station within monuments SRV DNS SUPPORT I added support for SRV DNS record to Rust. This means you can now create nice domain names for your servers without needing to specify the port (or be forced into the default port). I also used this added information to improve the favorites list. Servers that have a working DNS record set up would save the domain name when favoriting so that favorites should never break as long as the domain name is pointing to the right place. More information on how to set this up is on the wiki. PING ESTIMATION If you have searched for new servers in the browser you probably noticed the large amount of fake ping: it's impossible to have 30ms ping to both a US and EU server. This is a side effect of certain forms of DDOS protection and has forced us to create a custom system to estimate ping rather than use steam's ping value. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/Oq1zIOPb3DPBpoQV/KqDt7UAGyQz5R0oT.png There is a new checkbox below \"Use Cache\" called \"Estimate Ping\". We will enable this by default in the future once we confirm the estimated values are more accurate than the existing ones. FULL BLOG POST",

        "contents": "TUTORIAL ISLAND https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0711b1/rust_tutorial_island_001.jpg A common story we hear from new players is that they have seen their friends/Twitch Streamer/YouTuber playing Rust, so they pick up the game and then bounce off it due to how harsh and unforgiving the new player experience can be. This month’s Tutorial Island is our attempt to provide new players with a safe environment to learn the basic controls and mechanics of Rust before being set loose in the main game with other players. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/rust_tutorial_island_gameplay_003.jpg?1 Everyone will be prompted to start the tutorial when they first spawn this month, if you’re a long term player feel free to decline the tutorial and we won’t ask you about it again. Once the player starts the Tutorial, they will be respawned on a dedicated island where an NPC will guide them through the first half hour of gameplay. This island is tightly controlled and cannot be reached by other players. Throughout this process players will learn some key concepts: Basic movement Crafting Building bases Upgrading bases Respawning Basic combat Resources Looting containers Cooking Using Furnaces Workbenches Using a vehicle This obviously isn’t an exhaustive list of everything there is to learn in Rust, but we feel like this is a good starting point for a new player. Our guiding principle when designing this sequence has been - if a player emulates exactly what they did on the Tutorial Island once they get into the main game, will they have a fighting chance? https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/rust_tutorial_island_gameplay_010.jpg?1 https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/rust_tutorial_island_gameplay_021.jpg?1 The tutorial itself should take less than 30 minutes if you’re familiar with general FPS controls and concepts, likely around an hour if you are not a regular FPS player. Once complete you will be dropped off into the main game with the same resources as any other player - completing the Tutorial Island does not give you any advantages in regular gameplay. For server owners running mods that change core gameplay features, you may find that parts of the tutorial don’t work or maybe showing the tutorial isn’t appropriate for your server (minigame servers for instance). You can control whether the tutorial is active via the “server.tutorialEnabled” convar - it's false by default. While false players won't be prompted to start the tutorial on your server and they will not be able to manually start the tutorial. We’ve added a server tag to help players find and filter servers by their tutorial compatibility, add “tut” to your server tags to advertise your tutorial compatibility. Brand new players will have this filter on when they first use the server browser. VENDOR UI REFRESH Our outdated tooltip popup for checking vendor stock urgently needed an upgrade. It felt out of place when compared with the marketplace UI. Thus, a plan was devised to merge both into a single unified system. This update will be rolled out in two parts, with this being part one. This first part fully replaces the old blue tooltip popup with an interface that's clearer, more user-friendly, and scalable. Now, it's easy to understand what you're purchasing and how much is costs. Overall, this first pass on the vendor UI provides a great foundation to expand on. New Single Vendor Interface Items are now displayed clearly with the cost and stock counts easily visible. https://files.facepunch.com/ianhenderson/1b0711b1/RustClient_Mfw0L7f6KT.jpg New Multi Vendor Interface Accordions are used to hold vendors with large amounts of listings. This keeps everything easy to read, whilst still giving users flexibility to add a bunch of listings. https://files.facepunch.com/ianhenderson/1b0711b1/RustClient_pEu65yL25G.jpg While working on this, we noticed some QOL issues with finding items before purchasing. The marketplace offers useful features like search and filtering that the standard map doesn't have. It would be great to have these abilities everywhere. Part two will unify the marketplace UI with the new vendor UI. You will still have to travel to the marketplace to buy things via drone, but the actual underlying UI will be merged together. This will provide the same search/filtering functionalities as enjoyed at the marketplace to the regular map vendor UI, whilst bringing the improved style and ease of use of this new vendor UI to the marketplace. NIGHTLIGHT Today, I'm addressing an issue we often hear about from the Rust community. Navigating the game during nighttime. While the night cycle is a cruicial element of the rust gameplay loop, it can be a literal stumbling block not seeing what's directly ahead. The problem of \"gamma hacking\" (where players unfairly enhance their night vision by tweaking monitor settings), has been a thorn in our side, necessitating a pitch-black darkness (RGB 0,0,0) to counteract such exploits. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/nightlight_002.jpg?1 To that end I've come up with the \"Nightlight\" feature. Basically it's a shader that subtly illuminates a small radius around the player, mimicking the effect of natural moon light. This localized lighting ensures that while you can see just enough to navigate at night, the vast darkness beyond remains dark. Distant pixels are kept at absolute darkness (RGB 0,0,0), effectively rendering gamma hacking useless for spotting far-off threats or resources. ( beyond a few meters) https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/nightlight_003.jpg?1 We believe this approach strikes a good balance, enhancing the night experience without compromising fair play. I hope it helps! IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Rangefinder Rangefinder added to binoculars Attack Helicopter Flare Attack helicopter flares now take 30 seconds to reload Safe Metal Detecting Metal detectors no longer able to find loot in safezones Attire Conflict Visual feedback when switching attire conflict ITEM STORE UI UPDATE This month, we’ve made improvements to the store interface. These changes are part of a UI overhaul for the menu screen that we’re currently working through. One of the main improvements is adding in a custom view for each of the general store items, giving a better look at what an item looks like or what is contained within a pack. For example, the Abyss pack, we now show a cut-down version of the trailer, the items contained within the pack in a 3D turntable, media and a bit of information about the pack. These changes are aimed at improving the experience of using the store, more transparency in regards to what you’re potentially purchasing, and improving it from a visual point of view too. Store Interface Re-designed view, with improvements in regards to scaling and legibility of the items. https://files.facepunch.com/lewis/1b0411b1/20240304111711_1.jpg?1 Store Item Model We've improved the interface for the model that appears when you tap on an item. A new key addition being an animated 3D version of the skin. https://files.facepunch.com/lewis/1b0411b1/20240304111729_1.jpg?1 General Store Model We've added a new view for each general store item. Some of these include cut-down trailers, items contained within as a 3D turntable as well as media and general information about the item. These new views hopefully give a better understanding of what you're getting in the purchase. https://files.facepunch.com/lewis/1b0411b1/20240304112341_1.jpg?1 https://files.facepunch.com/lewis/1b0411b1/20240304120833_1.jpg?1 HAPIS & OBSERVER ISLAND RETIREMENT Hapis Island and Observer Island custom maps are being retired today from Facepunch servers. Observer Island was first released in November by community members CollapsedOrange and wheatleymf and Hapis Island was brought back to celebrate 10 years of Rust. If you're a server owner and wish to host your own Hapis or Observer Island, you can check them out at the following links: Observer Island - Lone Design Hapis Island - Lone design What's the future for custom maps?

This month, we're excited to bring you the small and large backpack, allowing players to carry more loot. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240129/rust_backpacks_hero_01.jpg Inventory space has become more scarce as more items have been added to Rust over the years. Small Backpack https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240131/rust_backpacks_04.jpg The small handmade backpack provides 12 slots & can be crafted for 50 cloth and five sewing kits at a T1 workbench. It is a default blueprint and will take 30 seconds to craft. Large Backback https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240131/rust_backpacks_06.jpg The military-grade backpack carries a whopping 28 storage slots and is uncraftable, found in military loot. How To Use Both are worn in the backpack slot and drop off your character on death. They can be looted on the ground (be careful if dropping one in a safe zone!) or from inside your own inventory. They take 3 seconds to pickup off the ground and despawn slower when filled with valuable items (up to 2 hours). Currently, there are no negative effects from using a backpack. NEW PLAYER REMAINS BACKPACK To help differentiate regular player remains from the new backpack models we’ve given the player remains a visual refresh. This new model has a new open and closed visual state so you can tell at a glance if a bag has been opened by anyone. There is also some visual debris around an opened bag if the bag has more than 3 items in it. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240129/rust_playerdeathremains_01.jpg METAL DETECTOR The new metal detector allows you to find metal objects hidden beneath the ground. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240130/rust_metaldetector_01.jpg Use the green lights to find the general area of an object, then when the green lights are all fully lit, hold the right mouse button to start sweeping the ground more closely and illuminate the yellow lights. When all the yellow lights are also lit up, a flag will be placed. Dig this flag up with any melee tool and grab your treasure! Different areas of the world will yield different types of loot, for example, what you may find on the beach will be different than what you find at the roadside or fields. WEAPON CHANGES I've modified the animations for the SAP/SAR and they should feel a bit less floaty and more snappy when reloading and aiming. I've also reduced the additional recoil added while moving when using the SAP. Over the coming months I plan to take a look at each and every weapon and do another pass at balancing them. This means timings, handling, recoil, and aimcone. I'm not saying the changes will be drastic but I'm aware there are elements that need changing. Stay tuned. IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Legacy Shelter Limit Players can now only have one shelter placed at any one time Safezone Warning When attempting to log out in a safe zone a warning now appears Compass Death Marker Death marker now appears on the compass UI Repair Cost Fix Some deployables such as the autoturret were unintentionally expensive to repair, this is now fixed. Rotate Doors Doors, hatches and embrasures can now be rotated while being deployed using R Ripe Ripeness Increased all plants ripe stage duration from 4h to 14h MILDER SCREEN POST PROCESSING A recurring community comment is the on-screen hurt, cold, warm and radioactive post-processing is hash, it impacts the screen too much. To address the comments we have made the post-processing more mild. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/02/2024/7r18/side%20by%20side%201-min%281%29.png https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/02/2024/6701/side%20by%20side%202-min.png Above are a few examples, you can find more here. REDUCING SERVER SIDE ENTITY COUNTS As mentioned in our start of the year blog post, memory usage is a key area of concern this year. One aspect I’ve been looking at lately is entity counts. Anything that gets networked in a Rust server is an entity, so every tree, building block, player, vehicle, etc. What might seem counterintuitive is that many Items in your inventory are also entities, specifically an entity we call a Planner. This is the blue sheet your player visually equips when they are deploying something (eg. a sleeping bag). Any Item that can be deployed in your inventory will have a corresponding Planner entity. This entity is created when the item is created, and will exist on the server (typically in the players hands or at the world origin if they are in a container) until that item is used or destroyed. We need this entity as it handles all the logistics of spawning the deployed version of the item. To illustrate how many entities this creates we looked a list of entities on Facepunch EU2 towards the end of the November wipe last year. Out of 362,299 entities, 32,455 of them were Planners and are the largest count of entity (the next largest was Walls at 26,015). Since Planners are technically only needed when the player has the item equipped on their belt, this is a big waste of memory and processing time as well as needlessly bloating server save files. This month we’ve rolled out a change that will only spawn a Planner for these Items once the Item is in a players inventory, then delete the entity when it is moved back into an inventory. This should dramatically cut down on the number of entities taking up memory for no real reason. We also applied this change to Syringes and Bandages, specifically because these item types also don’t need an Entity if they aren’t in the players inventory and are often stored in large quantities (5,769 and 1,206 respectively in the above EU2 sample). Syringes in particular have been a performance bottleneck for the Industrial system due to the need to create and destroy an Entity every time the item is moved, so this change should have flow on server performance improvements there as well. We think this change should reduce entity counts on the server by roughly 6-9% but we’ll be monitoring the results over time. INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE We received reports from several servers this month with Industrial performance issues. After investigating we found some extremely complex conveyor systems moving large amounts of Syringes as the culprit. The above changes to Entity counts will largely solve the issue, but I’ve also added a new convar (Server.industrialTransferStrictTimeLimits) to better handle time budgeting in these situations. While the Industrial system is time budgeted per frame (eg. Only process three conveyors per frame) it struggled if one conveyor took an excessive amount of time (eg. One conveyor takes 15x the allocated budget). This new convar will allow the conveyor system to stop half way through a transfer if it is taking too long. Crucially it will then resume the transfer from where it left off on the next tick, so the final results should be the same, they may just take longer in real time. From the players perspective, this may result in conveyors splitting things in unintuitive ways (eg. a conveyor splitting into three boxes might do 2 on the first tick, then the last one on the last tick) but it should eventually produce the same result. Therefore we’d recommend turning this on selectively if a server is experiencing Industrial performance issues. As well as this new convar some general performance optimisations were made, so things should be a little faster across the board in the Industrial system. MEMORY OPTIMIZATIONS Despite having some guards in place, asset memory can easily run ouf of control. We keep adding awesome new content and, unfortunately, it keeps increasing our memory footprint. In order to be able to sustain this rate of content expansion, memory usage has to be low and stable, regardless of world complexity. Until we can implement more aggressive and effective streaming, every once in a while we have to sit down and look at what we missed and make the necessary corrections. On this update we nuked almost 3 GB of memory usage in shader assets, plus a few hundred MB on textures and meshes. This is a bit of a soft start, in regards to textures and meshes, but we expect to reduce memory usge by a few more gigabytes in the coming months. We do care about memory and performance, and we're actively working on it. This is just the first stage of many that will target not only improve memory usage but also frame rate. IMPROVED TEXTURE QUALITY Modern games universally depend on asset compression to maximize the efficient utilization of available system memory. To justify the efforts invested in compression, developers often turn to lossy techniques, which, particularly in the realm of textures, frequently lead to a compromise in image quality. Rust was long overdue for a texture quality review. Below is a before and after. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/130/01/2024/5T31/texture_quality.jpg The improvement in detail and color fidelity can be striking in some cases (right). This is an ugly texture but it's a good example of how compression can ruin a high frequency image. Regions of pixels get merged together and color shifts slightly (left). Texture compression was being used quite aggressively and, after tweaking some settings, we were able to significantly improve image quality without sacrificing memory. In the end, because a lot of textures had untapped potential for savings, we actually ended up saving runtime memory, at the cost of disk space, while still improving overall image quality. TEAM MARKERS WITH NV GOGGLES These were quite mis-aligned while wearing NV Goggles, especially near the screen edges, where they would sometimes float above seemingly nothing. This has now been fixed. IMPROVED DOOR/GATE VEHICLE BEHAVIOR Doors and Gates have been cancelling their open/close animation when hitting a vehicle since Modular Cars were introduced, however that would sometimes lead to cases where the animation cancelling would crush vehicles if they hit the Door/Gate from the opposite side. This has been improved this month and colliding with an animated Door/Gate in the direction that it is moving will no longer cause the animation to cancel. This should lead to less cars getting crushed.",

        "contents": "10 YEARS OF RUST Servers are now wiped and Santa is packing up and clearing out the bodies, but we hope you enjoyed the Holiday Season. We're getting back to work after a couple of weeks off, which is why this blog is lighter than usual, but we're looking forward to the journey ahead in 2024! This year, we celebrated Rust's 10th Birthday, which has been an incredible journey. Rust is continuing to see year-on-year growth and for a 10 year old game, that's a rather impressive feat. At a glance, here are some key gameplay features we added in 2023: Industrial system Drones RF Detonated C4 Security Camera Player controlled turrets Pings Double horse saddle Missile silo monument Wipe event Building skins Sleeping bag limits Building upgrade effects Water refresh Tugboat Ferry Terminal monument Wounded info Chat emoji Attack helicopter Homing missile launcher Parachutes Armored hot-air balloon Above and below rail linking Underground train signals M4 shotgun Alongside a metric ton of improvements. Rust continues to be a labour of love from all of us at Facepunch, and we couldn't have done it without your passion and feedback. Rust has evolved around player feedback. It's not the game we initially set out to develop, but it's a game we're incredibly proud and passionate about to keep developing. Thank you for being an integral part of this incredible journey, we look forward to delivering updates for the years to come. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/01/2024/8X88/A_1M5fjc.jpeg If you're interested in learning more about Rust's history or a further look back at 2023, you can view the timeline here: https://rust.facepunch.com/rust10 MOVING FORWARD What can you expect from us in 2024? More of the same! Guaranteed monthly updates every first Thursday of the month, along with frequent fixes, quality of life changes, improvements and holiday events. Next Month On February 1st, we'll release the backpack update. Backpacks will be a new craftable attire, allowing the player to carry more items. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/01/2024/2h12/RustClient_5ddZwDq1tL.jpg Can't wait till February? Backpacks will be publicly playable on Staging next week, allowing everyone to test and give feedback. Next month we'll also limit the number of shelters players can have placed at any one time. Forwards We have a ton of content currently in development, and if you're keeping an eye on our commits page, you'll already know some of them. This year, you can expect to see new and revamped monuments such as the compound, a tutorial system for new players, motorcycles, revamped server listings UI, new weapons. A hot topic we see is improving the world and the environment. We have multiple patches lined up in 2024 to improve the world, creating unique buildable areas such as canyons and lakes and improving rivers. Procedurally generated caves, additionally, we'll be exploring and improving cliffs and rock formations. We also plan to address the defender's advantage of sea-based monuments and events like the cargo ship. We are to rework the harbours, and the cargoship will soon dock with the harbours. Outlined above is skimming the surface of only a few key features. We have a lot more planned. But what about? Performance? Performance is always an ongoing process. We're constantly adding and improving new features monthly, often hidden in changelogs. There is no magic button to increase performance. Instead, it is a slow process of small gains. Our immediate attention is on bringing memory usage down, which can provide a more stable and consistent FPS experience for some users. We've already got several improvements ready for internal testing and hopefully release in the coming month or two. This year, we'll be bringing onboard new hires with a strong focus on performance. We'll continue to share news on performance in our monthly development blogs. Global Rendering? We first announced Global networked bases in September. Global rendering aimed to reduce bases popping in, significantly increase the view distance of player structures and reduce some performance overhead when rendering bases. Immediately we ran into some issues, applied fixes, re-released, and ran into further problems, this process repeated a few times and then went into development limbo. It was clear to us that we pushed this out too soon, with a lack of internal testing. We're making time over the next two months to thoroughly test and evaluate global rendering with the hope of releasing it publically again in March. Pets? If you follow our public commits page, you'll know we worked on pets for several months and suddenly stopped. For several reasons, we halted this project, and it will not be released this year. Our goal is still to have pets in Rust, but we have several obstacles to overcome first. We're currently hiring a game AI programmer to join the Rust team to help improve our AI and eventually assist in pets development. Nexus? Again, if you follow our public commits, you'll have seen the Nexus system. What is the Nexus system? In short, the Nexus system allows us to cluster servers together and enable players to travel from server to server to server using flight and boats, effectively linking an unlimited amount of servers, creating an environment where you can interact with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of players and explore multiple maps without the need to move servers permanently. Nexus opens many doors to us, for example, dedicated arctic maps and maps with advanced AI and high-yielding resource maps but with a dangerous environment. We don't plan for Nexus to replace the current existing server format as you play currently, but rather an optional new way to play Rust if you wish if you choose to do so. We plan to release Nexus in 2024 when ready, but much work is still ahead of us. Night times? Another hot topic within the community, for years between 2015-2019, we experimented with brighter nights. Whatever we tried, we saw many players using third-party tools to gamma boost to see at night and gain an unfair advantage over other players. It's a complex issue to address, if we increase light levels at night, we'll reopen old lessons which we know did not work in the past. Night time acts as a natural time for players to take a break, craft, build or use the cover of darkness to move loot or harvest resources, we want to retain this and allow players to use darkness to their advantage with the use of night vision and light sources. We do agree that being unable to see entirely at night and unable to navigate around is not a good or fun experience, and we plan to revisit the subject early this year. The aim of the change is to allow players to navigate around at night more easily, if you want to PvP at night, then flashlights and night vision are still a must-have. Anti-cheat? A hugely complex topic. We work closely with Epic Games' Easy Anti-cheat, to aid in detecting and banning cheaters in Rust. We don't disclose what we do and don't do when it comes to anti-cheat for good reason. The more information we disclose publicly, the more it can assist cheaters and cheat developers to circumvent measures, it's a huge cat-and-mouse game. One of the best anti-cheat measures is obscurity. The fewer people know what EAC and we are doing, the better. This comes with the drawback of not communicating enough, on the outside, it appears we're doing nothing. Almost every month, we're shipping improvements or fixing/restricting cheat features. We've fixed several high-priority exploits upon discovery or disclosure within hours through hotfixes we don't note publicly. EAC sometimes pushes several improvements weekly, which are applied when you start the game. Our promise to you is we're actively monitoring and combating cheaters daily. Our internal systems keep improving, as do EAC. Last year, we overdoubled our support team to aid in player support issues, which included anti-cheat matters. This year we're dedicating more resources into anti cheat than ever and exploring some more radical measures. Old Content? We've set aside multiple months in our internal roadmap of light or no content. These gaps are deliberate to allow us to be versatile and adaptive to community feedback, time to focus and address old content, and improve recent content. We have a lot we can keep building upon, not all content we add to Rust is supposed to become meta, but rather adding yet another way of achieving a goal. At a quick glance, here are just some of the changes ahead: Older monument reworks and improvements Continue experimenting and making meta changes to gunplay Softcore game mode Improvements Hardcore game mode experimenting Experimenting with progression Improvements to AI Improvements to events such as the patrol helicopter, Launch site APC and Cargoship World environment Underwater exploration Missions Using our data analytics to identify less commonly used items and balancing Experimenting with new ways/events to encourage players to engage with PvP IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Ragdolls Improvements Several server-side ragdolls improvements and fixes following last months changes Map Focus Hotkey Pressing F now focuses the players position when the map is open Scrolling Item Descriptions Long item descriptions now scroll TRUST IN RUST - TWITCH DROPS We're excited to announce that hJune has teamed up with Rustoria again for the next Trust in Rust tournament on Saturday, January 13th.

Rust and its DLC packs are currently on sale till the end of January with up to 50% off. The Christmas Event is once again live! If you haven't been around for this before, here's what you can expect: Every once in a while you will hear the sound of jingle bells. Run outside and look for a gift! Two gifts are spawned per player, in a radius of about 40m from where you are standing. Run up and bash it open to receive your Christmas presents. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. If you have enough small presents stashed, you can \"trade up\" to a medium or large. The contents of each present vary, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and candy. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_giftboxes.jpg Once again, you will be able to find Santa hats and reindeer antlers, both of which can be worn and provide a decent amount of protection. There’s also a lickable candy cane club, and two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring the stocking will fill up with loot. The larger stocking has a higher chance for better items and both last around 5-10 refills. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_santasleigh.jpg The advent calendar is a craftable deployable available to everyone during the Christmas event.

        "contents": "RUST 10TH ANNIVERSARY This month marks Rust's 10th birthday. We’ll celebrate from today till the 16th of December with in-game birthday cake, hats, throwbacks and some new items. Rust has undergone significant evolution since its launch in 2013. It initially began within the Unity Engine 4, playable in a web browser. Later, a standalone version launched on Steam early access, the beginning of which is now known to most as Rust Legacy. With rocky foundations, a complete overhaul was done to what we have today, known as Rust reboot, or just Rust nowadays. Over the past ten years, Rust has sold over 16 million copies (not counting console). Rust Legacy 2013 https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/106/12/2023/8j73/59dc97fe534c22706b625619cb2ec6867553d321.jpg Rust exceeded everyone's expectations and has grown yearly for ten years. We have delivered monthly updates for ten years straight, as we continue to expand the Rust development team, we have no plans to stop providing you with guaranteed monthly updates. Rust Reboot 2015 https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/107/12/2023/2n13/d20d177fe4242bcd178065a6c7bdb257f2b6c637.png Below are some exciting metrics we've achieved over the past 10 years. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/107/12/2023/6c20/Q8DexdRx.jpeg If you're interested in learning more about Rust's history, you can view the timeline here: https://rust.facepunch.com/rust10 On behalf of everyone at Facepunch Studios, we'd like to wish you a Happy Holidays. In the January end-of-years blog, we'll discuss how 2023 has gone, what we've achieved, what we learned, and our upcoming plans for 2024. PINATA Take your best shot at the new Pinata deployable, available to be crafted for 500 wood. Destroying the Pinata will drop a random selection of goodies, remember to share with your teammates. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231208/pinata_01_alt.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231208/pinata_02.jpg CONFETTI CANNON Mark the occasion with the Confetti Cannon! Simply light the fuse and sit back while the confetti rains down. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231208/confetticanon_01.jpg LEGACY WOOD SHELTER Remember those first few hours of Legacy Rust? Farming resources for your first big base, and needing a place to call home in the meantime? The shelter was the answer. Now it's back! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/legacyshelter_01.jpg The shelter comes with an included door, key lock and even a small radius of building privilege! The perfect start to your Rust journey. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/legacyshelter_03.jpg Shelters will decay naturally, provided the door isn't interacted with (by someone with a key or ownership of the shelter) at least once a day. Make sure you keep using your shelter in order to keep it! Shelters placed within a tool cupboard radius will use TC upkeep as normal. They can also be repaired with the hammer, the same as any other deployable. Hello! I'm Ian, the new Gameplay Programmer! I remember cowering in my shelter back in 2013 Rust. It's incredible knowing I'm giving new players the same experience I had back in the day by bringing Vincent's awesome model to life. I can't wait to bring you more in the future. LEGACY BOW DLC The legacy bow is a limited-time only store item which is only purchasable during the month of December. This bow skin pays homage to the first-ever bow model in Rust. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231207/legacybow_01.jpg LEGACY WOOD BUILDING SKIN Available now from the Rust store is the new Legacy Wood building skin, the first Wood building skin. Owning this skin will allow you to change the visuals of your wood tier base. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_01.jpg This skin is for sale at the Steam store. To use, simply equip your hammer tool, display the wheel, and enable building skins. This should reveal the skin's wheel on which you may choose Legacy Wood upgrade. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_15.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_04.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_12.jpg M4 SHOTGUN The M4 shotgun was first introduced way back in Rust Legacy in 2013. To celebrate 10 years of Rust, we've decided to revive it. The M4 is an uncraftable military-grade shotgun; unlike other shotguns, the M4 has a much stronger range attack. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231207/legacyshotgun_01.jpg The M4 shotgun is a rare drop in high-end loot crates. LEGACY FURNACE The Legacy Furnace is a free skin for the furnace based on the original model from 2013. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231207/legacyfurnace_01.jpg To earn the Legacy Furnace, simply play for 3+ hours during the month of December. The furnace will be automatically issued to your Steam Inventory to use! https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0611b1/Rust10_LegacyFurnace.png Fun Fact - The original furnace was made of starter rocks copied and pasted together in the shape of a furnace. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/107/12/2023/7s00/Legacy%20Furnace.jpg UPDATED PAINT UI The paint UI has been in need of an overhaul for a while and that's what it got this patch! Not only does it look way better than before, it also has a lot of new features and improvements. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/104/12/2023/0s19/kZkySWXVDk.png New features: Eraser tool for all types of signs Colour picker tool Made the brush size and opacity options sliders (instead of buttons) Added a brush spacing option as a slider Added a more natural looking paint brush Added two air brush types Button to reset the camera to face the object straight on Button to switch the preview lighting on or off (removes glare at some angles) Allow chatting while in the painting UI, with a button to hide it Bound Ctrl+S to the save button Added a button to download the image currently being edited to your desktop Now have bindable convars for controlling the tool and brush options while painting paint.selectedtool lets you set the current tool (as a number starting from 0, wrapping around at the end) paint.selectedbrush lets you set the current brush paint.brushsize sets the brush size slider paint.brushspacing sets the brush spacing slider paint.brushopacity sets the brush opacity slider Note: These function as convars so binds like \"bind L meta.add paint.selectedtool 1\" will switch to the next tool Note: You may need to re-open the paint UI after adding a bind when the paint UI is open Improvements: Fixed ugly UI, made it easier for us to maintain the three different types of paint UIs Added canvas scaler so UI isn't tiny at large resolutions Fixed gap visible between preview and right UI at some resolutions Clicks on top of UI will now never paint on the sign Added tooltips to all buttons so it is clear what they do Optimized 2D painting implementation so long, quick strokes don't kill framerate SHADOW INTENSITY POLISH The Contact Shadow option has been in the Experimental section for some years now. I believe the main reason for this is related to a very obvious over-darkening of Grass/Foliage shadows. Foliage materials have a shadow intensity option that allows artists to control penumbra darkness, making it a bit more realistic. Contact Shadows, basically, ignore that parameter. Last month, I decided to go over it and fix the problem, while tweaking and optimizing the effect in the process. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/106/12/2023/2871/contact-shadow-intensity.jpg It should now look a lot more seamless when toggling on/off, respecting shadow intensity while still grounding the grass. HAPIS ISLAND Continuing with the theme of throwbacks to celebrate Rust's 10th Birthday, you've asked, we've listened, Hapis Island is back.. again! This map version is community-made and based on the 2018 version. If there's one thing the Rust community doesn't lack, it is passion. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/107/12/2023/7J95/hapis_08.jpg We plan to host Hapis Island until March 2024. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/107/12/2023/6P51/hapis_04.jpg We're hosting two servers of Hapis Island across different regions. These can be found in the official server list by searching \"Hapis\" US - 54.39.130.95:28015 EU - 51.210.222.218:28015 IMPROVED RAGDOLL BEHAVIOUR Player ragdolls - the floppy state a player's body enters after being killed - have been revamped this month. They can now collide with all vehicles in the game (trains, cars, boats, helicopters etc), where previously they simply fell through. Issues with ragdolls stretching out unnaturally have also been eliminated. If you ever saw a corpse where the interaction wasn't lined up with the visible ragdoll, that's fixed too. Old Behaviour When a player died, a corpse entity used to spawn that was basically just a pelvis-sized collider, which was physically simulated on the server. The position of that \"corpse\" would sync with every client. On the client side, a separate \"ragdoll\" object would spawn, that was a whole visible person with a full set of physically simulated limbs. That ragdoll was attached to the server-side-simulated corpse basically by a tight spring. The corpse object controlled the actual loot interaction. Essentially the intention was: Let the client do the work of simulating a whole body. We don't really care how their arms and legs are positioned, on the server. If it's different between clients, also don't care. Keep the loot interaction consistent between clients by simulating just that part on the server. Keep the (client-side) ragdoll and the (server-side) corpse together with the spring. In reality, things were not perfect: If a player died somewhere like the top of a wall, the corpse might fall down but not the ragdoll, or vice versa. Since the collision setup was quite different between (server-side) corpse and (client-side) ragdoll - only the pelvis area matched - this was relatively common. The result would be a mismatched position between corpse and ragdoll, sometimes putting the interaction in a strange place. The client-side ragdoll joints really did not like working with the pelvis position data that was coming from the server. If movement was sudden, rather than just ending up in the wrong place, the ragdoll would sometimes stretch out unnaturally. If a ragdoll was on a moving vehicle, things were especially bad, to the point that we couldn't enable ragdoll collision with vehicles at all. Things would happen like a ragdoll dangling under a scrap heli because it had fallen out but the \"corpse\" hadn't. This was exacerbated by the fact that the client-side ragdoll physics simulation didn't work well with the fact that the vehicle was being moved on the server, rather than simulating on the client like the ragdoll was. Although the physics did work, they acted like the surface had zero friction, so the ragdoll would tend to slide around while the server-side corpse wanted to stay put - and the spring kept trying keep them together. New Behaviour My first instinct for the simplest fix was to try just locking the ragdoll to the corpse, rather than using a spring. That would force them to stay together. Unfortunately locking the pelvis to a position that was coming from the server, whilst simulating all the connected joints on the client, made the physics system very unhappy. Trying Unity tricks like using 'rigidbody.MovePosition' versus '.position', projection on or off, more solver iterations etc didn't really help. The limbs would really want to stay where they were while the pelvis pulled them around, and you'd just end up with a horrifying stretched-out ragdoll instead of one that was simply in the wrong place. Plus the limbs still had some of the old problems, like the zero-friction-on-vehicles issue. The pelvis also didn't always simulate well for a full body, since it didn't have any of the connected torso/legs/arms/head, so it'd try to go places the full body didn't want to go. The spring allowed for that kind of leeway, but a fixed connection didn't. So ragdoll-on-vehicle support was going to require either writing a custom physics solution for simulating the limbs on the client plus making something better for the pelvis simulation on the server side, or moving the whole ragdoll simulation to the server. Ultimately the custom physics solution was going to require most of the same work that a fully server-simulated ragdoll was, on top of being difficult to code on my own in a way that came out superior to what Unity has already managed with 7,700 employees. So server-side ragdolls was the winner. The new ragdolls work like this: A corpse spawns on the server, and that corpse is a fully simulated ragdoll with limbs etc. The base position of that corpse syncs to the client like it did before, but now the limbs also sync, in an efficient way that's packed into a couple of 32-bit integers. The client no longer has a ragdoll object that's separate from the corpse. The corpse is the ragdoll, and it's simulated only on the server. That basically eliminates all the problems at once, apart from the performance cost on the server of simulating more than it did before. To handle that, I've made sure that ragdolls stop simulating as soon as they've settled down, including when they're on a moving vehicle. Overall the performance cost on the server is low, and behaviour is much improved. Reverting If anything does go wrong, there is a new 'serversideragdolls` console command that can be set true or false. It's now true by default, but setting it to false will immediately revert to the old system. IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Industrial Pipe Colors Added teal, orange, pink & purple Sprinkler Water Fix Fix sprinklers wasting up to 40% of water (4 or 9 planters) Fixed Tugboat FPS Tugboats were rarely causing a large FPS drop when coming into range Car Lift Pickup The car lift can now be picked up when not in use Hot Air Balloon Fixed Players falling out of the hot air balloon Heli Crate Remodel Updated patrol heli crate Fixed Explosive Ammo Splash In some situations, explosive ammo was not correctly applying splash damage Square Sun Did you ever notice the sun was square sometimes? No? Well, it's fixed Controls Search Added a search box to the binds sections of the options menu Drone ID Drones now show their ID inside the player's inventory Ore Harvesting Ore collection tools now have a slightly further attack, no longer have to duck/crouch to harvest Bandage Revive You can now revive players by using a bandage on them, restoring a small amount of health OIL RIG RADIATION Exactly 1 year ago we increased the respawn delay of oil rigs from 30min -> 1 hour. We noticed something strange though... the monument was sometimes taking hours (plural!) to refresh. After looking into it we realized some players were staying on Oil Rig & blocking the respawn for a number of reasons; ranging from farming resources to siting afk in vents to grief the monument. Radiation will now appear on oil rig 30 minutes after the hacked crate unlocks. It will apply low but consistent radiation (regardless of what armor you are wearing) forcing players to leave oil rig after the event is over. We also resolved the issue of players leaving a single item inside the hacked crate to keep the crate's map marker on the map when it was \"empty\". To communicate this new change with radiation there are multiple danger indicators when it starts: https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/KeB0juo4XYzOPpFX/RustClient_jTBjsq2Zzq.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/dtPy32YkZGHloTBB/paintdotnet_j7Ql7GqyeM.jpg Note: that the alarm sound has changed what danger is signifies: it has changed from \"heavy scientists incoming\" to \"radiation starting\". These changes should ensure the Oil Rig event keeps refreshing & you always have loot to fight over. END OF YEAR RETIREMENTS As the year ends, we look back at what has and hasn't worked well, we have decided to make the following changes: Hardcore Hardcore was released in August 2022, a game mode aimed towards veteran players, with creature comforts such as safe zones, team systems and maps disabled. Since its release, hardcore has seen a declining player base, and we feel now is the right time to retire Hardcore from official servers. It was an exciting game mode for us to experiment with, but we missed the mark on its implementation. We have collected a lot of community feedback for if and when we choose to revamp this gamemode in 2024. Hardcore can still be enabled on community servers. Barren Barren was introduced as a map to cater for the low-end system and before the introduction of custom maps. We've made some advancements in performance since, regular community use of custom maps, and declined user base on Barren servers, we feel now is the right time to retire Barren. We also think Barren looks ugly and not a good representation of Rust. CHRISTMAS UPDATE On December 16th at 19:00GMT / 14:00 EST, we'll be releasing an optional server and client update to enable the Xmas event and some festive features! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_tree.jpg TWITCH SUPPORT A STREAMER Beginning December 7th till December 31st 2023 we will be hosting our very first Twitch - Support a Streamer Campaign! https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b2111b1/SaS-1280x720%20_%20Campaign%20Key%20Art.png During this period anyone that purchases 2 (two) subscriptions from any participating Rust Streamer will earn an exclusive Creator Computer Station to use in game!

I do believe this makes him the highest subscribed Rust channel to date? Please do correct me if I'm wrong. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b2211b1/bloox.png With his great achievement he's also created what he calls his \"magnum opus\". A nearly 4 hour masterpiece to commemorate the long road that got him here. Settle in, grab some popcorn, and give this man some of your time (and a thumbs up). Congratz Bloo, we're proud of you! COBALT - THE DESCENT Another long-time coming project SyntheticKill as been working on is out! Tons of cameos in this one including yours truly as the Exposition Commentator. Had a few hitches a long the way with ever-changing Rust development causing some delays in his cinematics but we got there! Is this how YOU saw Rust lore happening? FANCYORB'S GLOBAL WARFARE Alright so as many of you may know FancyOrb did a huge event this summer involving tons of creators and their pals to do a Global Warfare event. The map was a replica of earth in its entirety. Every region was battling to maintain control of their territory and take control of others. Blood was shed, politics were fierce, and treaties were undermined. This epic story FancyOrb narrated shows exactly how events unfolded. 300% worth the watch! This event will take place again next summer even bigger and better. Stay tuned! IF RUST WAS AN ACTION MOVIE Dyl Dip make this cute little action cinematic short! https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b2211b1/dylshort.png Is this where we call Vin Diesel? SHOW ME THE STUFF!

And we release monthly updates - without fail - delivering new content, lore, plus regular Twitch drops, and more. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/0edc63c615723535950f5eb51cf721b640e448ce.jpg We provide regular updates on our efforts to ensure the community are aware of what’s happening in game and behind the scenes - plus, we have brought in a range of new mechanics, skins, monuments, landscapes and graphical and gameplay improvements - with many of these also monitored and improved on post-release. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/0175bdbada57122c9dcd09e1c83c81938ddcd62a.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/16d13a319484896e13791c85ac7e4e36efffd7aa.jpg We listen to the Rust community and use their feedback to influence balancing and fixes that have encouraged all sorts of innovations within the game. Each month sees us constantly impressed by what the community can create and exploit. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/f97ec03d69e5374ecfdf4a29c4eb23e65700f576.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/0a1e608c32d4b72fce95b1c7c48fd0fd238aabee.png And looking at just the last 12 months, we’ve brought players tug boats, helicopters, drones, parachutes, train linking, decorative items, storage, and more. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/384509623d5de8e38e7dde5a7d1d75c89feab204.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/f6370914aeb9a33a036cb26748056534f4d62e04.jpg In the last 10 years, the game has undergone some huge changes, including graphic, physics, and engine updates and rebuilds, all because we’ve wanted to make Rust what it is, and what it could be.

        "contents": "ABOVE AND BELOW RAIL LINKING https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231102/railroadlink_01.jpg This month we are finally connecting the above-ground rail network with the underground. While playing on servers with a world size of at least 4250, you will find one or two rail tunnels allowing you to seamlessly travel between the underground and above-ground networks. To do it, simply take a train inside one of the tunnels, drive it down a short slope and you will be inside the underground network. All wagon types are fully compatible with both networks regardless of their length allowing for new gameplay opportunities. To top it off, we also made some visual tweaks to the network that fix light leaking issues in small areas like the stairwells, as well as made some other minor tweaks and fixes. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231102/railroadlink_03.jpg UNDERGROUND TRAIN SIGNALS https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231102/train_lightsignal_red.jpg For a while now we've had signal lights in the underground train tunnels, but they were always off. They're now fully functional and can be used to see what's up ahead. - A green light means the block is clear. - A red light means the block has something in it - a train or a barricade. - A yellow light means the next block has something in it, so you can get prepared. A \"block\" is the section between two train signals. If there's no next signal, it's the rest of the track, either to the end of the line or the next 500m if it's further than that to the end of the line. https://files.facepunch.com/BillB/1b0111b1/trainline_graphic.png WIRE TOOL RECONNECT Not only did we couple the rails this update: we also allowed you to re-couple your wires! If you have done electrical before, you know the pain of unequipping a wire tool and having to re-run the wire from the top to bottom of your base all over again. (or yelling for a teammate to place a root combiner quickly!) Short demonstration here. Note: If a teammate blocks industrial with a wall as you have your wire tool holstered it will resume right before the industrial pipe is blocked. We also added the ability to reconnect existing wires to avoid rerunning them through the base. This speeds up redesigning circuits and will make reconnecting long wires significantly easier. Use right click to reconnect, hold right click to disconnect & clear wire. ITEMS ON VEHICLES Dropped items no longer fall through vehicles. You can now drop items on trains, cars, boats, helicopters etc and they'll collide properly. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231102/vehicle_itemdrops_boat.jpg Dropped items do have some mass, so they can weigh vehicles down a bit if there are a lot of them. But you can still fly a scrap heli load of stuff across the map. FRONTIER BASE DECOR PACK New this month is the Frontier base decor pack DLC, a wild western-themed collection featuring ten new items and 17 variants. The pack can be bought from the Rust Steam item store or in-game. Fish Trophy Put your best catch on display for the world (or at least your teammates) with the Fish Trophy! Simply insert a fish to make it appear on the mount. Try interacting with the mounted fish to get a peek into the life of a fish in Rust. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_fishtrophy_01.jpg Hunting Trophy Caught something a bit too big for the Fish Trophy? The Small and Large Hunting Trophies allow you to stuff and mount the heads of your foes. To get started you’ll need to use the new Skinning Knife to harvest a corpse, this will result in a special Head item that can be mounted. The Large Trophy can display a Shark, Bear, Boar, Wolf, Polar Bear, Horse and Stag head. The Small Trophy can display either a Chicken or Humanoid head. When harvesting a player or NPC, the head clothing worn by that person will be displayed on the mounted trophy. Once a Trophy is mounted you can mount extra matching heads onto the stand, this will be tracked and displayed along with the name of the creature or player. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_huntingtrophy_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_huntingtrophy_05.jpg Wooden Frontier Bar Doors Make a stylish entrance with the Wooden Frontier Bar Doors. These can be installed into a Wall Frame and operate like a regular Double Door except your player opens the doors like a gunslinger walking into a saloon. You can also open the radial menu to access the kick option, giving you even more style when opening the doors. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_bardoors_01.jpg Wanted Poster Look your enemies in the eye, all the time, even in your own base with the Wanted Poster. You can interact with a deployed wanted poster to assign a player to it, this will put the players mugshot and name on the poster. You can select from any player in your contacts (any status) or from your friends list. The Wanted Poster comes with 3 additional skins with different styles and sizes. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_wantedposters_01.jpg Torch Holder Don’t throw out your starting Torch yet, now you can put it in this fancy holder to provide some quick illumination in your base. Once you insert a Torch you can interact with it to Ignite/Extinguish it and it will react to any nearby Igniters or sources of water (Water Buckets, Water Guns, Sprinklers, etc). The Torch Holder works the same with all Torch skins, even the Abyss Torch. A mounted lit Torch will decay at the same rate as it would if held in a player's hands and will break eventually. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231102/decordlc_torchholder_01.jpg Rocking Chair Had your fill of dull, lifeless chairs? Ditch the mundane and embrace the spirit of the frontier with the Rocking Chair. It's the quintessential piece for the player who appreciates both comfort and aesthetics. This chair marries practicality with a touch of rustic charm. Movable with your inputs, it's a remarkable blend of both function and form, ideal for your base. Just make sure you don't act like a gunslinger whilst seated! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_rockingchair_01.jpg Frontier Planters Now you can grow your crops in style! Whether you want to grow corn or hemp in a disused minecart, an abandoned bathtub or a hand-crafted rail road planter, the new planters will allow you to plant 2,3 and 9 of your favourite berry seeds. Give your hemp farms that wild western look with the new frontier planters! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_planter_minecart_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_planter_bathtub_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_planter_railroad_01.jpg Single Item Weapon Racks Short on space? The three new single item weapon racks let you mount and proudly display your favourite or most essential items. Place them somewhere convenient and easy to grab! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_singleweaponrack_01.jpg Storage Barrel Two new storage items, the vertical and horizontal storage barrels. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231101/decordlc_storagebarrel_01.jpg IMPROVEMENT FIXES & HIGHLIGHTS Water Catchers Water catchers now fill even faster following last months changes Jackhammer Repair The jackhammer can now be repaired inside the workbench for free Jackhammer Refill Jackhammer can now be refilled in the repair bench for free Planter Pickup Planters can now be picked up with a hammer Repair Bench Auto Skinning Autoskin items by holding shift while right clicking into repair bench Saddlebags Increased slots per horse saddlebag from 6 to 12 OBSERVER ISLAND Observer Island is a 4K-sized custom map created by community members CollapsedOrange and wheatleymf. Observer Island features custom mountains, road/train bridges, train tunnels, unique monuments, arch rocks, a unique map layout, and manually sculpted cliff formations. The goal of this map is to encompass all the elements of vanilla Rust while expanding upon them with new features, making map exploration more engaging. It also aims to refresh vanilla gameplay with new building locations, unique map layout, and various other enhancements, including some secrets. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/131/10/2023/2x05/observer-island-mapguide.png CollapsedOrange and wheatleymf dedicated time to experimenting with ideas frequently suggested by players for procedural maps. As you explore, you'll notice custom caves, mountains, large forest areas, several underwater monuments, and arch rocks that allow you to build inside them, just like in the old, simpler days. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/131/10/2023/8E78/2023-10-23-122858.normal.png In addition to the new map features, lots of effort has gone into building custom monuments. While some are relatively simple, others are far more complicated. They might even lead to a well-hidden secret monument… https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/131/10/2023/3r20/2023-10-19-012352.normal.nohud.png https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/131/10/2023/3i93/2023-10-23-122359.normal.png It’s worth mentioning that this is not “new Hapis”. But instead a unique map layout with its own features, so you can always come back to this map if you ever feel tired of procedural maps. We had fun making it, and we hope you will enjoy it too. Please let us know what you think about this map! Servers How to play? EU - connect 195.60.166.70:28020 US - connect 216.39.240.158:28015 For server owners, since this is a custom map made by the community, this map will be available for purchase from November 9th in the lone.design store. This will include a full map, related plugins and permanent access to all future updates.",

        "contents": "TURRET INTERFACING A common complaint we have been hearing for a very long time as the over-use and abuse of turrets. To combat this we've added \"Turret Interference\" Basically this means that only a certain amount of turrets (sentry.maxinterference) can be active in any particular area ( sentry.interferenceradius). subsequently activated turrets will emit a blue electrical glow and fail to acquire any targets. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/rc_auto_turret_01.jpg There is no hard limit on the number of turrets you can deploy, only a limit on the number of turrets to be activated at any one time within 40m. For example, you may choose to enable 12 of your outdoor turrets but keep your indoor turrets disabled or you can set up smart circuits to detect players and power up turrets when needed. Hopefully this addresses some of the concerns we've been hearing regarding this issue, and we plan to iterate and improve, we'll be watching the feedback. SMG BALANCE While SMGs are not intended to be used in long range engagements, some of the clips sent to us are a little out there. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/rust_mp5_table_1080p.jpg I've reduced the aimcone on SMGs slightly so that more rounds will land in the center during sustained fire. I've also given the MP5 a bit of a buff, it'll deal slightly more damage and have less bullet drop. The burst mode has also been improved, yielding higher accuracy and less recoil. QOL IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Updated TC Layout TC contents and tools are now one page with +1 tool slot Vehicle Dismount Settings Adjust how long it takes to dismount a vehicle per type (Ground/Air/Aquatic/Horse) Toggle Vending Machines Can now hide Vending Machines from the map view Bad Weather Higher chance of rain, storms and fog Water Catchers Water catchers now fill much faster when it rains, even faster in stormy weather Small Battery Small Battery now outputs more power and has a higher capacity Underwater Visibility Underwater is now slightly brighter Tug Boat Player Respawn Players are now unable to respawn on Tug boats if too close to water monuments Workbench Radius Workbench radius has been slightly increased, allowing crafting from further away BRUTALIST BUILDING SKIN Available now from the Rust store is the new brutalist building skin which allows you to change the visuals of your stone base. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/10/2023/9l99/brutalist_buildingskin_001.jpg This skin is for sale at the Steam store. To use, simply equip your hammer tool, display the wheel, and enable building skins. This should reveal the skin's wheel on which you may choose Brutalist upgrade. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/10/2023/5g55/brutalist_buildingskin_006.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/10/2023/8130/brutalist_buildingskin_004.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/10/2023/2Z52/brutalist_buildingskin_007.jpg HOMING MISSILE LAUNCHER SCOPE In the last update we released the Homing Missile Launcher, and some keen-eyed players probably noticed the sleek digital scope attached to it. We're now happy to announce that this scope is fully functional, and allows for a full ADS view as you doom your whirly-twirly foes. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/104/10/2023/7h69/RustClient_gAzoa7j1Nn.jpg UNITY 2021 LST SERVER UPDATE Last month, we rolled out a Unity engine update for the server. After prolonged monitoring, we're confident to say the upgrade has resolved several long-standing server crashes dating as far back as 2019. While most server crashes and stalls are resolved, we have identified another AI-related stall we're investigating. Overall, servers should now be more stable. GLOBAL NETWORKED BASES...AGAIN? Last month we launched Global Networked Bases as an experimental feature... and disabled it 4 hours into wipe. Despite monitoring for a week on staging, it still managed to DDOS servers and make bases invisible on certain hardware! Although all known issues have been resolved, this feature is still considered experimental and disabled by default. If you want to give it a whirl, look for \"Global Rendering\" in the options menu & remember to restart your game after enabling or disabling it! https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0511b1/1TqWCqVOEFiYjSTY.jpg CACHED BROWSER Tired of waiting 60+ sec for your favourite server to show up? Try enabling the \"Use Cache\" button & click \"Refresh\" to load all servers instantly! Note: although this should be an improvement over steam's server browser, it is still considered experimental and disabled by default. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/K0b23QSKAxOaTh6S/RustClient_asqhrIJLUp.jpg RUST INSIGHTS - SEPT 2023 Another monthly round-up of data that we've captured in the last 30 days.

        "contents": "ATTACK HELICOPTER https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/attackheli_airfield_01.jpg The Attack Helicopter is now available to purchase from the Air Wolf store at Bandit Camp for 2250 scrap. Gunner The main special feature of this helicopter is the gunner seat. On the front is a turret similar to the deployable autoturret, where you can equip a gun and ammo. At the side pods, rockets can be loaded in - HV and incendiary type only. The gunner can then aim and shoot both of these while a pilot flies the heli. Simply interact with the gunner monitor and start blasting! Fire1 will shoot the turret and Fire2 launches rockets. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230906/attackheli_gunner_monitor_01.jpg If the gunner has flares ready in his or her inventory belt, those can also be held and manually thrown to deflect any oncoming homing rockets from the new homing rocket launcher - this is a new feature for passengers in all Rust helicopter types, not just the attack helicopter. Pilot The pilot is the driver, but can also fire rockets (left mouse button by default), albeit without the handy exact-point-of-impact guide that the gunner gets. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230906/attackheli_rockets_01.jpg Standard flares can also be loaded into the rocket storage area along with rockets, and the pilot can fire them out (right mouse button). The attack helicopter is fast and powerful when armed, but it was still be taken down with a well-aimed rocket. HOMING MISSILE LAUNCHER The Homing Missile Launcher is a new craftable addition to your armoury that allows you to more efficiently fight flying targets while out and about. To get started simply load a Homing Missile into the Launcher and start aiming at a flying target. You’ll notice a lock-on bar will start filling in. Once locked on you can fire, but be sure to keep aiming at the target or the missile will fly off course. Changing weapon or reloading will also disrupt the targeting. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/homingrocketlauncher_01.jpg From a pilot's perspective, there are a few tools at your disposal to evade these new threats. You will hear a warning lock audio indicator in every helicopter when a missile is fired at you. The simplest tactic is just taking evasive manoeuvres - the missile lock requires a direct line of sight so getting something solid between you and the launcher should keep you safe. If that’s not possible, flares are your next best bet. Any passenger can throw Flares to disrupt any incoming missiles. The Attack Helicopter also has a dedicated Flare button that can launch flares via the secondary attack button (RMB by default). The NPC piloted Patrol Helicopter has also been upgraded with Flare functionality, it will automatically fire Flares when a missile is launched at it. The Homing Missile Launcher requires a Workbench Level 2 and can be crafted for 20 HQM, 3 Metal Pipes, 1 Tech Trash and 1 CCTV Camera. Homing Missiles require a Workbench Level 2, and two missiles can be crafted for 3 Metal Pipes, 200 Gun Powder and 1 Tech Trash. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230907/homingrocketlauncher_aim_01.jpg PARACHUTES https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/parachute_temp_03.jpg The parachute is a new craftable item that allows you to slow your fall from great heights, as well as travel silently over long distances. Once you’ve acquired one, you will need to equip it in the new dedicated backpack slot on your character’s clothing bar. Once equipped you’ll be able to press Space while falling through the air to deploy the parachute, slowing your descent and allowing you to manoeuvre your way through the sky. Your movement keys can help you manoeuvre while in mid-air, allowing you to tilt forwards to fly faster, back to slow down and left and right to turn. You can use weapons while flying, but doing so will prevent you from steering. Simply holster your weapon again to regain steering controls. Your flight can end either via you hitting something solid or cutting your lines with the Dismount key. After your flight an unpacked version of the parachute will drop in front of you, to use the parachute again you’ll need to hold the pickup key for 8 seconds to pick it up again. Each use will lower the condition of your parachute by 20% and a parachute will become harder to control as it loses condition. A damaged parachute will fall faster and fly forwards slower. At extreme damage levels you could still take fall damage when landing the parachute. If you hit something solid you can take damage based on your speed, up to 80HP at top speeds. The additional slot in your inventory has been added to the locker interface so you can store parachutes with loadout kits. Parachutes are a special new type of clothing that can be equipped alongside full-body clothing like Hazmats. Parachutes can be targeted by SAM sites, Auto Turrets and players on the ground while in mid-air. You can craft Parachutes at a Tier 2 Workbench for 2 Tarps, 2 Sewing Kits and 50 Cloth. ARMORED HOT HAIR BALLOON https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/armoredhab_wide_01.jpg The hot air balloon can now be upgraded with a new armor upgrade. Equipping the armor will boost the overall health of the balloon whilst also providing additional cover and protection. The new armor upgrade can be purchased at the Bandit Camp vehicle parts vendor. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/armoredhab_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/armoredhab_02.jpg GLOBAL NETWORKED BASES You normally only see bases ~300m away. Get ready: this feature cranks up the view distance of player structures up to 1500m away! In the past, SAM sites could appear out of nowhere, only becoming visible after the missiles are headed your way. You should now be able to spot SAM sites & enemy bases long before you come in range! This doesn't just benefit you in the air. While on the ground you can scout roof camping towers & big bases before you are in danger. You will notice the world feels much alive with evidence of player activity all around you. I know you're thinking \"Won't this cause performance issues?\". Well, turns out the new rendering system is significantly more efficient than unity's normal one. The majority of computation is on the GPU which allows us to keep performance parity while rendering 25x the amount of bases. This also sets the stage for additional performance improvements in the future. This feature is currently disabled by default as it required a lot of changes. Look for \"Global Rendering\" in the option menu to enable it. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0511b1/1TqWCqVOEFiYjSTY.jpg WEAPON RACKS https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/weaponracks_010.jpg The Weapons Rack Pack is now available from the Rust item store. Weapon racks introduce a quick, versatile and functional weapon and tool storage solution. With a Weapon Rack, you can efficiently organize, store and display your tools and weapons like a true survivor. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/weaponracks_anamorphic_010.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/weaponracks_anamorphic_018.jpg The weapons rack pack lets the player craft three different sized wall-mounted weapon racks and a single floor storage solution. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230904/weaponracks_005.jpg If you missed last month's community blog, check out the real-life Rust weapons rack. IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Pumpjack & Quarry Pumpjack & Quarry model have received a refresh Hot Air Balloon Fuel The Hot Air Balloon now uses slightly less fuel Furnace Skin Glow Furance glow was broken, it's now fixed and improved Fluid Switch & Pump The Fluid switch and Pump now stack in the inventory Non-learnable blueprints Improved UI to clearly feedback certain blueprints that cannot be learnt Hot Air Balloon Decay When hot air balloons become stuck, they'll decay much faster END OF THE WORLD When players drove vehicles to the edges of the world and went out of bounds, we killed the player and vehicles, This wasn't great as we gave no feedback for when this was about to happen. Now vehicles are unable to leave the map bounds - we now apply a force on the boat/aircraft, making it impossible to escape. Additionally, boats, if left unattended/idle for 2 hours, will begin to be forced back to shore gradually. WINDOWS 8.1 SUPPORT DISCONTINUED From October 28th, Rust will no longer support Windows 8.1. As technology continually evolves, so do our system requirements. In January 2024, Microsoft will officially discontinue Windows 8.1 support, no further security updates and software updates will be made available. We highly recommend that users currently running Windows 8.1 consider upgrading their operating system to a more recent version, such as Windows 10 or newer, to ensure optimal performance, security, and compatibility with future updates.

We have information on all kinds of things ranging from how much wood is harvested to what the most used gun is. Something we want to get better at is showcasing some of that data.

It will now tell you the probability of recovery as well as how many seconds are left until recovery/death. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230803/wounded_ui_update.jpg Remember: Maintaining full water and food will grant you a higher probability of recovery, and a large medkit in your belt will grant 100% chance of recovery. CHAT EMOJI https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0311b1/emoji.jpg Chat Emoji is a new feature this month that allows you to express yourself in some new ways. You can access the new list of emoji’s via the emoji button on the right of the chat. From there you can search for a specific emoji as well as change the current selected skin tone for all of your emoji’s. You can also type a : into the regular chat box and start typing to get an autocomplete that you can navigate with the arrow keys and Enter. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0311b1/emoji2.jpg In addition to the animated emoji’s you can also use the internal item name to create an emoji using the item icon (eg. :wood:). https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0311b1/emoji1.png Server owners can also create their own emoji's for use on their servers, placing 256px png or jpg images in the \"serveremoji\" folder in their root directory will automatically expose those emoji for use by players on the server. Emoji's are not currently compatible with chat in Rust+ although we’re planning on exploring this in the future. BRICK BUILDING SKIN Available now from the Rust store is the new brick-building skin which allows you to change the visuals of your stone base. This skin is for sale at the Steam store. To use, simply equip your hammer tool, display the wheel, enable building skins, this should reveal the skin's wheel on which you may choose brick style upgrade. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230731/buildingskin_brick_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230731/buildingskin_brick_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230731/buildingskin_brick_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230731/buildingskin_brick_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230731/buildingskin_brick_06.jpg IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Server Crash Loot Crafting queue items are no longer lost if a server unexpectedly shuts down World Models Stack Size Some world models now reflect the amount dropped. 57 Art Bug Fixes 57 Art Bug Fixes, see the change log for full details BURST MODULE IMPROVEMENTS Burst modules have been buffed.

Whether you're looking for some intense competitive PvP, a relaxed PvE sandbox, minigames, creative and build servers, or high-rate battlefield servers of the kind offered by Rust Academy, where you can get right into the action with minimal gathering. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust\">Rust</a> is one of the best <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival games</a> on PC. In its vanilla form, Rust is a gritty Darwinian sandbox in which you must scavenge to stay alive, developing your equipment from sticks and bows to M249 machine guns, keeping it all safe in bases of wood and rusty metal while other players seek to take it all from you. But as these servers amply demonstrate, it can be so much more than that. By tweaking all these particulars or adding new ones through mods and custom content, creative players host games that focus on the PvP aspects, or the building systems in a more peaceful environment, or create entirely new minigames with more restrictive but wildly inventive rule sets, and we've found them all. So whether you're a veteran looking for a challenge or a new player looking to navigate what can be one of the most intense online communities, we're sure you'll find a <strong>Rust server</strong> below where you'll feel at home. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/best-servers\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sequel-confirmed\">Rust 2 confirmed, but it \"definitely won't be a Unity game\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-auth-timeout\">Rust downtime \"beyond our control,\" developer tells Valve</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/may-update-nuclear-missile-silo\">Rust's May update sees the survival game go nuclear</a> ",

        "contents": "SLEEPING BAG LIMITS https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230530/sleepingbags_limit.jpg This month we’ve decided to limit the maximum number of respawn options to 15 per player. This is a big change and not one we make lightly, so we thought it would be a good idea to explain our thinking. While this is an inconvenience to certain playstyles, we believe adapting to this change will lead to a healthier and more interesting game. Back in October 2020 we revised the death screen, unintentionally making it trivial to manage a large number of bags. This led to situations where players could respawn rapidly and rejoin fights in ways that work against the goal of death being meaningful in Rust. Ultimately we want placing new respawn points to be an interesting decision rather than something done as often as possible. We explored alternatives such as adjusting the respawn radius on bags or grid based approaches. Unfortunately this was simple to bypass and too complicated to communicate to players. Increasing the cost of bags/beds wouldn’t have solved the issue as large groups could easily overcome any additional resource requirements. To help manage respawn options we have made them visible on the map while alive. We also added the ability to unclaim bags you aren't using anymore. There is a new toggle on the right side of the map (below the layer controls) to hide bags while alive. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0111b1/bags.jpg There are multiple ways to see how many bags/beds you have placed: a count on the icon as well as a notification after you place a bag/bed. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0111b1/limit.jpg To prevent malicious behavior (such as \"gifting\" bags to other players and filling up their quota) you will find a new “Bag Gifting” option in the options menu. This will allow you to limit who can assign a bag to you. The choices are: Anyone (default option) Team (teammates + friendly in contact system) Disabled (nobody allowed) https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230530/options_sleepingbags_gifting.jpg Server owners can change the maximum bags per server with the convar \"max_sleeping_bags\". If you would like to disable it for your server, set it to \"-1\". We will keep an eye on this change over the coming months and make changes as required. BUILD UPGRADE EFFECT To say that our building upgrade effect was dated would be an understatement. I don't think it has been adjusted since its inception. I've taken some time to improve the effect, and bring it in to this decade. When you upgrade a building block, you will see it constructed piece by piece over the course of one second. Short demonstration here. Keep in mind that this is a client-only effect and the upgrade still happens immediately on the server. You can also disable this effect in the options menu. In the future, we may expand this build-over-time effect into a feature, so that very large deployables, such as watchtowers don't just appear in one frame but rather will need to be built over time. IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Handmade Shotgun Ammo Added handmade shotgun ammo world model Vending Machine Debris Vending Machines now drop debris when destroyed, preventing replacement Pylon Fixes Fixed floaty pylon placement edge cases Building Skin Repair Fixed building block getting fully repaired when switching building skin Streamer Mode Skulls Harvested player skulls in streamer mode now display streamer names Sign Resolution Increased Wooden signs & banners now have same resolution as paintings SHIPPING CONTAINER BUILDING SKIN If you ever wanted to know what it's like to build a home out of refurbished containers, wait no more! Coming to you this month is a new building block skin with the appearance of shipping containers and some new and unique features alongside it. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230531/shippingcontainer_skin_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230601/shippingcontainer_skin_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230601/shippingcontainer_skin_06.jpg When you first build using the skin, the initial color of the container blocks are randomized. They come in 16 different colors - here is a lookup chart of the available colors: https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230531/shipping_container_color_lookup.jpg If you wish to change the look of your crib, you can now use the spray can alternate function (RMB) to display a selection wheel of the available colors and repaint your walls. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0111b1/wheel.jpg It's worth noting that the last color you spray-painted with will now be the new building blocks color used when you build additional shipping container blocks. We look forward to see how creative you get with this new skin! HAMMER RADIAL MENU IMPROVEMENTS We've listened to your feedback regarding the hammer radial menu when changing building block skins and have made some significant improvements. You can now switch between building skins with Q and E (can be configured in the options menu) while hovering over the various building tier buttons. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0111b1/radial.jpg MAP MARKER IMPROVEMENTS We’ve made some improvements to the map marker system based on your feedback from their improvements in the April update. You’ll now notice a new list of the current markers on the top left of the map screen. Clicking on these will move the map to that marker and you can delete the marker from that UI without having to move your camera, this should be helpful if you need to clear a marker quickly to place a new marker. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230601/map_markerlist.jpg The marker labels can now show an extra character on the compass, the visibility of the marker labels has been improved when placed over snow, you can now hide your team leaders markers on the map and compass via the top left menu as well as several bug fixes. PING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS Pings have also seen a set of improvements based on community feedback. One area that was flagged was being notified when a teammate has placed a ping out of your view. To help this, each ping type now has a unique sound effect and the compass will flash briefly to indicate where the new ping has been placed. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0111b1/compass.png General usability has been improved; pings can now be placed immediately when the binoculars are equipped (don’t need to zoom in) and binoculars now have a crosshair for more precise placement. Pings can also now be deleted regardless of what you are holding in your hands. Finally, the ping UI itself has been scaled up slightly and pings now fade out once they time out instead of being deleted immediately. MEMORY POOL THREAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS We've improved the way our internal memory pool handles thread safety. This should not result in any immediate changes, but it allows us to ensure we won't introduce resource contention performance issues as our multithreading scales up, particularly around networking and serialization. If you're a server owner and you notice a performance decrease from this change, please let us know. QUERY PORT CONNECT Players can now connect to a server using both the game port and the query port. This also fixes steam://connect link issues that were introduced back when we started enforcing separate query ports on servers. If you're a server owner and you want to use steam://connect links on your website, please make sure to use the query port in those links, not the game port. HORSE IDLES For a while now we've just had one long idle. It's pretty repetitive & also if you're sitting on top of a horse, you end up just getting shook around every 4 seconds. I wanted to see more variation. There is now a short base breathe anim, and lots of small idles that play randomly after a few seconds or so. There are larger actions ( like a shake of the body or head toss) as well as smaller ones ( like a tail swish or ear flick). The result hopefully looking more natural in game. WIPE TIMER IMPROVEMENTS For server owners - I updated the logic for the server wipe timer to support timezones properly. The default configuration aligns with force wipes so it shouldn't need any changing for most people. Make sure the time is set correctly on your servers! Monthly: First Thursday every month at 19:00 (London time) Weekly: Every Thursday at 19:00 (London time) Biweekly: First and third Thursday of each month at 19:00 (London time), but splits 3 week gaps into 2+1 weeks for months with 5 weeks Internally it is now using cron expressions using the Cronos library. If you'd like, you can use a custom cron expression for your wipe timer by setting the wipeCronOverride convar. You can also use a different timezone for wipes by setting the wipeTimezone convar to an IANA timezone name (see TZ identifiers on this page). There is now a printWipe console command which shows debug info about upcoming wipes which can help you set up your configurations correctly.

        "contents": "NUCLEAR MISSILE SILO This month we bring you an all-new monument that we have been quietly working on for the past few months, the Nuclear Missile Silo. While exploring the map you will run across a small military base that will be marked from the distance by a tall radio tower. While unremarkable from the outside, the base hides a secret. In its center you will find a large hatch that will allow you to access a large underground network of tunnels. https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_2.jpg Jump in while the hatch is open and you will find yourself inside a deep underground missile silo that hosts a massive ICMB. Remember that while you're in you can't go back easily, so be prepared before you enter. https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_1.jpg As you explore, you will find various rooms filled with loot and a new dangerous type of Scientists who will shoot anyone trying to interfere with their experiments. Fight your way through and take the elevators to the bottom of the structure and you will find a nuclear warhead connected to a laptop displaying an ominous countdown. https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_16.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_6.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_11.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_13.jpg To exit the monument you will need to find a security room that contains a button that will temporarily let you out. The room also contains a computer station that will allow you to access several security cameras and spy on any potential campers. https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_18.jpg WIPE EVENT As the countdown to the cycle reset approaches zero on the laptop in the missile silo, the amount of NPC activity around the island will increase. Vehicle patrols will begin on roads and fighter jets will patrol the skies. Future wipe events will include infantry patrols and bombing runs. https://files.facepunch.com/damian/1b0311b1/nms_19.jpg SMG RECOIL The Thompson and MP5 have received a buff to their accuracy. Both weapons will now have a higher probability to land center hits during extended fully automatic fire. In addition, the Thompson recoil will favor one side for slightly easier control. While SMGs are not intended to be used for long range engagements, we are aware that their usefulness at range should not be 0%. We will continue to monitor and make adjustments over the following few months. ADOBE BUILDING SKIN Available now from the Rust store is the new Adobe building skin which allows you to change the visuals of your base. This skin is for sale on the Steam store. To use, simply equip your hammer tool, display the wheel, enable building skins, this should reveal the skin's wheel on which you may choose Adobe style upgrade. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/03/8v20T1/700580_20230426210205_1.png https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/03/9863q1/700580_20230426151735_1.png https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/03/8W24A1/700580_20230426151526_1.png https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/03/2V1211/700580_20230426153934_1.png This skin is equivalent to the stone building tier for stats. We'll be releasing more building skins in the near future. LATEST WORLD MODELS To complement the new shotgun ammo world models released in the last patch. I have been busy making the metal counterparts for the pistol and rifle ammo world models. Alongside the new world models, I have also made different versions for the different ammo types. So now you will be able to tell the difference between normal and explosive ammo. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/03/1a07G1/RustClient_YcxxoqRoHi.jpg So now no more losing the raid because you picked up pistol ammo instead of rifle ammo! IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS FLASHBANG AI UPDATE Flashbangs now work against Scientists, blinding them briefly. Whilst blinded, Scientists lose their targets and are unable to accurately navigate. The effect is also slightly more effective against the new Night Vision Goggle Scientist variant. RECYCLER UPDATE The recycler now animates when in operation, so you can visually see when it doing it's thing. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0311b1/recycler.jpg GAMEPLAY ANALYTICS: 1 MONTH IN Despite some speed bumps while setting it up & a smidge of incorrect data, we already are able to make some interesting observations. Here are some graphs to showcase the kind of things we can measure. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0211b1/UBu4NqxLehvHX4P4.png https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0211b1/jaaKPGySvvs4biIQ.png If you were wondering \"what do people buy workbenches for\" https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0211b1/3d1dLzE55fp0Wxv2.png How aks are born https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0211b1/y5ijjEt9GU5Q45rL.png https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0211b1/3QY85OIbB0P4aNHC.png Total items across 50 FP servers https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b1411b1/qxdgNYlLU4XPy5iA.png https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0211b1/qcl2TevGVYoqeho8.png RUST+ CHANGES The camera view in Rust+ got some rendering improvements. Players no longer look completely out of place and everything is now lit according to the time of day. However, other lights (campfires, torches, etc.) will not show up yet. I've adjusted the ranges for players to show up in the Rust+ CCTV feeds so players need to be closer to cameras to be seen in Rust+ (now 30m vs. 100m theoretically). I also added a new range for the player's name to be sent to Rust+ so you can't see names of players far away (now 10m or closer). These are controlled by the following server convars: camerarenderer.entityMaxDistance (for general entities, which is just trees for now) camerarenderer.playerMaxDistance (default 30, can set to 0 to never show players) camerarenderer.playerNameMaxDistance (default 10, can set to 0 to never show player names) Rust+ bots have been getting out of control so we've decided to implement a few changes to make them less effective. Disallowed Rust+ from viewing all static CCTV cameras (eg. oil rigs) Crate and explosion map markers are no longer sent to Rust+ Cameras are only usable from Rust+ when you aren't connected to the server Entity/player data is now randomized by the server to make it harder for bots to understand Player names are only sent to Rust+ when close enough to the cameras We'll be monitoring further Rust+ Bot development. Automation of game input actions must be kept to a minimum using Rust+. Extensive automation of game actions such as CCTV cameras and Drones to gain an unfair advantage is not ok. TWITCH RIVALS III + TWITCH DROPS On May 16th at 8:00 pm GMT a team of 160 well-known Twitch creators from around the world will compete in this massive global Rust competition, taking place over 5 days with a prize pool worth $100k. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/03/1268a1/TR3_Twitter-StartDate.jpg During the Twitch Rivals event, Rust Twitch drops will be enabled for 5 days from selected participating channels, and well-known streamers such as hJune, Welyn, Willjum, Panpots, Buddha, DisguisedToast, Mendo and many more.

        "contents": "MAP MARKERS Map markers have received an upgrade this month, with the maximum amount of markers increasing to 5 and a new set of controls to help you store useful information along with your map. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230331/mapmarker_base.jpg Placing more markers is as simple as using the RMB as normal, and markers are deleted in the same way. If you have reached the maximum number of markers (5 by default) you will need to delete another marker to make room. To edit a marker simply click on it with the LMB and use the controls that pop up. You can select from multiple colour and icons as well as adding a label. Note that the label will be slimmed down to three characters when displayed on the compass. If you are the leader of a team all of your teammates will see all of your markers, as well as their own. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230406/RustClient_Is1IIyf5zx.png PINGS Pings are a new system to help you more effectively communicate to your teammates when using reconnaissance tools like cameras, drones and the binoculars. While using any of those items (and holding down RMB when using the binoculars) you can double tap (KEYBIND) to pop down a ping. All of your teammates will see this ping, even if you are not the team leader. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0611b1/pings_contextual_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0611b1/pings_contextual_03.jpg Single tapping the ping key will place a contextual ping when possible, for example placing a node ping when aiming at a node, a loot ping when aiming at a storage entity or a gun ping when aiming at a dropped weapon. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0611b1/ping_drone_01.jpg Double pressing the ping key will place a red hostile ping, designed to represent danger. You can also hold the ping key down to access a radial menu with all of the ping options in case you need more flexibility. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0611b1/ping_wheel_01.jpg Single tapping while looking at a ping will cancel it, otherwise the ping will expire in 10 seconds. DOUBLE HORSE SADDLE The new double saddle item lets two players mount and ride a horse. This is in addition to the old single seater saddle, so the choice is yours! Wild horses spawn with a single seater saddle and you can swap it for a double seater via the horse radial menu, if you have the required saddle item (and the other way around!). Both saddle items are available for purchase from the stablemaster or via crafting. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230331/doublehorsesaddle_01.jpg WORLD MODEL REFRESH The new refresh for the world models has finally arrived. Finally, you will be able to tell if you have dropped HV, Incendiary, or Normal Rockets! Alongside the world model refresh new world models have been created for the different types of shotgun shells. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230403/shotgunammo_01.jpg Some of the items that have had a world model refresh are : Road Sign Gloves Snap Trap High-Velocity Rocket Incendiary Rocket Shotgun Ammo https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230404/rocketammo_01.jpg Hopefully, soon there won't be any more brown burlap sacks on the island! COMPUTER STATION UI I've made a few improvements to the computer station UI this month. You can now use arrow keys or mouse wheel to switch between selected entities. The UI will also now show the health of the entity you're currently controlling. We have an existing console variable - vehicleDismountHoldTime - that can be set to a value above zero to enable hold-to-dismount on vehicles. This is now also used if you're remote-controlling a drone at the computer station. Setting it even to something small like 0.2 seconds can be a simple way to avoid accidentally dismounting and crashing your drone. IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Alt-click to ignore loot Alt-click inventory items to ignore loot containers Computer station UI Health bar, key controls, hold-to-dismount Floating Single Items When subs and boats are destroyed, storage drops single items in a floating container Vending Machine Genetics Vending machine and marketplace now display plant genetics Steam Nickname Fix Team UI will use steam nicknames GAMEPLAY ANALYTICS This month we extend our analytics platform by recording gameplay stats on official servers. There was actually an existing analytics system in place but it only showed totals for the whole game such as \"100M stone mined per day\". That doesn't tell us much, we are looking for more detailed info like: max sulfur per hour you can mine number of players gathering the same nodes in forest vs snow how quickly you get into fights while farming based on base location how far players travel to farm etc We are still in the stage of rolling it out so we don't have many pictures to show off. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b0311b1/jpmXzmjkN0pdGmQ4.png PLACE DOORS ON DEPLOYABLES A couple months back I made a commit to see if doors could be placed on top of deployables, which caused a bit too much excitement. It needed some extra fixes but now should work! CPU AFFINITY, PRIORITY & 7950X3D FIX After upgrading to a 7950x3d I realized you can't change CPU affinity when EAC is running. I added some commands so anyone can change their Rust's core affinity & process priority. You can specify multiple ranges of cores, like \"0-7,15-23\" Everyone should try using cpu_priority high and see if it makes any difference. If you have a 7950x3d, try using cpu_affinity 0-15 to keep Rust running only on v-cache cores. You can add these as steam launch parameters too: '-cpu_priority high' MULTITHREADED NETWORKING Multithreaded networking is now enabled by default for both client and server. This should help with performance of both the client and the server, particularly with network encryption enabled, which should be the case on most servers. As an additional optimization, we improved the way our memory pool handled contention between multiple threads to ensure there are no negative performance edge cases from all those additional threads. Earlier last month, we also addressed an issue where one thread was spinning at 100% utilization at essentially all times with multithreaded networking enabled. Since this was resolved, there are now no known issues and we really recommend all server owners to leave multithreaded networking enabled. SAFE MODE It's now possible to launch or reset Rust into safe mode - a basic, extremely low quality settings config to help diagnose problems. You can use safemode with a new button in the Options menu or by passing the -safemode command in the Steam launch settings. You should only use this feature if you are advised by our Support team or are experiencing problems with launching the game. Using this feature will overwrite your current settings so be sure to back them up beforehand. EASTER For the next week, every 24-38 hours in-game hours an Easter egg hunt will begin. You'll have 3 minutes to collect as many eggs as you can. The top 3 players are given special eggs as a reward. These eggs can be cracked open for various types of loot ranging from scrap all the way up to an M249! https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/04/14/269931/hunt.jpg If you don't make the podium, that's okay. The painted eggs you collect can be upgraded to Bronze eggs once you collect 10. If you collect 10 bronze eggs then you can upgrade to a silver egg, eventually all the way to gold! There are various items available to help you during your hunt. The Easter Basket will allow instant pickup of eggs and the Bunny Onesie and Ears will provide you with an advantage via Egg Vision. Have fun! EASTER STORE RETURNS Egg Suit The Egg suit is an eggsquisite egg themed craftable costume which can be painted when unequipped. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230405/eggsuit_hero_01.jpg Rustigé Egg This years beautiful handcrafted Rustigé Egg will feature a miniature underwater lab scene contained inside. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0611b1/rustige_white_01.jpg",

        "contents": "DRONE The Drone is a new player-controlled craftable deployable, operated from the Computer Station. Easily damaged from impacts. Can be picked up and deployed just about anywhere - but it doesn't have the best signal, so you'll need to control it using nearby Computer Station. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/rc_drone_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/rc_drone_01.jpg The Drone can be unlocked from the tier 2 workbench tech tree. RF DETONATED C4 C4 can now be remotely detonated via RF. Select the item and click enable RF, then set a frequency. An RF Broadcaster or detonator can then be set to the same frequency and as soon as the C4 detects the signal, BOOM. Please note that C4 deployed outside of your building privilege zone will decay after 24 hours. Also, anyone can pick it up (with a 5 second delay) so keep a look out when using it during raids. Use it to set traps in your own base or for controlled demolition of someone else's. There has never been a better time to bankrupt a clan! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/RF_C4_01.jpg PTZ SECURITY CAMERA A new player-craftable CCTV Camera system can be used for real-time surveillance and security when paired with the Computer Station. This camera has pan, tilt, and zoom capability and must be placed on a ceiling. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/ptz_securitycam_01.jpg All cameras now require 3 power instead of 5. The PTZ camera can be unlocked from the workbench level 2 tech tree. PLAYER CONTROLLED AUTO TURRET Autoturrets can now be configured to be pairable with a Computer Station. While the autoturret is turned off, there is a new menu to set the ID which you can then add in your Computer Station. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/rc_auto_turret_01.jpg When connected to an autoturret from a Computer Station you will take control of it so you can look around and even shoot at things. However, the camera on the autoturrets don't have a great view of far away objects. The autoturret cannot be controlled whilst in peacekeeper mode. CCTV IN RUST+ Something that has constantly been requested in Rust+ is the ability to view cameras. I've tried a few different solutions to get that working but had nothing that worked good enough until recently. You'll now be able to add cameras from a paired server in Rust+ and view them from your phone! This is an alpha release of the feature. I'll be working on improvements over time but, if there are any issues found, it may be disabled or limited to preserve server stability. Server owners can control this feature using the 'camerarenderer' set of convars. Video Example Here The signal from your cameras has got to travel a long way to get to your phone so everything is low quality but you should be able to make out most things in the world. All of the new, controllable cameras can also be used from Rust+! You will need to make sure you have the very latest version of Rust+ from the App Store or Google Play. You will need Rust+ native version 0.0.29 as seen in the Rust+ settings. This version of the app is currently in the process of being released so you may need to wait a bit if no updates are available on your device yet. INDUSTRIAL IMPROVEMENTS It was great to see the response to the Industrial Update last month, particularly the bases filled to the brim with pipes! As well as some general bug fixes and performance improvements, we’ve made some QOL improvements this month to help with some of the more common complaints. As always we’ll be improving this further in the future so please keep the feedback coming. New Filtering Options There is now a new option when modifying filters to allow more advanced controls. You can now change a filter to require ANY of the listed items, ALL of the listed items, or NONE of the listed items. The default is Any, which is the behaviour from last month. There have also been some changes to the number based filters, there are now 3 different number fields you can modify per item: Min, Max and Buffer. Maximum is unchanged from last month, it will stop moving items if there is greater than the amount provided in the output container. Minimum will now only move if you have greater than the supplied amount of items in the input container. For example, if you set minimum to 40 wood and you have 50 wood in the container, 10 will be moved. Buffer is the old minimum behaviour, and will only move items in predetermined buffer sizes. For example, if you set Buffer to 40 wood and you have 50 wood in the container, 40 will be moved. This is helpful when supplying the Industrial Crafter with items required for crafting. Minimum, Maximum and Buffer are only available when using “Any” and “All” filter modes, these options are not available when using the “None” filter mode. To help understand buffer transfers there is also a new UI that shows any transfers in process. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/conveyer_filter_buffers.jpg Placement Improvements The minimum distance between pipe points is now dramatically smaller, allowing for neater pipe placement around corners. There’s a new colour available (green) and “soloing” a connection by pressing RMB while looking at a plug will now keep the connection highlighted even if mousing over other entities. You can also now hold SHIFT when placing a pipe to make it collide with deployable entities, this can help run pipes around boxes and other objects in a more natural looking way. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/indst_storageadapter_01.jpg Crafter Improvements The Industrial Crafter now has 4 blueprint slots, allowing you to craft multiple items without having to connect conveyors to the blueprint slots (although those connections are still possible). When a crafter is deciding what to craft, it will look left to right and craft the first blueprint it has the required ingredients for. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230301/industrial_crafter_bpslots.jpg Network Size Limits The maximum size and depth of Industrial networks has been increased to 32 (from 16). This should allow more complex networks without having to resort to inserting extra containers. Along with this the behaviour of some item movement logic has changed: daisy chained boxes will now be filled in order rather than items being split up between them (the splitter will still split stacks though). VENDING MACHINE LOOT When the vending machine is destroyed, it drops no loot. This was too incentivise players to sell high-value items and discourage raiding player-run stores. Over the years vending machines have undergone many changes, such as drone trading via the market terminal. We've also seen players use vending machines to despawn loot in various methods and act as additional base armour. From today, when the vending machine is destroyed, it'll now drop 50% of the loot stored inside. MULTITHREADED NETWORKING RELEASE SCHEDULE We have spent the month thoroughly testing and fixing multithreaded networking and are happy to report that as of the writing of this post all known issues with it have been addressed. In order to play it extra safe we will continue testing it on official servers over the coming days and then release a server update to enable it by default for all servers. As a reminder, if you're a server owner, feel free to test things ahead of time by adding the -networkthread startup parameter to your server. Simultaneously, we will continue testing it on the client internally and then enable it for all clients by default next week. ADDITIONAL CHANGE LOG Improvements Reduced minimum gap between pipe points Can hold Shift to place entities on top of other deployed entities Reworked Maximum and Minimum filter behaviour and added a Buffer mode Added 3 more blueprint slots to the Industrial Crafter Improved pipe generation performance and fixed pipes being regenerated too often Added a green pipe colour Added an extra slot for storage adaptors on the front of small boxes Electric Furnace and Storage Adaptor performance improvements Buffer transfers will now be cancelled if a conveyor is turned off or runs out of the item mid-transfer Added a UI visualisation to show what buffer transfers are in process Conveyors will now turn back on when they receive power if they were on when they lost power Reduced volume of Industrial sounds Industrial Crafter will now only make noise when it is crafting Industrial Crafter will now pulse red if it’s output storage is full Various server garbage collection improvements Fixes Looking at another entity while an IO connection is solo’d will now maintain the solo visualisation Fixed being able to place storage adaptors in places where they would intersect with other colliders (eg. top of a small box placed under a workbench) Fixed some cases where blueprints wouldn't respect number based item filters Fixed sometimes being unable to build in areas where pipes used to be Ziplines should now be much less likely to kill the player if they collide with the terrain Ziplines should now use alternate paths more often if the terrain is too close to the desired zipline Fixed some cases where the Repair resources required UI wouldn’t appear when attempting to repair an entity Fixed contacts button staying disabled permanently after connecting to a server with contacts disabled Fixed water catchers no longer filling up with water when connected to a full water container Fixed edge case where underground train tunnel entrance would not connect to underground train station Various fixes for multithreaded networking ",

        "contents": "INDUSTRIAL Bring new levels of efficiency and unlock new avenues for automation with this month's set of Industrial entities. With these new tools you can move items around your base as well as craft items automatically without you needing to lift a finger. Storage Adaptor The Storage Adaptor is the starting point for most of your Industrial plans - simply attach an adaptor to an existing storage entity to make that entity compatible with your Industrial systems. The adaptor does not require power. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/indst_storageadapter_01.jpg Some entities have more than one slot that a storage adaptor can be attached to for ease of placement. Typically the storage adaptor can use all inventory slots on it's attached storage for input/output, although there are some exceptions: When attached to a furnace the Input will insert items into the Fuel/Inputs item slots while the output will remove items from the output slots When attached to a locker the storage adaptor will only access one partition, to access all partitions you'll need to place three storage adaptors https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/indst_storageadapter_02.jpg The storage adaptor is compatible with: Tool Cupboard Large Wooden Box Small Wooden Box Small Furnace Large Furnace Refinery Electric Furnace Locker Fridge Drop box Vending Machine Industrial Conveyor The Conveyor is responsible for moving items from one entity to another, generally via Storage Adaptors. Once powered and turned on the conveyor will look for items in containers connected to its inputs and then divide those items amongst its outputs. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230202/indst_conveyor_01.jpg By default a Conveyor will move any item it can find, but you can also assign a filter to have more precise control over exactly what items you're moving. Each Conveyor's filter can have up to 12 items or categories (resources/components/clothing/etc). When a filter is assigned the Conveyor will only transfer items that pass those conditions. You can also assign values to each item in a filter to control quantities, by setting the Maximum amount (don't send resources if the target container has over X of that resource already) and Minimum amount (only send resources in a minimum batch of X size). You'll also find a Filter Pass and Filter Fail electrical passthrough, these will activate based on the current state of the conveyor allowing you to control other parts of the Industrial network based on what items are being moved around. Pipe Tool The Pipe Tool is how you connect industrial entities - if you've used the Wire or Hose tool before you'll be right at home. Pipes come in 4 colours to help identify what's going where. Same distance rules apply here except that the anchor points need to be a small distance apart from one another and that pipes cannot go through building blocks or Vending Machines. They can go through deployables like doors. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230202/indst_pipetool_01.jpg Industrial Splitter/Combiner These work as you'd expect, allowing you to funnel or split the flow of items. In the case of a splitter connected to the output of a Conveyor, the Conveyor will spread its resources across all of its connections (eg. a Conveyor connected to a splitter which connects to three boxes that wants to send 600 wood will send 200 wood to each box). https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/indst_splitter_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/indst_combiner_01.jpg Industrial Crafter Once attached to a workbench (any tier) the Industrial Crafter allows you to automatically craft items once provided with a blueprint and the required materials. Simply insert the blueprint of your choice in the blueprint slot, insert the required materials, connect some power and turn it on to start producing items. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/indst_crafter_01.jpg The Industrial Crafter has built in Industrial slots (so no need for an adaptor) so that you can use Conveyors to insert materials and then extract the finished result. There is also a Blueprint In/Out Industrial slot allowing you to swap out the blueprint being crafted. The Crafter can only craft items that are appropriate for the workbench it's attached to and will take the same amount of time to craft an item as a player would. Electric Furnace To complement the Industrial items we're also releasing the new Electric Furnace. It works similarly to other furnaces with a slightly accelerated smelting rate except that it requires power instead of a fuel item. This also means that it doesn't produce charcoal. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/indst_electricfurnace_01.jpg Limitations and Server options To maintain server performance there are several limitations to prevent Industrial networks from becoming too out of control. There is a hardcoded 16 container input/output limit for each conveyor. This means that as well as the max depth limitation of regular IO, a conveyor will only be able to see the first 16 containers it encounters in the input/output network. There is also a hardcoded limit on how many items in a stack a Conveyor can move in a single tick - 32. If a stack has a count higher than this it will be moved gradually over several ticks. There are also several convars to control the speed and efficiency of industrial systems: server.conveyorMoveFrequency - How often conveyors attempt a move (default 5s) server.industrialCrafterFrequency - How often crafters attempt to craft something (default 5s) server.maxItemStacksMovedPerTickIndustrial - How many whole stacks a conveyor can move in a single tick (default 12) CODELOCK DEFAULT OPTIONS Previously doors would show \"Open\" as the default option whether you had the code or not, requiring you to randomly stumble upon doors you couldn't open, beeping in your face then requiring you to holding E to bring up radial menu and select unlock. The new default options are as follows: first placed = \"change code\" (to quickly set your code) unauthorized on codelock & auth on TC = \"enter code\" authorized on codelock & unlocked door = \"lock door\" (to prevent leaving doors unlocked) This should allow you to see at a glance what you still need to enter a code on & open the codelock UI much easier. TRAIN WAGON LOOT Train wagons containing crates now have different variants of varying qualities. Overall should be seeing wagons with much higher-quality loot from crates. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20230201/trainwagonloot_01.jpg CLIENT PERFORMANCE METRICS Performance is always a hot topic but it is difficult to address without having an accurate image of the problem. This month I setup logging of client performance and displayed them in various graphs. This has already proven to be useful. We noticed that exclusive fullscreen had lower FPS than borderless. Rather than guessing, we were able to query the database and confirm it. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/wx3uKyH5zF10KdAt.png See below for various graphs to get an idea of the insights we are seeing & some interesting data. Overall FPS First up is median FPS across all hardware. It doesn't give a full picture: players with 60hz monitors are included beside 144hz gamers. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/C5pAsY1RMbOTEbJS.png A better metric may be comparing average fps to monitor refresh rate to see how many players are getting lower FPS than their monitor supports... something we will look at in the future. Best Performing Hardware These charts clearly shows how Rust is CPU bottlenecked (no surprise). What is interesting is how much the extra cache does: a 5800x3D is on average 50% faster than a 5950x! Please don't use this as an excuse to go buy a better CPU as performance is subject to change... but do use this info so you avoid buying a new GPU for Rust then being surprised when it yields no performance improvement (at this time). https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/S8c257ep10IWwXrV.png https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/wcMm9VN0BCK4AGJW.png Hardware Capacity ~75% of the playerbase is running 16GB or less of RAM.... perhaps we should really prioritize why Unity is hogging all the RAM. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/ArrHNkws89v2Gmoq.png The majority of players (73%) using 1080p... yet only 2.5% of players using 4k?! https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/XFr83fJQti03VYeK.png Popular Hardware Looking at most popular CPU & GPU we find that it is similar to steam's hardware survey but differs slightly as for Rust. Here are some GPUs as % of total: Our Metrics: GTX 1650 = 6% GTX 1060 = 2.5% GTX 2060 = 5.5% RTX 3060 = 7% RTX 3090 = 0.6% RTX 4090 = 0.2% https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/9vw155LXuoH5I6fS.png Graphics settings 30% of people using motion blur 👀 only 5% of players using SMAA, 20% of players using primarily windowed mode (not borderless)... all interesting. I thought more players would have turned shadows off. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/VHGribbht897avAk.png Operating System Our Mac playerbase is very small, only 0.3% of players. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/uptPLVPlsEeC7hQH.png Yet even stranger are the people still on Windows 8... laptops perhaps? https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/1b3011b1/7Mpp1nxQlTmJLkFt.png Future Next steps are to expand to gameplay metrics. Technically.... we already have some gameplay stats but they are very limited: \"total wood gathered\", \"total kills\", etc. Better gameplay metrics will give us the ability to drill down to specific information such as: most popular weapon each day of a wipe win ratio of different weapon match-ups deaths per size of team hourly loot per monuments least used items WATER IO SERVER IMPROVEMENTS We've been aware of some server performance degradation with large scale farms and Water Catcher networks for a while and we've made some improvements this month to hopefully improve the situation. The primary performance issue at play here is the amount of processing required when an entity in an IO chain switches on or off. Under normal circumstances this doesn't happen that often but water containers are considered On when they have water and Off when they are empty. When a chain of Water Catchers are connected and sending water down a chain each container will turn on when it receives the water and then turn off as it passes the water to its next container. Water transferring is quite quick and responsive, this results in rapid sequences of entities turning on and off repeatedly which sends a lot of network updates to any clients in range and involves a lot of (largely useless) IO processing as the network changes state so rapidly. To solve these issues water will now take 10 seconds to start draining once it's inserted into a container. This means that when water travels through multiple containers each container in the sequence will build up a buffer (usually 50-100 water) in each container. This allows the same water flow as before but mostly prevents the containers rapidly turning on/off. The result is that a small sequence of 3 full barrels connected to each other powering a sprinkler used to be sending 10-20 network updates every few seconds will no longer send any updates at all while the system is active, only a few updates when the system runs out of water. This should improve performance primarily on the server but receiving less network traffic will help client performance as well. We've also modified the behaviour of Water Catchers, when a Water Catcher is going to generate some water, it will now deposit its water as far down the chain as possible. This means that if you have 3 Water Catchers connected to a Water Barrel, the catchers will actually never receive water at all, instead the water will be deposited directly into the barrel. In a benchmark of 1000 water catchers connected to each other, we found that the server's IO would become unresponsive after several minutes of gameplay as the system became overloaded with water transfer processing. With the above changes server IO performance remains instantaneous even if we artificially limit the servers frame rate. There is also a new optional server convar \"server.waterContainersLeaveWaterBehind\" that modifies the draining behaviour to leave one unit of water behind in a liquid container that drains into another container. This keeps the container in its \"On\" state permanently and further helps performance. Since this is a change in functionality it is disabled by default, if your server is still experiencing IO performance issues due to water entities turning this on may improve performance. HAPIS RETIREMENT Today we're permanently retiring Hapis Island map. Hapis Island was first introduced in April 2015 by Petur, inspired by the original Rust legacy map. Over the years, Hapis has gone through countless revisions to where it is at today. http://files.facepunch.com/petur/2017/July/06/2017-07-06_15-15-54.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/s/304da00098a5.jpg Why Retire Hapis? We're a small development team with no dedicated staff focusing on map design and creation, our mapping attention is focused on procedural maps. Hapis has continuously been developed on the sidelines as a lower-priority project with any free time Petur has. Free time is harder to find nowadays as we focus more on larger, longer-term features with a higher level of polish. Hapis Island needs a lot of attention requiring hundreds of work hours to be polished and kept fresh, which we can't currently give it. Hapis Island is missing many key features we've added over the past couple of years, zip lines, subways, new monuments and above-ground rail systems, to name a few. When Hapis can support newer features it often takes an extra month, or few for the features to be introduced to Hapis, leaving players waiting and disappointed, some features, such as the rail systems Hapis can't currently support due to a lack of internal tools. This isn't the end for static maps on Facepunch servers, we'll be working with the custom map community to fill this void over the coming weeks and months. UNITY 2021.3 UPGRADE We have upgraded the client engine to Unity version 2021.3 earlier this month. Initially there have been a number of issues from the upgrade, but we've gone through and addressed all the major ones with several small patches. This new version of Unity should open up new possibilities for both performance and visual improvements that we're hoping to introduce over the coming months. A big one is Unity's Burst compiler that will help us transition existing code in the Jobs system to a higher performance version of it. Unfortunately the upgrade also introduced a bug in fullscreen exclusive mode that caused a significant performance degradation compared to borderless fullscreen mode. Due to this we had to retire fullscreen exclusive mode. If you're encountering issues that seem related to this, please contact our support team to figure out a workaround for your specific setup. The server build of the game will remain on 2019.3 for this month while we continue testing the new engine version to make sure the server build is stable enough for a wide release. More on that hopefully next month. MULTITHREADED NETWORK TESTING We've been working on a major networking performance improvement called multithreaded networking. This will apply to both the client and the server, but naturally it will have a significantly higher impact on the server. Due to the nature of the change we wanted to make sure it's working as intended before enabling it by default, so we're first going to start testing it on select official servers this month before hopefully enabling it by default on all servers next month. If you want to start testing it before then, simply add the startup parameter -networkthread to your server or client. Please note that this is a highly experimental feature that may cause significant problems when enabled. SERVER QUERY PORT SHARING RETIREMENT As announced in the November and December devblogs, we are working on a number of networking improvements that require us to retire server query port sharing. Because of this, we have requested that all server owners that are still using this feature update their server startup parameters to use a query port that is separate from the game port. We have decided to pull the trigger and finally retire query port sharing this month. If you're a server owner who still hasn't updated their server startup parameters, please make sure to do so immediately.",

        "contents": "Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! From everyone at Facepunch, we'd all like to wish you a Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone! The Christmas Event is once again live! If you haven't been around for this before, here's what you can expect: Every once in a while you will hear the sound of jingle bells. Run outside and look for a gift! Two gifts are spawned per player, in a radius of about 40m from where you are standing. Run up and bash it open to receive your Christmas presents. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. If you have enough small presents stashed, you can \"trade up\" to a medium or large. The contents of each present vary, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and candy. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_giftboxes.jpg Once again, you will be able to find Santa hats and reindeer antlers, both of which can be worn and provide a decent amount of protection. There’s also a lickable candy cane club, and two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring the stocking will fill up with loot. The larger stocking has a higher chance for better items and both last around 5-10 refills. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_santasleigh.jpg The advent calendar is a craftable deployable available to everyone during the Christmas event. Once placed you can claim an in-game surprise once every in-real-life day. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211215/xmas_adventcalendar.jpg The Christmas event ends on January 5th @ 19:00GMT Have fun! Gingerbread / Cake Mines Run, run fast as you can, the gingerbread men are coming! Gingerbread houses have mysteriously started appearing throughout the world, leading to an underground dungeon, smelling a little like grandma's baking, but be careful, it's not going to be a cakewalk if you enter! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221208/xmasmines_entrance_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221216/caketunnels_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221216/caketunnels_02.jpg Server owners can adjust the portal count using the xmasdungeon.xmaspopulation convar.

        "contents": "RUST 9TH BIRTHDAY Rust turns 9 this month, that's 9 years of weekly and monthly updates. We’ll celebrate for one day only on 11th December with in-game birthday cake and hats. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221116/rust_bday09_2022_poster_1080p.jpg In the January end of years blog, we'll talk more about how 2022 has gone, what we've achieved and what we learned as well as our upcoming plans. MODULAR CAR CODE LOCKS Car keys have been removed from the game and replaced with code locks, which should be a lot more useful. These can be added at a vehicle lift in the same way key locks were added, and for the same price (75 metal fragments). https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221201/modularvehicle_codelock_01.jpg Features: Add, change, or remove code locks from a car at any vehicle lift. Code locks prevent mounting the vehicle - except for taxi modules - and also prevent access to storage. Players in a taxi module cannot swap seats to any other type of module. To capture a car with code locks, you can reduce the health of a seating module to 20% or less, which will enable an option to break the lock. Alternatively, if you can push the car to a vehicle lift, a new code can be set there. Note that locked cars cannot be pushed in safe zones. A mounted player can flip the Central Locking switch in a cockpit module to unlock all doors, temporarily disabling code access. Code locks on the exterior of the car will light up green instead of red. If all players in cockpit modules dismount, the central locking is automatically re-engaged. After entering the correct code, players are automatically whitelisted, and won't need to enter the code again. IMPROVEMENTS AND FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Planter Improvements Harvest/Clone/Remove all plants in a planter in one action Stone Spear Stone spear is cheaper and quicker to craft Miner's Hat Buff Miner's hat now offers better protection values Roof Rotation Roof can now be rotated before placement Grenade Crafting Times All grenade crafting times have been reduced Attack Helicopter Loot Improved Attack Helicopter loot tables Garge Doors Pickup Equipping a Hammer to pickup the Garage door is no longer required Armored Door HP Armored door HP increased by 25% Repair Cost Fixes Repairing deployables no longer require components Instrument Range Increase pitch range on several instruments Junkpile Scientists Reduced the number of Scientists at junkpiles M92 Sway Reduced sway when aiming with the M92 Despawn times Various high value items 5min -> 60min IO Deployment Various IO entities can be placed near floor level Projectile_Invalid Will show when you died first vs projectile_invalid X Days Upkeep Shows days of upkeep rather than >72 hours No Components For Repair Shotgun Trap, Garage Door, etc UI Scaling Fix small UI on 4k+ resolutions CABOOSE AT OUTPOST We've added a static (non-moving, indestructible) train caboose at the Outpost, which has the standard casino games inside: Poker, Slots, and the new Blackjack machine - so now you can play without the constant fear of death! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221129/caboose_outpost.jpg Find it at the small train platform. EXTERNAL WALL DEBRIS https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221201/debris_externalwalls.jpg The debris system was introduced in 2019 to prevent the ability to replace walls and doors during raids immediately, we feel this system has worked well but often still see raids won purely from spamming walls. To make it a little fairer for the raiders, from today, external walls and gates now have the debris system applied. When external gates or walls are destroyed, they'll now leave debris for 2 minutes. WORLD EVENT NOTIFICATIONS Players will now be automatically notified via a small UI prompt when world events begin, such as Cargoship, Oilrig crate, Ch47 Cargo etc. We hope this encourages players to engage with world events more actively and addresses a growing problem of players using third-party services to gain this information instantly before others and having an unfair advantage. We acknowledge a UI notification is not the best solution, but for now, it'll put everyone on the same playing field while we work towards a better solution in the near future. COMBAT QOL Burst Following last month's burst module implementation, I have made the following changes and improvements: Burst can now be toggled using the \"M\" bind Burst module slightly lowers aim cone LR & MP5 The LR and MP5 has seen lower usage since the recoil changes, players who used to opt for the LR often now feel more confident using the AK, so we're experimenting with the following changes: MP5 and LR now have inbuilt burst module We'll continue monitoring and adjust accordingly in future updates. Slug Ammo Slug ammo is regularly used over large distances effectively, whilst it's great to see slug ammo used to a greater effect with the recent changes, we agree with player feedback it's too effective. The slug should be a hard-hitting option in close to mid-range combat and less effective over larger distances, so I've made the following changes: Slug now does 50% damage at 40 meters+ instead of 75% damage at 80+ Slug does 100% damage from 0-20m instead of 0-10m QUARRY UPDATE Mining quarries have been updated to run on diesel fuel and output rates greatly improved. In the past, quarries have seen little to no use. We hope these improvements will encourage their use more. We'll be monitoring and tweaking accordingly. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/11/29/9r75W1/RustClient_Un0DgG8zfJ.jpg In addition to spawning at the Dome, Oil Rigs and Junkyard, diesel fuel now spawns at the following monuments: Water Treatment Plant, Power Plant, Military Tunnels and Airfield. OFFSHORE MONUMENTS Lower lab count but larger Oilrig reset timer increase Cargoship event rarer UPDATED COLORED IO There were only 5 colors of wires originally (4 hose colors) which hasn't been enough to organize the creative builds the community has made! Existing Colors black red green blue yellow New Colors light blue orange pink purple white Press \"R\" while looking at an existing wire to recolor it. SEPARATE NETWORK GROUPS FOR TUNNELS For some background, network groups are what Rust servers use to figure out which entities to network to players. It basically divides the world up into chunks and tracks which entities are within each chunk. This way the Rust server just needs to network the few chunks around each player. Previously the world was divided up into a two dimensional grid of chunks, and that worked great for a long time, but then we added the underground tunnels. Using two dimensional network groups means the tunnels would network to players up on the surface, and players in the tunnel are being networked things from the surface, which isn't great because they can't see any of that so it's just wasted work. I updated the network group system this month to add support for vertical layers. So now, instead of a just a single two dimensional grid, it essentially stacks multiple two dimensional grids on top of each other and uses entity's altitude to figure out which layer it belongs on. Tunnel entities will no longer network to the surface, and the surface will no longer network to players in the tunnels. We have found that this can save up to 0.4ms of frametime on the surface by not networking tunnel NPCs to the client. JUNKPILE AI I've made a few improvements to help with some of the complaints that people have with Junkpiles. The bushes that spawn with junkpiles now block AI line of sight. This should make the Scientists easier to spot when they're shooting at you because they will no longer stand in the middle of a bush. I've also made the junkpile Scientists more defensive in nature, and they won't engage from as far as they used to. Lastly, I've tweaked the AI data for the junkpile cover positions so they're fully in cover, which has the knock on effect of reducing return fire. ANIMAL AI I've added some biome and topology-specific functionality: Animals will no longer roam directly to ocean-side locations, to help keep them away from beaches. Polar bears will now only roam to arctic and tundra areas, and they will also now return to these areas if they need to leave briefly for any other reason. WORLD FOOT QUICK-EAT I've added a menu option for eating world foods, such as berries, corn, mushrooms, etc, directly from the ground. Look directly at the food and hold E then select \"Eat\". You still receive seeds and other items as usual. NETTING FIXED Netting now allows you to walk above without getting stuck. You can also climb up and slide down without bouncing off the wall frames. TURRET AUTH EASIER Turret UI used to close after you authorized each player. The UI now stays open after each player you click, until you press \"Esc\". WALL PLACEMENT IMPROVEMENT Building jump ups used to be difficult when you had to look down precisely to get it to snap to the correct place. It now will correctly try to attach to the top of walls. LOCKER FILL IMPROVEMENTS Filling lockers was difficult with the amount of left click dragging required. You should now be able to mindlessly right click armor and have it go into all the correct slots. SAM SITE PASS-THROUGH It used to be devastating if enemies shot out your SAM sites & were able to shoot off a MLRS strike before you had a chance to react. You can now pass power through the sam site & link it to a smart alarm to detect it being destroyed STEAM NETWORKING POSTPONED As mentioned in last month's blog, Steam networking was planned to be switched to the default networking layer for Rust today. Due to several issues discovered recently (now fixed), we're postponing enabling Steam networking by default until January, by then, we hope to be completely satisfied with server stability. As a reminder: This change requires servers to have a separate Steam query port set via the -queryport server startup parameter. When no query port is set, the server will default to either game port + 1 or rcon port + 1, depending on which number is larger. Hosts of shared servers will need to ensure the query port is forwarded correctly, which is why we are making this announcement ahead of time. Servers can be switched over to Steam Networking for testing via the -swnet startup parameter, which we recommend doing ahead of time in order to ensure a smooth transition. CHRISTMAS UPDATE On December 15th at 19:00GMT / 14:00 EST we'll be releasing a mandatory server and client update to enable the Xmas event and some festive features! CHARITABLE RUST RECAP On November 19th Rustafied held their 8th annual Charitable Rust event. They had event servers up where hundreds of content creators all took part in fun custom games, bed wars, carnivals, boat combat contests, and much more. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b2811b1/charitable-rust_twitter.png The community raised over $27,000 in donations alone. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b2811b1/donations.png We also put up some unique charity skins on the Rust item store for a week and the proceeds to that go towards the charity as well. While we do not have exact totals yet and the skin sales take a few weeks to come in but we guestimate $150,000 in total, going to World Central Kitchen. We're very proud of everyone involved and thank you to those that helped out in any ways to make this event possible!",

I present to you: cRust He made it in 7 days ..allegedly It's better than Rust ..allegedly 1 person at PAX enjoyed it ..allegedly Absolutely no copyright infringements ..maybe WHENS CAPYBARAS?? CREATOR SPOTLIGHT This month we have your resident building inspector, Dust! \"Yo! My name's Dust, I'm a Rust YouTuber with a focus on base build videos, but also high quality cinematics and full length gameplay movies! My friend convinced me to download Rust in 2018 and I’ve barely seen a blade of grass since. What really hooked me was watching awesome content by Evil Wurst, Blooprint, Tesla, Frost, aloneintokyo and a ton of other insanely talented creators. I started YouTube pretty recently and things quickly took off. Even though I started as a build channel, there’s been a ton of demand for more movies so I’m working on putting out more action packed wipe content! Stay tuned! On a real note, my favorite part about this whole journey has been the friendships that I’ve made along the way. Rust is a super unique game where you’ll end up spending hundreds or thousands of hours with people, so you’ll tend to build some really strong and genuine friendships. The creator community in Rust is also super collaborative and filled with some awesome people.\" He's gotten pretty good with those cinematics! PAX COSPLAY Camomo sent us in some awesome cosplay pics from PAX AUS last month! Think one of these guys was in Memeio's cRust video :) https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b1511b1/IMG_2702.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b1511b1/IMG_2722.jpg There are professional versions too! https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b1511b1/5B933E06-1B0B-43A6-9D89-D8B8B19B88DE.jpg JINGLE JAM 2022 Just a heads up for all you Rust Roleplay enjoyers out there!

After an exhaustive review of potential candidates, the Prototype 17 was selected. This new weapon has a magazine capacity of 18 and fires in deadly 3 round bursts with the single pull of the trigger. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221102/rust_prototype17_firstperson.jpg In addition, it features tritium sights for rapid target acquisition and engagement under low light conditions. It has been noted that some survivors have scavenged and reverse engineered the weapon, extracting some of its components and allowing them to augment their own weapons with the 3 round burst ability. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221103/rust_prototype17_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221102/prototype17_range_01.jpg CABOOSE We've added a new train carriage that you might find on sidings. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221102/caboose_exterior_01.jpg Inside you'll find a poker table with four seats, two slot machines, and a brand new blackjack computer that can handle 1-3 players. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221102/caboose_interior_01.jpg All the features of blackjack are here, and blackjack pays out 3:2.

It uses a technique called HLOD (Hierarchical Level of Detail) and involves baking the monument as it should be seen at a distance down into a single mesh. A key requirement was to make sure this didn't add any extra work for our environment artists, this process is almost entirely automated. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/11/02/0140l1/GScE57r6FX.gif https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/11/02/2S09Y1/ezgif-3-a14076f95b.gif The final performance improvements were minimal, but the increased visual fidelity at a distance still seemed worthwhile to ship. You should notice more geometry and detail, as well as entire monuments that will now be visible when they weren't before. ANNOUNCEMENT: STEAM NETWORKING / QUERY PORT We have plans in place to switch the default networking layer of Rust servers from RakNet to Steam Networking in late November or early December, further communication will follow. This change requires servers to have a separate Steam query port set via the -queryport server startup parameter. When no query port is set, the server will default to either game port + 1 or rcon port + 1, depending on which number is larger.

You'll have 3 minutes to collect as many candies as you can. The top 3 players are given special loot bags as a reward. These candies and loot bags can be opened for various types of loot ranging from scrap all the way up to an M249! If you don't make the podium, that's okay. The candies you collect can be upgraded for better loot. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211026/halloween_mummies.jpg There are various items available to help you during your hunt. The Pumpkin Bucket will allow instant pickup of candies and the Scarecrow Wrap and Ghost Costume will provide you with an advantage via Candy Vision. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211026/halloween_scarecrow.jpg The Halloween event will run until November 3rd. Have fun! PORTALS Cultists are said to have been opening portals throughout the world, others believe it's a Cobalt experiment code-named R.U.I.N gone horribly wrong. Not much is known about these portals or what they do, only a few chads have entered and made it back alive. Do you dare to enter? https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221020/dungeonportal_01.jpg Server owners can adjust the portal count using the halloweendungeon.population convar. NEW HALLOWEEN ITEMS This year we've added three new Halloween themed items to the Rust store. Hockey Facemask Hide your facial deformities with this creepy hockey mask. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221020/hockeymask_01.jpg The Hockey Facemask skin is a reskin of the Metal Facemask. Cultist Deer Torch The Cultists must have dropped this while opening the portals throughout the world. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221020/cultistdeertorch_01.jpg The Cultist Deer Torch is a reskin of the starter torch. Once the torch skin is selected or crafted, you'll respawn with this skin. Baseball Bat It wouldn't be a zombie apocalypse without hitting zombies in the head with a baseball bat! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221020/baseballbat_01.jpg The Baseball bat is a reskin of the mace melee weapon. Now purchasable at the Rust item store. FRANK IS BACK! GRHRRR.. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211026/frankenstein_hauntedhouse.jpg To start building your own monster, first, you must slay scarecrows and mummies that roam the lands. Once you've collected a head, torso and legs, craft yourself a Frankenstein's table and place the body parts within the table. Awaken your new pet monster and control it by pressing \"P\". https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211026/monstertable_wakeup.jpg The monster will follow your orders without question. It'll follow you around the map, defend you if attacked and help slay foes you wish to attack. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211026/monstertable_tier3.jpg If you're having trouble accessing the pet menu or already have a key bound to \"P\" then use the following console command: bind X +pets or open the in-game controls menu.

        "contents": "LUMBERJACK PACK This month we're introducing a new addition to Rust's permanent store, the Lumberjack Pack. The Lumberjack Pack contains five items, four tools and one hazmat reskin. Lumberjack suit The Lumberjack suit is a hazmat replacement skin that can be applied while crafting the hazmat or skinned using the repair table. The Lumberjack suit offers no in-game bonuses. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221005/lumberjack_hazmat_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221005/lumberjack_hazmat_01.jpg Tools The Lumberjack additionally comes with four craftable tools. The concrete tools are reskinned versions of the stone tools, and the prototype tools share the same stats as the metal tools. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221005/lumberjack_tools_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221005/lumberjack_tools_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20221005/lumberjack_tools_03.jpg The Lumberjack pack is available now from the Steam store and in-game store. FURNACE UI IMPROVEMENTS Following feedback from last month's Furnace UI revamp, I made the following changes: All slots now cook at the same time. Added progress bar when smelting items New burning icon for items https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0611b1/furnace.png I also fixed a number of issues relating to ores dropping out of furnaces when overfilling. Splitting ores stacks between input slots will still not increase production rates. SERVER LISTING UI UPDATE As a part of a large long term menu UI revamp I have made several improvements to the server listing UI this month. Here are the most note worthy changes: Added regions server tags. Update tag search behavior to find servers with all of the selected tags instead of any of them. Add a button to clear filters to the server browser. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0611b1/server%20browser.png Additionally, I reimplemented dropdown menus in the options menu. This should make life easier than clicking endlessly to find certain options such as screen resolution. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/10/05/3z8951/RustClient_gKroq97xYG.png CAMPFIRE AND EFFECTS The campfire is one of Rust's oldest models, dating back to pre-2015. It was time for an update to reflect Rust 2022. Issac has worked his magic and updated the model which can be seen below. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/10/05/9g14E1/RustClient_kjzWVxIlmv.jpg Along with the new model comes new visual effects courtesy of Petur. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/10/05/2B08w1/RustClient_MrnE2nx8re.jpg Petur has updated the effects on the campfire, large furnace, furnace and cauldron. These updated effects not only look better but also offer better performance. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Train Offloading LGF Train fuel wagons now contain more low grade fuel Debris Building Blocker Debris building blocker now immune to explosive damage Not focused FPS Limit Added an option to cap framerate to 15FPS when not focused Radio Ga Ga Radio stations can now be updated without releasing client/server updates Train Bell Hitting the bell on the train now goes \"ding ding\" HARDCORE TECHTREE TAX We received a lot of feedback surrounding the Workbench Techtree on hardcore since its launch last month, many wanting it removed completely from this game mode. While weighing options we've decided to explore a tech tree tax. Unlocking items directly from the Workbench Techtree will now cost additional scrap, Tier 1 - 20% Tier 2 - 40% Tier 3 - 60% The research cost from using the research bench remains unchanged. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/12/03/3u07l1/chrome_ZCn9BO0k3S.jpg CONTAINER SIZE IMPROVEMENTS Following last months storage changes we have now increased car storage module size from 18 to 48. Camper storage 12 to 18 and Saddle bags 6 to 12. EAC AND PROTON We're aware the server performance has degraded since the release of EAC EOS update on September 30th, we're actively working with EAC to remedy these issues. Server owners can expect hotfixes over the coming days and weeks. Proton Support You know, we switched to EAC's new platform with the intention of providing support for the Steam Deck, and so far we haven't done that. So when is it coming? Well, short answer is we don't know. We don't know if it is. When we discontinued linux support in 2019, one of the core reasons was how the cheating community was exploiting the Linux platform. That's not to say that cheating was super widespread on Linux, but it was safer for cheat developers. And that's not good in a game like Rust where a cheater can ruin weeks of hard work. Enabling proton support would mean we're asking the EAC team to provide support for a whole other platform, which we fear would reduce their ability to support Windows - our main platform. We don't know whether we should enable one platform at the disadvantage of another. The one thing we don't want to do is to enable Proton support to only discontinue it six months later. We don't want to encourage players to spend their money on a Deck to play Rust and then be in a position where we want to take that ability away. For now, we're still weighing up the risks and will continue to explore options with EAC. Don't expect to see Proton support in the near future, but we hope to have it enabled someday.

At the time, I was playing a lot of the Arma2 DayZ mods so figured it was right up my alley. I played it on and off but wasn't properly hooked until early 2016. I had just dropped out of University and finally had the right amount of time to enjoy the game. What's always made me fall back in love with this abusive relationship of a game, is the thrill of having all of your hours of effort taken away, but on the flip side being able to do it to others too. It makes everything feel so much more exhilarating and gives fights a lot more meaning than in any other game I've ever played. After watching some Trausi and Bchillz I decided to post some of my clips and videos on Youtube, which did pretty well for that time. Sadly I was also an anxious mess having my motivation fade in and out. Youtube's income was basically a coinflip and I wanted a bit more stability. That's when I decided to take a break from things for the next 3 years and got a degree. In that time is when I would really come to enjoy streaming, mainly due to the back and forth jokes you can get from chat. I'm happy that my caveman ass got to meet so many people through this weird game of hitting rocks with rocks.\" https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b1611b1/blizz%20twitch.png Big Brain It's it every day your base build restrictions line up with a doorcamper in your airlock, but when they do...

        "contents": "Hardcore Gamemode A major part of Rust is its brutal nature and ruthless PvP, when we added the softcore gamemode last year we saw and have continued to see feedback that many of you want a game mode which takes away the standard Vanilla comforts we've added throughout the years and gives a more ruthless, hardcore experience, so we've done just that. Introducing Hardcore mode - a new game mode in Rust aimed towards veteran players, gone are the comforts such as safezones, team system and maps but don't worry, the vast majority of our servers will still be regular vanilla Rust. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0111b1/9568d48cf1b34cf1f84df0385a01e444.jpg During this first pass, you will find the following changes on Hardcore servers: Added: Local chat (100m range) Limit of 5 sleeping bags & beds In-game changelog (top left of inventory) Removed: Contact system Compass Crawling when wounded Global chat Rust+ Team system Map MLRS Safe zones Changed: Blueprints wipe monthly We believe this is a good starting place for a less forgiving game mode of Rust and we will continue to iterate and improve on it moving forward. If you're a server owner and wish to enable hardcore use the following var in your server startup config \"-gamemode hardcore\" 10 new official servers will be launching today with this new game mode. New Furnace UI Furnaces & cooking interfaces were cumbersome and not intuitive for newer players to use, requiring precise splitting of stacks to smelt efficiently, online calculators and guides to manage efficiently. We disliked this and felt we could do better, so we revamped the UI and some functionality. They smelt and cook at the same speed & capacity (or better!) as before while being quick and easy to use. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0111b1/furnace.jpg With this update, you'll no longer be able to store non cooking/smelting-related items inside your cooking deployables (furnace/campfire), to address this see storage buff below. Storage Buff Over the past couple of years, we've quadrupled the number of in-game items and switched over to the component system, all of which require large amounts of additional storage. Now with the cooking and smelting UI revamp and removing the ability to store items within these deployables (campfire, furance etc) it was overdue we took a look at storage. Today we've increased the small wooden storage capacity to 18 from 12 and the large wooden box to 48 from 30. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/01/6127U1/RustClient_dv0RzfYSHp.jpg In the future expect to see new types of storage solutions. Coaling Tower V2 I made some simple improvements to the coaling tower that aired in our last update inside the Trainyard monument. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/01/8m64u1/RustClient_hd3gLszYwq.jpg These changes include a new way to access the tower from the top where the suspended bridge is located. This will make retreat from the building easier when the area is contested. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/01/1n42g1/RustClient_PLDs4YY2EH.jpg Quality of Life Changes/url] Single Pickup UI Mass pickups now contained within a single UI widget when hitting resources Zipline Trees Trees no longer block ziplines causing players to dismount and fall Respawn Fall Damage Fixed a long standing bug cuasing players to receive fall damage after respawing Hapis Island After neglecting our poor island last month, we are now patching in a boatload of much needed fixes, along with adding in a few improvements. The new \"HDRP\" cliff models are way more temperamental regarding placement than the old ones, and as a result we've had our hands full identifying and plugging tons of little holes to stop sneaky players from abusing the map. This patch fixes every single one we've had reported and identified. In addition, the long southern and northern road tunnel placeholders have been reworked. Instead of being these overly long and unpractical spaghetti monsters, they now follow a precise and much shorter path to make them a practical way to traverse. We've also dressed them up and added various loot spawns along the way. Lastly, the road surface has been a complete mess since the big update, thanks to some technical issues I won't bore you with - but this has also been tackled now. Roads everywhere should now be smooth to drive on, with no sinking anywhere. I won't go over all the other small fixes here and there, but know that we will continue to improve and fix anything else that comes up. Big thanks to all who submitted bug reports! Reclaim and Marketplace I've updated the old placeholder reclaim (softcore mode) and marketplace models with something much more in keeping and unique. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/01/7A83q1/RustClient_qi9nbD6loV.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/01/1O37p1/RustClient_vrbXiVMQQZ.jpg Twitch Rivals Recap Rust x Twitch Rivals 2 was a huge success! and we wanted to share some interesting stats with you.

This guy seeks out danger. \"In 2016 (I was 15 at the time), I was playing too much CSGO and was starting getting to get bored of it. Was really good timing that my friends could show me Rust as a another first person shooter game. Fell in love with the game in my first few hours of playing and been playing ever since. What I love about this game is that you can do sooooo many different things. Everyday is different! Of course, just the pure chaos that can occur. Its not like CSGO when you load in to a match on same map everyday. The people I was watching the most was hJune, Frost, Ramsey. But hJune was the one I watch the most I was like 'how is this guy so hecking good at this game?'. Made me wanna get as good as him.\" Pretty great Twitch clip of him being a maniac.

        "contents": "TRAINYARD UNLOADING TOWER https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/08/03/5e88W1/RustClient_4qxDMc4why.jpg The above-ground rail network is now connected up to the Trainyard area, and the Trainyard has a new tower that can unload certain types of train wagons. Railway sidings will now sometimes spawn unloadable wagons in several varieties Ore wagons filled with sulfur, iron, or charcoal Fuel tank wagons filled with low grade fuel Loot wagons that can be unloaded to reveal loot crates https://files.facepunch.com/BillB/1b0211b1/screen1.jpg All of these can be hooked up to a train and taken to the unloading tower at Trainyard for unloading. You'll need a green keycard and a fuse to get full access, after which you can unload as many wagons as you like. Ore and fuel go into an output hopper and fuel tank respectively inside the tower. Loot wagons activate their crates when emptied so you can then go out and loot them. The above-ground Work Cart train engine has been reduced in power, and is now only able to pull a small amount of train cars at a time. The large new Locomotive provides superior pulling power instead. https://files.facepunch.com/BillB/1b0211b1/screen2.jpg FLASH BANG AND MOLOTOV COCKTAIL Two new throwable items have been added to the game. The Molotov Cocktail is a powerful area denial weapon which slows movement and deals damage over time. It can also be used to damage and destroy wooden structures. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/08/03/2Z35y1/RustClient_srE4gpBPFB.jpg The Flashbang is a short fuse, low damage explosive which will blind and disorient anyone unfortunate enough to be in the blast radius and looking in it's general direction. We're hoping the addition of this tool reduces the benefit of corner camping and shakes up how room clearing is approached Both are available in the tech tree of the T2 workbench. https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0211b1/Unity_bgSEttohz1.jpg QOL Updated Wooden Signs The Wooden sign has been received a model update Scrap Tea Buff Scrap Tea now yields more scrap and lasts longer Improved Cliff Collision A number of cliff colliders have been improved, making them easier to climb Invalid Projectiles when Mounted Fixed a long standing bug causing invalid projectiles when mounted to vehicles CUBEMAP AMBIENT LIGHT The lighting in Rust has been quite outdated for a long time. The primary reason for this have been our highly dynamic environments that prevent us from using any sort of statically baked lighting data. This resulted in flat and boring looking environments, particularly in areas that weren't receiving any direct light. To combat this, I finally implemented our own ambient lighting model that uses a blurred version of our existing reflection data, which is already completely dynamic. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/08/03/4U33x1/RustClient_EwHMKi2CFt.jpg The new lighting model is of course enabled for everybody, but it comes with a few customization options. The previous \"World Reflections\" quality setting has been replaced with two toggles in the \"Experimental\" graphics options: Advanced interior lighting, which when enabled includes player bases in the new lighting model, and advanced forest lighting, does the same for trees. PERFORMANCE WORK I spent a good part of the month looking for client performance optimisations with varying levels of success. I removed a variety of unnecessary components from all humanoid NPCs (Scientist, dwellers, shopkeepers, etc). This should reduce the performance hit when entering network range of an NPC. I removed unnecessary components from various static entities that are placed in monuments (think vending machines, chairs, etc). This should make them spawn faster when entering network range. I made some changes to our LOD system to more aggressively disable shadows in places where it will make no visual difference. This includes any static prop that is considered \"small\" and parts of the player body (clothing, eyebrows, teeth, etc). These changes should reduce the number of shadow casting meshes when more than a couple of meters away from a prop or player. Both of these changes can be disabled by the graphics.AggressiveShadowLod and graphics.AggressiveShadowLodWearable convars but they will be enabled by default this month. Underground props that are part of the train tunnels are now more aggressively culled if you aren't in a train tunnel. Made more potential optimisations to the performance drop when hitting a tree/resource node. This is mostly due to the UI animating in the bottom right of the screen and a lot of the performance cost is happening outside of our control. I've still made a few improvements that should hopefully improve it but there is still a mild performance drop. MONUMENT LIGHTING & LIGHT SWITCHES I spent some time over the past few weeks adding new lights to a bunch of our older monuments. Now nearly all of them should be covered this pass, aside from a few monuments that are meant to be completely abandoned and should remain dark. This includes monuments such as Harbors, Power Plant and the Trainyard. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/08/03/2r73a1/RustClient_goTQZRqYR0.jpg In addition, you will find that the monuments covered by the lighting pass will now feature light switches that you can use to toggle the lights on and off. You can now decide whether you want the comfort of seeing clearly in the dark at a risk of being seen by other players, turn the lights off for your safety while exploring, or use them to ambush unsuspecting players. ADS IMPROVEMENTS We recently saw a video from hJune which helped us identify a long standing issue with the aiming code. Basically, if you when into ADS mode shortly after running, the weapon bob was not immediately disabled, and instead took far too long to gradually dissipate. This resulted in a disparity between the weapon sight and the true aim direction, meaning you were not actually aiming at your target for the first several shots. This has been fixed and aiming down the sight should feel a lot more responsive and snappy. OFFENSIVE CONTENT REPORTING Thanks to everyone for taking the time to report offensive content last month, we were able to clear a lot of content on official servers as a result. To help us quickly act on your reports, I made a Slack tool this month that allows us to remove any reported content directly from Slack, without having to load the game up. If server owners are looking for similar functionality we can recommend the Discord Sign Logger plugin by MJSU. https://files.facepunch.com/Slack_2022-08-01_23-12-39nOwqmz93KC.jpg Please keep sending your reports in! RUST TWITCH RIVALS 2 https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b0311b1/TR2_Twitter%20-%20Start%20Date.png On August 9th at 8:00 pm GMT a team of 160 well-known Twitch creators world around the world will compete in this massive global Rust competition, taking place over 5 days with a prize pool worth $100k. During the Twitch Rivals event, Rust Twitch drops will be enabled for 5 days from selected participating channels, well-known streamers such as hJune, Mendo, Welyn, Bchillz, Willjum, Panpots and of course the team captains Thegrefg, dhalucard, xqc and Disguised Toast. Over the course of the 5 days, teams will build up their bases and supplies. Eliminating each other from day 3 onwards with the last man standing on day 5. We'd like to thank Rustoria for working with us and Twitch to make this event possible. Learn more at twitch.facepunch.com. LEGAL UPDATE We updated our legal documents, to comply with recent consumer protection and data protection law changes since we last visited the documents in 2019. We re-added an IP infringement notice form that had disappeared somehow. You can see all historic versions at https://github.com/Facepunch/Legal. The changes will take effect in the next 30 days and you can email any questions to legal@facepunch.com. FULL BLOG DETAILS & CHANGELOGS",

Muting, Reporting, & Censorship We've made it easier! I touched on this last summer in a Update 235 but we felt being able to mute other players was a little convoluted and could use a facelift. We've now added some options to the contact card system. Here you will now have both a mute button and a report button. This could be incredibly useful to someone not wanting to hear close proximity mic spam. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b1811b1/contact.jpg Here you can Mute, Report, and put notes about the player. You can set them as friendly or enemy. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b1811b1/reporting.jpg Reporting players for bad behavior is always good as it leave a \"papertrail\" and many community servers scrub for these reports. Using in-game reporting options will capture all the relevant information required to check into them. Always good to check with your favorite server of choice on their preferred way to report.

        "contents": "Combat Balance Since the release of the Combat Update, we've monitored player feedback and overall we're happy with the state of the gunplay in Rust. We will continue to listen, and make adjustments when needed. The fuse time on the F1 grenade has been decreased by 0.5 to 2.5s. During combat testing we felt that grenades were a bit too easy to evade under most circumstances. Maybe some day we will allow players to cook grenades but right now that seems like it would be a bit too cheap of a tactic. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220705/july_2022_header.jpg The M39 has had it's role changed so it feels more like a superior SAR. Its fire rate has been increased and recoil modified. We've also noticed that shotgun slugs were very underused so we have reduced the damage falloff so that shotgun users can opt to utilize them in mid range combat and stand a chance. Lastly, we've fixed a long standing issue with viewmodels where the first shot shortly after ADSing would play the non-ADS animation and obscure the screen with the view model. All weapons should feel much more snappy now. Following the release of the combat update last month we addressed the following issues earlier this month, here is a recap: Improved hide blood option Added hurt flash disable option m249 is slightly more aggressive HMLMG recoil is more aggressive Lowered HMLMG durability Increased HMLMG crafting cost Using scopes on weapons now increases their recoil Reduced blur/blood effects Accuracy bonus removed from the silencer Loading Optimization We worked on reducing the time it takes to load into servers this month. It will now queue up the loading of assets so they can continue being read from disk while the main thread spawns all of the world prefabs, which means better utilization of hardware. This also applies to the dedicated server so server owners may see some improvement with boot times. The long \"Asset Warmup\" phase of loading will now start running in the background as soon as the game reaches the main menu. Connecting to a server will not wait for it to complete -- it will keep running in the background until it finishes. The game will no longer unload monument assets when running on a computer with 16GB or more of RAM. This allows for much faster server switching because the monument assets would already be loaded. Setting the global.forceUnloadBundles convar to true will override that behavior so it always unloads the monument assets. Gunshot sounds Alex finished up the remaining new gunshot sounds this month, including new silent shots for every gun. We'll likely do another round of tuning on these in the next month or so to address some feedback we've gotten but we'd like to allow time for folk's ears to adjust and the dust to settle before we dig too deep into that. General QOL Spray Can crosshair - Added a crosshair when free spraying Mute and report contacts - Can now mute/unmute and report players from the contacts screen Placement Rotation - Mailbox, BBQ, Medium Battery and Windmill now face toward the player by default Return To Sender - Can now insert photos into mailbox Inventory idle animation - Updated player inventory idle animation Jackhammer Tapping - Jackhammer will hit hotspot every time without tap firing UGC Admin Panel To better help server admins moderate the content on a server, I've implemented a new section in the Server Admin tab that allows admins to easily see all of the User Generated Content on a server. This includes all painted signs, audio content on cassettes, carvable pumpkins, neon signs and pattern boomers. https://files.facepunch.com/Unity_2022-07-04_10-45-58fk2upZm1ak.jpg As well as being able to see/hear the content, admins can now see who was responsible for the content and delete the content from the UI without having to travel to that entity. There is also a search field so all content created by a specific player can be found quickly. Offensive Content Reporting We've improved the process of reporting problematic content this month by implementing a new Offensive Content report type. When reporting offensive content a screenshot will now be included to better help admins act on the issue. https://files.facepunch.com/Unity_2022-07-04_11-27-34yUSdQ16nQN.jpg For server admins, there are new convars to better access these reports: reportsServerEndpoint - if set, player reports on your server will be sent to this http address (as JSON) printReportsToConsole - if set, player reports will be logged to the server log For more information on using these new convars, please see the wiki. Hapis Island updates Along with numerous small bugfixes, we've added 3 new monuments to Hapis Island. Two of them in the desert, and one in the northern arctic. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/07/07/2Q75P1/RustClient_GbhTFROCox.jpg We also fixed most of the mountain goat ore nodes, berry bushes not spawning, roadside spawns being overly sparse, and updated some existing monuments to be more in line with where they now stand on Procedural Map. Some bugs still remain, but we're ironing it out. Thanks for all the bug reports! Harmony QOL You can now load/reload harmony mods onto the server at runtime with: `harmony.load ` and unload with: `harmony.unload ` This will allow all server owners (vanilla or modded) to deploy fixes onto their servers without needing to restart them, as well as ease development of harmony mods. Chat Filtering We're now using Steam's chat filtering functionality to obscure strong language and slurs in chat and other text players can share in the game. The filtering is applied on the client and can be customized in your Steam account preferences. If you haven't changed these settings before then filtering would already be enabled. DEBUG CAMERA ADDITIONS A few new debug camera commands have been added this month for content creators to use. As with existing camera tools, these can only be used by server admins or in demo playback. Physical Camera Properties We've added the ability for the debug camera to use physical camera properties - in other words, you can choose from common camera sensor types and specify a focal length to mimic real world photography measurements. Below are the newly added commands for using physical camera settings: client.camphysical (1/0) - Enable/disable physical camera properties on debug camera client.camphysicalsensortypes - Prints camera sensor types with corresponding number client.camphysicalsensor - Select physical sensor for debug camera (use sensor ID number from the above 'sensortypes' convar) client.camphysicalfocallength - Set focal length of the debug camera (Measured in mm) Camera Info UI https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220704/caminfo_ui.jpg Along with the above physical camera commands, we've also added camera information UI which can be enabled/disabled using the command client.showcaminfo 1/0 When enabled, this overlay will display the following information at the top of the screen: Camera FOV Depth of field aperture and blur values Camera lock status (debugcamera_lock) Sensor type (if using physical camera mode) Focal length (if using physical camera mode) MAP MAKER PREFABS This month we've added some useful assets for community map makers - the most notable being the introduction of tiled cube prefabs. The current collection features over 60 cubes with materials including brick, wood, metal, concrete, plaster, metal, cloth and more. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220704/tiled_cubes_collection.jpg Each cube can be scaled, rotated and positioned in custom map scenes whilst maintaining the local tiling of the individual prefab's texture. We look forward to seeing the many creative ways map makers will utilize these assets and we hope to continue expanding this collection in the future. Acknowledgements We're currently aware and investigating certain performance issues affecting a large number of users, this is also known to be affecting third-party applications such as Discord, we believe this is possibly fixed today via an update by EAC. We are also actively investigating a number of other areas with poor performance. Changelist Added tiled cube prefabs for community map makers Added chat filtering Improved M39 DPS and recoil Lowered F1 grenade fuse time to 2.5s (was 3.0s) Shotgun slugs have reduced damage falloff Achievement todo list is now disabled if game tips are turned off in the game options Added a crosshair while free spraying with a Spray Can Increased the default number of sprays per player (25 -> 40) Can now Mute and Report players from the Contacts screen Z/C/Y keys no longer control zoom when in free camera (replaced with debugcamera_zoomin and debugcamera_zoomout binds) Added debugcamera_raise and debugcamera_lower binds instead of hardcoding to Q/E Added physical camera convars for the debug camera Added camera info overlay command for the debug camera Kayak now faces away from the player deploying by default Mailbox, BBQ, Medium Battery and Windmill now face toward the player by default (CUI) Add support for vertical overflow on Text components Updated player inventory idle animation Added interaction sounds for small loot containers (food, medical, tech, ammunition, etc) Updated generic loot crates with existing interaction sounds Hapis Island: Added 3 new monuments Jackhammer will hit hotspot every time without tap firing Torch despawns after 30 seconds Dropped backpacks will despawn after 30 seconds for rocks + torches Streamer mode will hide map name in server browser Can insert photos into mailbox `benchmark_demo {demo}` command to run the benchmark on different demos Can connect 'domain.com' without a port on the end Servers will no longer show the name of the custom map, only \"Custom Map\" if they are running one Optimized bulk loading assets from bundles Improved hide blood option Added hurt flash disable option m249 is slightly more aggressive HMLMG recoil is more aggressive Lowered HMLMG durability Increased HMLMG crafting cost Using scopes on weapons now increases their recoil Reduced blur/blood effects Accuracy bonus removed from the silencer Fixed first shot while ADSing sometimes playing the non-ADS fire animation Fixed missing deploy sound for combat knife Fixed missing sounds for smoke grenades and supply signals Fixed missing crosshairs and camera movement while first person spectating Fixed smoke grenade effects not working correctly with first person spectating Fixed horses not properly moving with elevators Fixed error with a particular configuration of items when making Low Grade at a Mixing Table Fixed missing localization on progress bar when Hold to dismount is enabled Fixed some deployable entities changing rotation every time they are selected on the belt (CUI) Fixed some skin id's not loading correctly (PR#37) Fixed some missing sfx on the Spray Can Fixed an exploit when changing water quality Fixed flashlights & laser needing to be turned on every time you equip them Fixed exploit to steal attachments out of shop fronts Fixed nodes & animals taking extra hits Hapis Island: Fixed berries not spawning Hapis Island: Fixed roadside spawns being overly scarce Hapis Island: Fixed numerous other reported issues.

Facepunch adjusted the bullet weighting as well. Approximately 20% of the bullets fired will land in the center of the spread, which means automatic weapons are now less useful at a distance - something Facepunch said should help encourage players to think about the best weapon for each situation. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-combat\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/rail-network\">The Rust rail network (partly) arrives in the April update</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/pets-system\">Looks like Rust is getting pets</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/february-update\">Rust's February update includes a big performance fix</a> ",

        "contents": "Combat Changes Today, we're releasing an update to the gunplay in Rust. The initial implementation of the weapons in Rust was done nearly 7 years ago and hasn't been significantly modified since it's inception. While these changes will be controversial, We believe these changes are necessary for the health of the game. Recoil The old recoil system in rust had some issues. It was loved by some, and hated by others. If you didn't have hundreds if not thousands of hours practicing the recoil in rust, Firing at people in the game would often feel like attempting to align two like poled magnets. Frustrating would be an understatement. Ultimately, being good at first person shooters and having the drop on someone wasn't good enough. If the other person had thousands of hours of training their aim you stood very little chance. This was fun for people who could spend thousands of hours training their aim, or morally bankrupt individuals who would choose to use scripts to gain an advantage. This was not fun for 99% of the population, and it's time for a change. Instead of pattern based recoil, we now implement a gradient based aim drift and inaccuracy for automatic weapons. That is to say, the longer you hold down the trigger, the more inaccurate the weapon becomes. It still takes skill to try and keep it centered on the target, but it is not the same with each burst. We've also updated aimcone (inaccuracy of bullets relative to where you are aiming )to use a weighted system, so that roughly 20% of the shots will land in the center. This means that automatic fire at a long range effectively decreases DPS. This encourages players to use the right weapons in the right situations and to improve their tactics and burst discipline. There should be less 200m beaming going on. What this has done is compressed the skill ceiling, and we think this is a good thing. Perfectly replicated recoil also meant that mouse scripts could be abused to put 30 rounds on target at 200m, every time. In addition to the aforementioned recoil changes, we went through and modernized some other elements of the 'first person shooter' experience. Sounds The most immediately noticeable change is the sound effects of most of the guns have been updated. This might take some getting used to but the quality has improved significantly. View models The View Models have had their dynamic animations updated. You'll notice the walking bob is much improved, as is the sway when looking left/right/up/down. It's a small change but helps to bring things into this decade. View Models also have a crisper punch back when firing, and they animate the main camera during reloads to emphasize the hand actions. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0211b1/viewmodel_movement_final_264_optimised.gif We've added head bob which is active when sprinting, it's a small touch but adds to the experience. You can turn this off in the options. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0211b1/headbob_264_optimised.gif All of these elements combined gives the weapons in rust a much cleaner and modern feeling. Hit punch & directional markers We also felt that there were some issues knowing where you were taking damage from, with large splotches of blood covering most of the screen during high damage encounters. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0211b1/hitpunch_264_optimised.gif We've changed this so that you now receive a smaller semicircle blood splat indicating the direction you took damage from, and a small amount of Screen Shake. Please note that silenced shots will not produce a damage indicator on the victims HUD. Hit cross We've added a visual hit indicator to accompany the sound you're all familiar with. Upon landing a successful hit onto another player or AI you'll now notice a hit marker cross briefly appearing. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0211b1/2SnYgEGPX0.gif Crosshair 10 years ago in legacy rust, people would tie dental floss to the top and sides of their monitor to create a crosshair in the center. Now everyone can simply enable one on their monitor or using third party software. Because of this we decided to add a crosshair to the game natively. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0211b1/crosshair_264_optimised.gif The crosshair will give you a rough idea of your accuracy based on the weapon you are holding and your stance. We'll be looking at crosshair customization options in the future, as well as specific crosshairs for different weapon types (melee/throwing, etc.) The crosshair can be disabled within the options menu if you hate it and third party crosshairs are allowed to be used. As always, this is a work in progress, We're going to review all the feedback and continue to make adjustments until we get this right. Everything is subject to change. Handmade LMG The handmade light machine gun is a new tier 3 craftable weapon, with high damage, a high rate of fire, and low accuracy but great at suppressing fire. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220531/hmlmg_01.jpg Crafting cost: 30 HQM, 1 rifle body, 2 metal springs and 3 gears. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0211b1/hmlmg_admire_264_optimised.gif Extended magazine The extended magazine is a new tier 2 weapon attachment which can be attached to most guns, providing an additional 25% ammo capacity. Crafting cost: 10 high quality metal. Mixing Table Ammo Hate standing around crafting ammo? You can now craft basic ammo types from the mixing table. Players are still required to have the ammo blueprint unlocked. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/31/3l75v1/RustClient_RlZoVfs9C8.png General QOL Rail Speed Boost - Horses on train tracks receive the same speed boost as on roads Coupled Car Display - The train's screen now shows the number of connected cars Land Mine - The Landmine is now scaled down Projectile Invalid - We've resolved a number of invalid projectiles whilst shooting under low ceiling Vehicle Sensitivity - Vehicles will now grab all mouse input leading to smoother control Compound Bow - Now loses less durability while held back An artifact of fixing vehicle sensitivity is players are used to the incorrect sensitivity. If your vehicle still feels difficult to control, please use the in-game options menu \"Vehicle sensitivity\" slider or the console command 'vehicle_sensitivity 0.8' (whatever value you want) to adjust to your liking. Launch Site AI Scientists have been added to the main building at the Launch Site monument. You can expect to see them patrolling the various floors as well as the rooftop area. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/30/4R78v1/RustClient_nI8P4VA6KN.jpg As with some of the other recently added Scientists, these ones can use healing items, too. Covered Work cart https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220530/workcart_covered_ext.jpg There's a new Work Cart train variant that will sometimes spawn on the above-ground rails, which has some more cover at the back. It's marginally slower than the other one, but otherwise behaves the same. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220530/workcart_covered_int.jpg In the near future, we have a proper new locomotive and more rail system updates on the way. Rail Sidings Expanding upon last month's rail network changes, this month we added closer rail sidings to sections of the rail network. Train spawns have been moved to those sidings in order to free up the main rail for traffic. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220602/rail_sidings_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/30/5B90C1/RustClient_uX4MHcKAkk.jpg Graffiti Pack The spray can has received an upgrade with the Graffiti Pack available in the Item store. Once purchased, you can choose from a variety of decals to spray in the world, as well as a free paint mode letting your creativity run wild. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220530/spraycan_decals.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220602/spraycan_free_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220602/spraycan_free_02.jpg Once purchased, hold Reload (R) to browse the decal options or to switch to free spray mode. While in free spray mode you can press Interact (E) to change spray size and Reload to change colour or switch back to decal mode. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220530/spraycan_decals_radial.jpg Found some graffiti on your base? Simply interact with the spray while holding something filled with water (Bota bag, bucket, bottle, etc) to clear the spray off. By default sprays should last three hours. There is a cap on how many sprays can be sprayed by a given player (25 at the moment) that we'll keep an eye on and raise if possible in future updates. Streamers should note that sprays sprayed by other players won't be visible when \"Hide Signs\" is active, although your own signs will still be visible. The reskin ability remains unchanged and is still available to everyone. Hapis Island For those of you who prefer more familiar surroundings, we're releasing the updated Hapis Island today, which has been AWOL ever since our last graphical update broke it. It should all be pretty familiar, with the exception that we decided to expand the desert in the south, and make it a proper desert this time. We've also added a few more secondary islands, along with some other small additions that I'll leave you to discover. Later on I expect we will add the new railroads to it as well, but for now we just wanted to get it out there. All blueprints on Facepunch Hapis Island servers will be wiped today. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220601/hapis_07.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220601/hapis_04.jpg Steam Point Store We're finally releasing the updated Rust Steam Point store today, Lewis and Paddy have been working hard on improving the quality and quantity of the store assets. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0211b1/steam_store_image.png We'll be expanding the collection over the coming months.

        "contents": "Above-Ground Trains We wanted to get some trains onto the above-ground rails this month. We have some more train content in the works, but for this initial release we're mostly reusing existing assets in order to provide something to try out until that content is ready. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220503/aboveground_workcart.jpg The above-ground Work Cart closely resembles the underground one, but now has coupling points at each end that can connect to other train cars. The bogies (also known as trucks - the wheel assemblies) have also been updated to rotate with the track more realistically. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220503/trains_snow.jpg We've taken some static train wagon models that we had and made them functional. These don't actually do anything special yet, but they spawn along with Work Carts on the new rail sidings and they can be shunted around. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220504/wagon_1.jpg The Work Cart train engines take low grade fuel as usual. Their target speeds at low/medium/high throttle are constant, but their acceleration and pulling ability are affected by gravity and how many couples wagons they're pulling as you'd expect. If your long train can't make it up a hill, it's possible to use multiple Work Carts in a multi-engine coupled setup for more power. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220503/coupling_closeup.jpg Coupling happens automatically when wagons collide at a low to moderate speed. High speed collisions will not couple, and may take damage instead. Uncoupling is manual - simply interact with the coupling point. Rail Network Branch Lines https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220503/rail_branchline.jpg The rail network has received secondary lines that branch off the main line and merge back onto it. This all happens entirely procedurally with no need for predetermined prefabs aside from the rail mesh itself, which results in a very flexible system that can cover a wide range of use cases as we expand the rail network in the future. For now, these branch lines are just where the trains are spawning. We will see how things work out and go from there. Rail and road foliage improvements https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220503/railroad_foliage.jpg The foliage / bushes spawning next to rails and roads have received some optimizations to eliminate their overhead as you move around the world. They now also spawn in larger clusters with varying coverage, resulting in some dense areas and some open areas, which allowed us to also reduce their total count as a performance improvement without having it affect the visuals too much. Zipline Improvements https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220405/powerline_01.jpg Ziplines seemed to be well used last month, but there were too many cases of ziplines failing to connect, leading to zipline platforms with no connections. I've improved the procedural generation process this month in a few different ways. Ziplines are now better at routing around obstacles, allowing ziplines to go via 2 separate mid-points before arriving at their destination. I also added zipline arrival points at Sewer Branch, Stables, Lighthouse and Dome. All of these changes combined have improved the number of ziplines on procedural maps by about 40%. Death screen Improvements https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220503/killedbychicken.png The death screen has been improved this month with many NPC's getting custom icons and proper translations. We've also improved how we show your death information if you suicide while downed. Previously doing this would result in the death screen showing your death as a suicide, preventing you from seeing the name and weapon of your attacker. This is now fixed and you will see the last attack details even if you suicide while downed. Client Performance Client performance was identified as a growing issue last month so we all put some time aside to try and improve performance this month. We've made good progress in some key areas: Fixed a regression introduced last month that was generating a lot of garbage and causing stutters. This was deemed high enough priority that we released it in a hotfix early in the month. Identified a bug that was preventing lasers and some other heavy systems from budgeting their performance correctly (This was also affecting server performance). Significantly reduced network traffic from planters and plants getting watered by sprinklers. Performance is always a high priority for us and we've got more improvements being worked on for future updates. General QOL SAM Site Damage - SAM Site can no longer be damaged by bullet type damage Junkpile scientists - NPCs have returned to junkpile spawns Community UI Improvements We've integrated several pull requests from the Community UI Github project this month, bringing improvements like blocking keyboard input while in text boxes, better item and skin rendering as well as fixing a handful of bugs. Thank you to Ailtop, Jake-Rich, shooter46 and Mughisi for the contributions. We have some more improvements to this system in the works, specifically to improve rendering and network performance on rapidly updated UI displays. Hapis Island Some of you have been waiting for Hapis Island to return after last year's graphical overhaul broke it. This is just a little heads-up to tell you that we are aiming for it to finally go live again in next month's patch. Twitch Drops Starting from today till May 12th 23:59UTC Twitch drops are enabled for Rust Twitch streamers.

The top 3 players are given special eggs as a reward. These eggs can be cracked open for various types of loot ranging from scrap all the way up to an M249! https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/04/14/269931/hunt.jpg If you don't make the podium, that's okay. The painted eggs you collect can be upgraded to Bronze eggs once you collect 10. If you collect 10 bronze eggs then you can upgrade to a silver egg, eventually all the way to gold! There are various items available to help you during your hunt. The Easter Basket will allow instant pickup of eggs and the Bunny Onesie and Ears will provide you with an advantage via Egg Vision.

Please report any weird looking areas you might encounter. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220404/railnetwork_procedural_02.jpg In the near future, you can expect driveable above-ground trains. Powerline Ziplines Powerlines have had an upgrade this month, with new platforms and ziplines now appearing across procedurally generated maps. To access the zipline you'll need to climb to the top of the new platforms that are attached to some powerlines. Once at the top, you can use the zipline to travel to another platform further along the chain of powerlines or to nearby monuments. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220405/powerline_02.jpg You can speed up on the line by holding forward and jump off at anytime with the jump key (just be careful of the drop!). Colliding with anything solid while on the line will also knock you off the line, this includes trees, players and vehicles, so use with care. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220405/zipline_01.jpg We'll be improving the generation of these over time to connect more monuments, as well as exploring ways for players to place their own ziplines in the future. Achievements Since launching out of early access in 2018 Rust's achievements have served as a way for new players to learn the basics of the game. Unfortunately they haven't kept up with the amount of new content added to the game every month so we've made a set of 18 new achievements to earn. As usual, achievements can only be earned on official servers. https://files.facepunch.com/lewis/1b0511b1/Achievements.png Monument Lighting Continued We have continued improving the lighting setup for our monuments. This month we have focused mainly on the monuments such as; Lighthouse, Fishing Villages, Stables, Excavator, Arctic Research Base and Airfield. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220405/monumentlighting_fishingvillage_01.jpg The degree of improvements varies depending on the monument. Some of the newer monuments like Fishing Villages, Stables and Excavator received only minor updates. This includes changes such as adding darkening volumes to interiors, adding new ambient lights and enabling interior lights during the daytime. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220405/monumentlighting_excavator_01.jpg Other monuments like Lighthouse and Arctic Research base received more extensive upgrades, which includes a whole lot of new lights, that will make the monuments significantly brighter during nighttime and more atmospheric during daytime. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220405/monumentlighting_arcticlabs_03.jpg The monument that received the biggest upgrade this month is the Airfield. Here we have added not only new lights and darkening volumes, but also tweaked some materials and added a lot of new prop dressing to bring it to the same level of quality of our newer monuments. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220405/monumentlighting_airfield_02.jpg General QOL Landmine Update - The landmine has received a visual refresh Loading Background - Loading screen image will now alternate between images Magnet Crane - Further improvements to the junkyard magnet crane handling https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/04/05/0t48A1/RustClient_8lsov8RD1y.jpg Steam Networking We have updated Steam Networking to the latest version, which comes with a number of important performance improvements. It's still disabled by default, but we will run some tests on various official servers to provide feedback to Valve regarding any potential issues. In the medium term, we hope to switch all servers to Steam Networking by default. Official server analytics Balancing Rust can be a daunting prospect given the wide variety of play styles and content. With that in mind, this month we're releasing our first pass of server analytics for official servers so we can start to gather some data about how you play Rust. While this will be invisible to you, we're hoping to use this data to better allocate resources to parts of the game that need work as well as identifying balance issues. If you're playing on an official server, thanks in advance for helping us out. We'll be sure to share any interesting stats that pop up. Twitch Rivals On April 14th at 8:00 pm GMT a team of 80 well known Twitch creators with 40 players from North America (team Disguised Toast) will face off against a team of 40 players from Europe and Latin America (team Alexby11) in this massive global Rust competition, taking place over 48 hours with a prize pool worth $100k. During the Twitch Rivals event, Rust Twitch drops will be enabled for 3 days from selected participating channels, well-known streamers such as hJune, xQcOW, Welyn, Silithur, BaboAbe, sykkuno, Ray__C, LakshartNia and of course the team captains Alexby11 and Disguised Toast. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/04/07/9W36x1/twitch-drops-rivals-blog_compressed.jpg Over the course of the 48 hours, teams will build up their bases and supplies. During this time, teams can gain access to additional resources by getting kills, completing objectives, and claiming crate drops. The final hour of the competition will be an all-out battle, as both teams try to raid the opposing base. The team that collects the most dog tags will win. We'd like to thank Rustoria for working with us and Twitch to make this event possible. Learn more at twitch.facepunch.com Easter Event On April 14th at 19:00 BST / 18:00 UTC / 14:00 EST we'll be releasing an optional update to enable this year's Easter egg hunt event, more details to follow in an upcoming blog on the 14th.

        "contents": "Monument Lighting This month we’ve made visual improvements to some of our older monuments to get them more consistent with the quality of our new content. This includes changes such as adding darkening volumes to interiors to prevent them from becoming too bright during the day, adding new lights and effects, tweaking existing lighting and other minor visual improvements. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220302/launchsite_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220302/launchsite_03.jpg As a result, the interiors should feel much darker and more atmospheric. The monuments that we’ve changed so far are the Supermarket, Oxum's Gas Station, Bandit Camp and Launch Site and we plan to improve more of them over time. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220302/supermarket.jpg Soundtrack Release This month we're really excited to announce the release of Rust's official soundtrack - available now on Steam, music streaming services and a handful of digital stores. This initial release (Volume 1) is comprised of 29 tracks clocking in around 1 hour and 45 minutes of music. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701720/Rust_Soundtrack/ Alex originally wrote a lot of these songs for our update videos but he's been expanding them into more fleshed out, standalone pieces of music. There's also some songs he has written to fit the occasional calm moment in game that you won't have heard at all yet. Alex is in the process of getting these songs chopped up and implemented to playback dynamically in game as well. Around half of the new tracks are ready in this update, and the rest should follow shortly. Listen now on your favourite music streaming platforms, including: Spotify Apple Music Bandcamp YouTube Music Amazon Music And many more digital music stores! Improved vehicle body visuals https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220228/hands_driving_car.jpg This month we've been exploring new ways to improve the visual experience when driving vehicles. While we initially explored dedicated viewmodels for vehicles (floating arms in front of the camera) we settled on using the full body mesh with tweaked hand logic. You can see this most obviously on the Snowmobile, the driver seat of Modular Cars and the Workcart, while it's visible but less obvious on the Minicopter and Scrap Transport Helicopter. This approach allows us to highlight the hand IK on vehicles like snowmobiles and cars so you can see your arms turning. There's also some subtle camera movement if the player model leans or moves (like on the Snowmobile). https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220228/hands_driving_snowmobile.jpg Magnet Crane Cleanup https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210506/revamp_junkyard_08.jpg We looked at the junkyard magnet crane this month to see if some bugs and the general feel of it could be improved. It's now a bit more stable to drive, and old issues like the driver not quite visually syncing up with the cabin as it rotates are fixed. Another concern with the crane was that with its controls being pretty complex, it was easy to burn through your fuel just learning them. To combat that, we've reduced the fuel it uses at idle by 80%, and the maximum fuel it uses when not holding anything by 25%. So if you're just practicing moving the magnet arm and rotating the cabin, your fuel will only be being consumed at 20% of the rate it was before. Snowmobile Cleanup We added some small final touches to the snowmobiles. Most were minor bug fixes, but an obvious one is that animations are improved, with the driver now getting visually bumped around at times, and showing an idle animation cycle. Audio is improved as well, with the snowmobile revving more realistically when driving up hills. For game balance, the arctic base snowmobile no longer comes loaded with any fuel. World Model Update There are some assets that need world models and some that needed refreshing so towards the end of last year Tom completed a number of new and updated world models, these are now in-game! https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/02/28/3R8071/preview-lightbox-worldmodels.jpg General QOL Slower Car Decay - Cars decay 4x slower when left outdoors Alt Look Restrictions - Restrict how far up a player can look with alt look while looking down Water catchers & barrels now decay - Should lower the number of catchers and barrels that are left outside Large Furnace Heat - Large furnaces now provide comfort and heat Monument Loot Hiding - Monument loot no longer spawns when players are within 20m of the spawn point Phantom Footsteps- We believe we've now fixed a long standing issue of hearing phantom footsteps Night Vision and post fixes https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b0311b1/nvgmar22.png We've had reports of the NVG effect being blown out for a while. When we looked into it, we realised that it only looks incorrect on procedural maps. After a lot of digging, we found that there was a post process volume placed inside one of moon pools set to global rather than local erroneously. This means that it was being applied all of the time and messing with exposure settings. This also means that it's had an effect on the overall exposure of the game for while also, although this has been a bit less apparent than with NVG. Search and loading screen update The loading screen was long overdue for a revamp, you'll now see server stats and a more clear tooltip sections while loading into the server of choice. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/02/28/8R5281/RustClient_5biwGmIIHo.jpg In a future update, the background image will randomly change through a preselected gallery on each load. Additionally, we've added support for tag filtering to the server browser to make finding servers of interest easier. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/02/28/6U55j1/RustClient_evh9RpdlVx.jpg Changelog Added support for tag filtering to the server browser Added new in game music Added 14 new world models Updated loading screen Improved arm and body visuals on some vehicles Improved 3rd person keycard animation Can no longer reskin doors that are open Can now switch to and from Ice Rifle skin regardless of ammo or attachments Added support for infinitely scrolling MIDI knob convar bindings (see MidiConvar.BindKnobRelative convar) Restricted how far a player can alt look up when looking down IO Entities can now decay (fixes Water Barrel, Water Catcher, Above Ground Pool, Boom box, CCTV, Connected Speaker, Counter, Disco Floor, Sprinkler, Wind Mill, Car Lift, Paddling Pool, SAM turret, Search Light, Smart Alarm, Solar Panel, Sound Lights, Telephone, Water Pump not decaying when placed outside of a base) Removed slot 8 input bind Renamed slot 7 input bind to \"Holster Item\" When opening the inventory the currently equipped belt item will automatically be selected Modular cars take 4x longer to decay Increased local player voice volume when recording a cassette Junkyard magnet crane is more stable to drive Junkyard magnet crane now uses 80% less fuel when not driving around, and 25% less fuel when not carrying anything on its magnet Added Always Sprint to the game options.

While Rust is a bit of a different kettle of fish to those <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-rpgs-pc\">RPGs</a>, there's no reason to think pets wouldn't make the game that bit fuller - and it sounds like they are indeed coming to Facepunch's survival sandbox. Trusty Rust YouTuber Shadowfrax has shared another update on what's going on - or rather, what seems to be going on - in the world of Rust. In the clip below, 'frax explains that in scanning the game's commits log, he's spotted an exciting hint suggesting that pets could potentially be in progress for the game. The video notes that there's a new branch called 'pets' and highlights an entry in the log (currently found <a href=\"https://commits.facepunch.com/?p=4\">on page four</a> as of writing) that notes a \"bunch of initial pet system refactoring work\". Hmm. The YouTuber indicates that the new pet system could build on the one Facepunch introduced in <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252490/view/4733838539436271870\">last year's Halloween update</a> for Frankenstein's monster. This fella would \"follow you around the map, defend you if attacked, and help slay foes you wish to attack\", so it sounds like the pet system could follow a similar blueprint. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/pets-system\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/february-update\">Rust's February update includes a big performance fix</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/arctic-update-hazmat-skin\">Rust gets a spiffy new hazmat suit in next week's Arctic update</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sales-arctic-update\">Rust has sold over 12.4 million copies and is getting polar bears soon</a> ",

        "contents": "This months update brings a new monument, the Arctic Research Base, snowmobiles, polar bears, AI update, spray can item, QOL changes and much more! Arctic Research Base In this month's update, a new monument has been added. The Arctic Research Base will spawn exclusively in the arctic biome. Those who are not afraid of the cold winds and frigid temperatures will be able to explore various lab modules and buildings scattered around the base. You will find there a bunch of loot to scavenge, or take a little break to warm yourself next to an electric heater. But most importantly, the Arctic Research Base will spawn snowmobiles. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220202/arcticbase_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220202/arcticbase_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220202/arcticbase_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220202/arcticbase_04.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220202/arcticbase_05.jpg Keep in mind, however, that scientists won't appreciate your presence and will shoot you on sight. Snowmobiles We've added a new vehicle that's only available through a puzzle at the Arctic Base: Snowmobiles. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220131/snowmobile_base.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220131/snowmobile_storage.jpg Snowmobiles take low-grade fuel and have a small storage container on the back. They're fast on snow and sand and slow everywhere else. They drive smoothly even over rough terrain but take some skill to control well. When you find one in an Arctic Base, it'll have 20 fuel ready to go. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220131/snowmobile_shooting.jpg A passenger can sit on the back and face any direction, allowing them to shoot to the sides or even directly behind. POLAR BEARS You'll now be encountering the polar bear in the arctic biome. The polar bear is the strongest and most hostile animal in the world but yields extra resources when harvested compared to its bear cousin. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220131/polarbear.jpg The regular bear will no longer be spawning in the arctic and receive slight health and hostile reduction. AI Update We've added the ability for scientists to use medical items to heal themselves. Scientists have a chance of spawning with the ability. We've initially enabled this at the new arctic research station and we'll add it to other areas of the game soon. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220128/arcticscientists.jpg We've also made some timing, balance and movement tweaks to the scientist AI. Spraycan The Spraycan is a new default tool that can be crafted for 100 metal fragments that allows you to reskin items that have been deployed in the world. Instead of having to pick up items and use a Repair Bench, you can simply use RMB while holding a Spraycan to open up the skin options and select a new skin. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220131/spraycans_box.jpg You may have seen some further spray functionality on the Staging branch this month, however these features had some issues so we've had to delay them for a future update. The spraycan can not be used while building blocked. General QOL Jarryd spent some time working on some more General QOL features this month, see the changelog for further info or check out some highlights below: Tool Cupboard Storage - Added slots for tools in the Tool Cupboard Tech Tree Improvements - Show total cost to reach an unlock and show how much scrap is being held Auto Walk and Toggle Crouch - Native auto walk keybind and toggle crouch option SAM Defender Mode - Added Defender mode to SAM site to defend against MLRS rockets only Patrol Helicopter on Map - Show the Patrol Helicopter's current position on the Map Mute Menu - Manage your muted players with a new UI Wounded Player Looting - No longer kicked out of the inventory when looting wounded players Recent Contacts - Contacts can now be sorted by recently seen Tech Tree Unlocking - Added the ability to click and hold to unlock items in tech trees Wounded Team Members - Wounded team members now appear as orange when wounded in the team UI Performance Recently it came to our attention that performance had degraded more significantly than it probably should have based on the recent updates to the game. Whilst attempting to confirm this, we noticed that the framerate would predictably dip significantly for no apparent reason, then recover. The higher your base framerate was, the more severe these dips would appear to be. After doing a bunch of profiling, we noticed that there were some significant stalls on the render thread and our tree impostor system was most likely the cause of the issue, even though the population had only been tweaked very slightly recently. With the fix, framerates should be a lot more consistent again (as long as what's being rendered is consistent) and should overall be slightly higher in general, particularly in areas with a lot of bushes and trees like Bandit Camp. Permanent Store - Arctic Pack This month we're introducing a new addition to Rust's permanent store, the Arctic Pack. The Arctic Pack contains 3 items which can be seen below. Arctic Suit The Arctic Suit is a hazmat skin that can be applied while crafting the hazmat or skinned using the repair table. The arctic suit offers slightly higher cold protection but at the cost of lower radiation, melee and explosive protection. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220201/arctichazmat_hero.jpg Tomaha Snowmobile The Tomaha snowmobile cosmetic skin can be applied by using the spray can on the snowmobile which can be found at the arctic research station monument. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220131/tomaha_arcticsuit.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220131/tomaha_arcticsuit.jpg ICE ASSAULT RIFLE The Ice Assault Rifle is a cosmetic skin for the assault rifle. The skin can be applied when crafting the assault rifle or added by placing the weapon inside the repair table. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220203/iceassaultrifle.jpg Twitch Drops Starting from today till February 11th 23:59UTC Twitch drops are enabled for Rust Twitch streamers. You can earn special and unique skins simply by watching your favourite Rust Twitch streamers. https://files.facepunch.com/lewis/1b3111b1/twitch-drops-round-13-blog.png During the final 24 hours of the Rust Twitch drop campaign, all drops will be moved to general.

Merch Update Our friends at For Fans By Fans have released a new drop of Rust merchandise - we've got a new Rust logo snapback hat, a heat sensitive mug, new stickers and posters as well as a No Mercy mousepad (inspired by the legendary No Mercy skins).

First off, throughout the Lunar New Year celebration, everyone will be able to craft a set of throw-able firecrackers to make a racket. Traditionally set off to scare away evil spirits, many people would set them off when opening the front door before they went out. We somehow doubt these will scare off a dedicated door camper but you can try! Tiger Mask To celebrate the year of the tiger we have created a beautiful Tiger Mask with jiggling chin tassles. Similar to last years Ox Mask, it replaces the wolf headdress. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/01/28/7x2521/GroupShot_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/01/28/7T82o1/TigerMask_02.jpg The Tiger Mask can be purchased on the Rust item store. Sky Lantern New this year is the Sky Lantern. When ignited with a lit torch the sky lantern will take to the skies and is able to carry one item in the direction you're looking. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/01/28/1O72u1/sky_lantern_02.jpg Available to be crafted in five colours: white, purple, green, red and orange. The Sky Lantern can be purchased at the Rust item store. New Year Items In addition to this year's tiger mask and sky lantern, we’ve added items back from prior years sale to the item store, the Dragon Door Knocker and the Chinese Lantern.

It'll introduce a new cold-weather skin for the hazmat suit to the permanent store, and while it'll cost the same to craft as other hazmat suit variants, it has some noticeably different attributes. The arctic update will arrive February 3. First, however, is a patch due out today, January 28. This one adds some new Lunar New Year items, including a snarling traditional tiger mask and a sky lantern. The sky lantern is a floating container - you can put an item in it, then swat it with a lit torch to send it up and away into the evening sky. As venerable Rust YouTuber ShadowFrax explains, it'll travel a short distance, and fall if it's shot, carrying whatever you put in it with it. The new arctic hazmat suit is the first hazmat skin to offer a unique set of stats. Its big benefit is 40% cold protection, which is significantly more than the 8% provided by the default hazmat suit and other variants. It does have a bit less bite, 10% less protection from radiation, and a 2% reduction in damage protection from explosions. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/arctic-update-hazmat-skin\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sales-arctic-update\">Rust has sold over 12.4 million copies and is getting polar bears soon</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-december-2021\">Rust gets \"massive\" excavator changes and a Christmas bash this month</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/server-transitions\">Here's our first peek at how Rust's server transitions could work</a> ",

        "contents": "Thanks to everyone that nominated Rust for the Labor of Love award. We have now reached the final stage of voting so we need your votes once again! You can do so now by clicking the vote button above and to show our appreciation if Rust wins the Labor of Love Steam award, we'll give you (the community) control on designing a new deployable item in the game! If you haven't already voted we'd like to show you in some words, pictures and videos why Rust is a Labor of Love for us! Rust came to life because Helk and Garry felt there was something missing in the games they were playing and set about making a game they could play how they wanted to play it, Rust was started in Unity Engine 4 and was playable in a web browser and keys were sold in a dutch auction and as the player base grew the game was made into a standalone version and released on Steam in early access on 11th December 2013. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/59dc97fe534c22706b625619cb2ec6867553d321.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/6b3c421e9ebea4e650be93209e4015152dd95201.jpg Work continued at pace, new features being added like the research bench, a new water system along with a new sky system, bugs being squashed, some quite serious. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/8789d32a243e7f3eeb44e77e121241cc71bfa675.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/8dbabe70ef611cb0d2f01165215f6c6d6f50ec87.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/9c19b9d0b422aff625d22fe1169a96f370e098a9.jpg It was decided we needed a better way of telling guys what we were doing in the background so weekly updates were started and with that came the Friday blog in March 2014. Not long after this, we realised Rust was getting too big for Unity 4 and we were getting seriously limited on how much we could grow which would impact on how you could play and enjoy the game, it was decided we would switch to Unity 5 and while you continued to enjoy playing the game we would completely rebuild the game from scratch. It was a huge decision and task but made Rust what it is today. In July 2014 we started the Community Blog which would showcase what our players and creators were doing in Rust from builds and raids to erm ... rituals to Garry. By the end of 2014 the groundwork for the Rust reboot was set, instead of the same map on every server, the island could be generated procedurally giving every server it's own identity. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/7bf650d68553ed71f62a7982c9f22f29eca5167d.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/36ef7bcc184b65e9b6b062717a1a18ee88873b96.jpg Custom weapons were designed and modelled to give more of a hand crafted feel {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/1a58bd313a9ba49cf8b91a4d3ef2eceb44e973f7.png New tools were created to help you get the resources you need, including the iconic rock and the hatchet. Useful for farming the animals that were added for food and more resources. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/76cd74f3551472a77ab7fcbbea8cbdac2c0dd2c2.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/5f84d74b721df65827401a9ff68afb207d312935.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/062fa295971a2eaa4d61c1c67bbbab66cfdbd14e.jpg Having resources meant you were going to need a nice base to keep them in and the building system came to life, not only could you create the design you wanted with new building pieces you could now upgrade it to different materials to give your base more strength. This progressed from late 2014 into early 2015 as a system you might recognise today and you could also use a Tool Cupboard to give ownership to your base! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/0cd7bfb5e406456f04a2bae953eb181f2061264e.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/111d024f94c1259c32d8b9c34ead351bb9f8e650.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/225c260713e2a3c9657b83dbf25181bce3f68d2a.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/400dfccde4b26804edf59b5aee95e17469c88ec2.jpg 2015 continued to build up on the groundwork set and the islands got more procedural features like roads and power lines between the monuments. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/26940a21ad029e81ebfdbf9bfc604faaab415348.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/d20d177fe4242bcd178065a6c7bdb257f2b6c637.png Everyone had the same male character so It was decided we should add more varieties and also a female character which could all be randomly assigned to players, we also gave them armour for protection from each other. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/a5b23ef7d070f9b9fab268f32fb9018404721321.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/5ed68a11766d9bbc7cec4d8ab61e4614c8bcf5ed.jpg By the end of the year we had added Beartraps, Assualt Rifle, Pump Shotgun, C4, Attack Helicopter, Ambient Sound, Gibbing, Decay, Paintable Signs, Rocket Launcher, Monuments, Assigning sleeping bag to friends, Repair Bench, Guitars, Building Upgrades, Player skin colours, Wounding, Hapis Island, Rivers, Research Table, Barricades, Bullet Penetration, Large Furnace, Loot, Decals, Ammo Counters, Blueprints System, Grenades, Horses, Landmines, Water Catchers, Crossbow, Code Locks, Draw-able Maps, SMG, Supply Signal, Floor Spikes, Language Selector, Pistol, Ladders, Throwables, Pickable arrows/spears and load of bug fixes, optimizations and visual improvements. Rust also got it's first Christmas Event! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/168abbdccf001553db7ce61c5b26db50473647b1.jpg Shortly after, we realised weekly updates weren't really ideal for us, we'd lose a day of development time preparing the update and dealing with any issues that came up post update, this downtime would be less noticeable over the period of a month so the switch was made to the monthly updates you know today and have been happening since. As you can see, the first two years kept us really busy, skip forward and the last two years have been just as busy pushing out content month after month. Here are some of the highlights and the associated update trailers! Instruments DLC - For our first DLC we gave you the opportunity to get together and jam with your friends or annoy your neighbours. Modular Turrets - Since it's creation, the turret came with an included assault rifle, we gave you the option to add any weapon (or trumpet) to your turrets! Farming 2.0 - Brought you new ways of growing your own crops with automated watering systems to keep you supplied with food and cloth. Rust+ - The companion app for your phones to help you organise your Team, control your electronics and receive notifications from in game. Modular Vehicles - A new way of getting around the Rust island in a variety of setups depending on your needs, Sunburn DLC - Our 2nd DLC full of summer essentials from lazing on a rubber ring in your pool to water pistol fights on the beaches. Tech Tree - We gave you the option of unlocking blueprints on a linear path rather than having to find each blueprint in loot During the Christmas holiday period of 2020 Rust received a massive boost when we were joined by a variety of well known streamers and content creators with events being run by OfflineTV and their friends and Egoland and their friends who spotlighted Rust to viewers who had probably never seen Rust or thought of joining us and gave us a huge boost with record player counts and viewership. This gave the developers a boost and spurred us on to bring more content for players to enjoy. Freight Transit Line - A new underground system throughout the whole map which gives you another option for getting around the monuments. Voiceprops DLC - Our latest DLC for recording and playback of voice and audio to making your own in game disco. Underwater - Another new way to explore the environment, submarines to transport you around and underwater labs to explore and loot! We hope this gives some insight into why we bring updates month after month to bring more content and new ways for you, our players to enjoy Rust and on behalf of everyone at Facepunch Studios we'd like to wish you a Happy Holidays and we look forward to what 2022 will bring!

        "contents": "Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! From everyone at Facepunch, we'd all like to wish you a Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone! The Christmas Event is once again live! If you haven't been around for this before, here's what you can expect: Every once in a while you will hear the sound of jingle bells. Run outside and look for a gift! Two gifts are spawned per player, in a radius of about 40m from where you are standing. Run up and bash it open to receive your Christmas presents. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. If you have enough small presents stashed, you can \"trade up\" to a medium or large. The contents of each present vary, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and candy. We've also added wrapping paper allowing you to wrap up items as gifts to other players, perhaps sold in your vending machine... https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_giftboxes.jpg Once again, you will be able to find Santa hats and reindeer antlers, both of which can be worn and provide a decent amount of protection. There’s also a lickable candy cane club, and two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring the stocking will fill up with loot. The larger stocking has a higher chance for better items and both last around 5-10 refills. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_santasleigh.jpg Have fun! New Festive Items Snowman Hat Get in the festive Rustmas spirit with the new Snowman hat!

The <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival game's</a> December offering ushers in a bunch of varied changes and content, with \"massive\" production buffs for the excavator, a revamped first-person spectator mode, some AI improvements, and more. Plus, there's a Christmas-themed bash coming up soon. Facepunch has revealed that the Excavator monument - which can be used to produce useful materials - has received some big ol' buffs that mean one unit of diesel fuel will now power the contraption for two minutes and produce a high new volume of yields. These are 100 high-quality metal parts, 2,000 sulfur ore, 10,000 stone, and 5,000 metal fragments, which is a pretty big climb from the <a href=\"https://rust.fandom.com/wiki/Large_Excavator_Pit\">previous quantities</a>. The newly revamped first-person spectator mode, meanwhile, should give players looking to catch a look at the action a \"more pleasant experience\". The devs reveal that they've looked to mimic the perspective of actual gameplay as much as possible to improve the mode, with support for \"proper weapon view models, better camera perspectives, alt looking, and much of the standard game HUD like the compass, vitals, hotbar and, teams\". <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-december-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/server-transitions\">Here's our first peek at how Rust's server transitions could work</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/permanent-store-items-skins\">Rust gets a permanent in-game store with \"premium\" cosmetics</a> ",

        "contents": "Excavator https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/excavator_wide.jpg The excavator has received a massive production buff. One unit of Diesel fuel will run the excavator for 2 minutes and produce any one of the following yields : 100 HQM 2000 Sulfur Ore 10,000 Stone 5000 Metal Fragments https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/excavator_belt.jpg In addition to this, a terminal can now be found next to the generator. While the excavator is powered on, the communications relay will charge. Once it has charged for 100% (10 minutes or 5 diesel by default) you can use the terminal to request airdrop supplies to the excavator. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/excavator_termal.jpg Hopefully these changes to the excavator will see it be a more viable and widely used monument. Excavator Tummy Tuck https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/excavator_aerial.jpg We have frequently heard from you about the limited real estate left available on some map seeds. One of the main complaint was about the Giant Excavator monument. It was meant to impress by its sheer scale when first introduced, but we have come to recognize that it does sacrifice a good amount of play area. As a result I have remodelled the terrain surroundings of the monument, and shrunk the overall surface it consumes by a good 30%. First Person Spectate https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/rock_fp.jpg Spectating players should be a more pleasant experience this month with a revamped First Person Spectate mode. We've tried to mimic the actual gameplay perspective as much as possible, supporting proper weapon viewmodels, better camera perspectives, alt looking and much of the standard game HUD like the compass, vitals, hotbar and teams. This new mode will automatically activate when spectating in first person, it also works when playing back demos. I've also added a button to easily spectate a specific player in the admin UI tab. Hopefully this will make spectating players more enjoyable for admins, as well as providing some new cinematic options for demo users. Improvements & Fixes Highlights NVG Clarity -Reduced NGV grain and overlay intensity Vehicle Animal Attacks - Animals will no longer attack players inside cars MP5 Costs - MP5 research cost increased and drop rates lowered MLRS Barrage - MLRS rockets cluster less towards the centre Compound Bow Changes - Compound Bow now unlocked from Tier 1 Workbench Tech Tree T2 - Electricity and car parts now on a separate branch Check out the changelog for more changes. AI Cleanup & Tweaks https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/scientists_warehouse.jpg This month we were finally able to remove two more of the various AI setups that we've had in Rust over the years. Now pretty much everything is running on one system. This meant we were able to remove a ton of code and prefabs - this is better for maintenance and long term development of the AI. There should also be some slight performance improvements. We've also made some tweaks to the animal and human AI, such as fixing some annoyances and increasing responsiveness. There's more improvements to come in this area now that the bigger features are finished. Forest Density https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211201/forest_density.jpg Since the World Revamp update, we've received a lot of player feedback surrounding forest density, the aim of world revamp update was to upgrade Rust's visuals without sacrificing performance/FPS. While balancing performance to visual fidelity we were conservative with foliage density values while trying to match them closely as possible to the prior procedural generation. Today we've slightly but noticeably increased forest density, we hope this will bring back some much-needed forest density while keeping performance under control. Blueprint Wipe With today's update, all servers will have their Blueprints wiped and player progress reset. https://files.facepunch.com/errn/1b2611b1/bpwipe_12-2021_poster_4k.jpg Permanent Store Launched If you missed our announcement last month then here is a summary of the launch of Rust's permanent in-game store. The new store will feature premium cosmetic items and skins. We kicked things off by releasing the Nomad skin. The Nomad skin is a hazmat reskin replacement that can be applied when crafting the hazmat suit or by placing the hazmat suit into a repair bench. Additionally, we've also launched some new items such as new lights, underwear and even a used sofa. Full details of the permanent store can be found HERE Rust's 8th Birthday Rust turns 8 this month and we’ll be celebrating for one day only on 11th December with a birthday cake and hats. In the near future, we plan to talk more about how the last year has gone and what we learned as well as some information about how Rust has performed. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211202/rust_bday08.jpg Facepunch Servers We've retired the following Facepunch servers: EU 11 EU 12 EU 13 EU 14 EU 15 EU 16 EU 17 EU 18 EU Small 9 EU Small 10 EU Softcore 7 EU Softcore 8 EU Softcore 9 US Softcore 3 US Soft core 4 US East 5 US East 6 US Small 4 Additionally, some Facepunch servers have had their max player limit increased and EU1 has changed to a new IP address. Christmas Update On December 16th at 19:00GMT / 14:00 EST we'll be releasing a mandatory server and client update to enable the Xmas event and some festive features! Changelog Enhanced First Person spectate Excavator supply drops Excavator 2.5x more yeild Failed code lock entry for after 8 failed attempts now locks out user for 15mins Exposed bear, boar and chicken populations in Server Admin UI Increased human AI line-of-sight responsiveness. Compound Bow moved to T1 Techtree Compound Bow loses condition while drawn back Reduced NVG grain and overlay intensity Fish can now be sold for more scrap at fishing village exchange MP5 NPC drop chance lowered Watch tower decay, health and craft time higher Table item craft no longer need metal fragments Higher forest density TechTree T2 electricity and car parts now on a separate branch Increased the target hit area, and rockets cluster less towards the centre. In general it's now better for larger bases vs. precision targeting. Increased the MLRS UI map zoom a little to make targeting easier (remember that it will show a marker you've placed as well). The MLRS UI now supports characters from other languages. The MLRS rocket explosion ground effect now plays at the true hit point rather than directly below the main explosion. Reduced MLRS rocket world model size and mass to 25% of actual size and mass. No more giant rockets. Fixed skull rock skin missing sound effects Fixed case where ammo would be lost when an auto turret reloads a weapon Animals no longer continue to attack player corpses. Animals will no longer attack players inside modular vehicles. Fixed desync exploit abused by some private hack providers Fixed gap exploit abused by a large number of hacks Fixed missions UI enabled on first open and requiring double click to close Fixed some mission typos, incorrect text and wrong reward amounts Fixed MLRS rocket backfire effects flashing on when entering LOD range. Fixed cassette recorders not sticking correctly to MLRS moving parts. Fixed SAM sites not shooting hot air balloons anymore The info panel for rocket ammo now shows their true maximum range instead of a semi-fabricated one. Fixed LOD issues on the excavator ",

The idea behind this, as the 'frax explained at the time, is that players will be able to \"move between servers with an as-yet-to-be-confirmed quantity of gear and items\" by hopping into a seaworthy craft and venturing out to maps' edges. Now, we've got our first peep at what this might look like in action. \"I'm excited to show you some actual server transitioning - yes, me boldly going between servers,\" Shadowfrax says in his latest clip covering Rust's work-in-progress features (below). The YouTuber got to test the feature \"on a limited scale\" as it functions right now, with two servers linked up in his dummy-run example. You can see the other from your current server as depicted by a rough outline of an island in the distance, across the sea. If you hop in a boat and zoom towards the island you'll soon get a pop-up message as you near the map's edges, which tells you how much further you need to travel before you'll hit the other server. If you keep on barrelling in that direction, you'll then connect to the other server. So, it sounds like it'll be easy-peasy to use. \"It appears that right now there's no restriction on what you can take with you in your inventory,\" Shadowfrax also says, though only boats let you server-hop in at the moment. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/server-transitions\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/permanent-store-items-skins\">Rust gets a permanent in-game store with \"premium\" cosmetics</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/november-update-rocket-launching-system\">Rust's November update brings desert bases and new rocket launching system</a> ",

The <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival game</a> has now got a permanent in-game store featuring items and skins that are always available to buy - and Facepunch has released a new batch of stuff to kick things off, too. \"We've found over the years that players really value being able to choose different skins and items to enjoy Rust, like the Spacesuit hazmat skin, or fun seasonal stuff like Christmas lights or fireworks packs,\" the studio announces in a news post. \"We're also very aware that Rust has grown in popularity but many new players won't be aware that they have these options.\" The idea behind launching this new range of evergreen offerings is to have a core range of cosmetics that all players can \"buy and use to have more fun with Rust\", regardless of when they started with the game. Additionally, the devs view the store as a way to experiment with cosmetics that they reckon players might dig, and a good place to stick them. The post explains that the Rust team often has ideas for new items and skins but doesn't have an obvious outlet for them, with some not being \"big enough to justify a DLC pack\" or in-keeping with a monthly update's theme. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/permanent-store-items-skins\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/november-update-rocket-launching-system\">Rust's November update brings desert bases and new rocket launching system</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/halloween-update\">Rust will let you trick or treat for an M249</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/missions\">Rust gets NPC mission-givers</a> ",

        "contents": "Store Update - Nomad Suit Today we're excited to announce the launch of Rust's permanent in-game store. The new store will feature premium cosmetic items and skins. To kick things off we're releasing the Nomad skin. The Nomad skin is a hazmat reskin replacement that can be applied when crafting the hazmat suit or by placing the hazmat suit into a repair bench. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211118/rust_nomadsuit_02_1080p.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211118/rust_nomadsuit_01_1080p.jpg Additionally, we're also launching some new items such as new lights, underwear and even a used sofa. We received a lot of feedback and comments after the recent store announcement so we'd like to address them here: Why launch this now? We've found over the years that players really value being able to choose different skins and items to enjoy Rust, like the Spacesuit hazmat skin, or fun seasonal stuff like Christmas lights or fireworks packs. We're also very aware that Rust has grown in popularity but many new players won't be aware that they have these options. Our idea is to expand that by having a core offering of permanently available, premium, cosmetic items and skins items that all players (new and old) can buy and use to have more fun with Rust. It also gives us more scope to experiment with things we think you'll like - we often have ideas for skins and items but they haven't always found a place (e.g. not big enough to justify a DLC pack, don't fit a monthly themed update). Will you still do limited availability skins and DLC? Yes, we'll still regularly launch timed-availability skins and items, especially working with Rust community creators, as well as our DLC packs (Instruments, Sunburn and Voice Props). Will the new skins and items be tradeable? No, at present items and skins sold on the permanent store will not be able to resold on the Steam marketplace and hold no resale monetary value, nor can these items be traded on Steam. This is to help differentiate them from the other types of skins/items we've sold in the past and will still sell. We're going to keep all this under review. Will there be more items coming to the new store? Yes! We'll be releasing more over the coming months and getting feedback from you on what works and what doesn't. Other stuff worth knowing Items on the permanent store may be discounted or discontinued at a later date but we'll give you a heads up when we plan to make this happen. We look forward to reading your feedback and suggestions. Additional Store items In addition to the Nomad Hazmat skin we're releasing the following items: Sofa - Pattern A beat up, used, stained, discarded sofa with a floral pattern. https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b1711b1/sofa.pattern.deployed.icon.png Still comfortable, though. Coconut underwear Sets of island underwear made form coconuts, leaves, and grass. https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b1711b1/underwear_female_grassskirt_top.icon.png Comes in 2 variations No crafting required!

They are built from a pool of individual modules and fill 4 different templates. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211102/dmb_aerial_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211102/dmb_dressing_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211103/dmb_street_02.jpg Each has a few points of entry, regular loot with a sprinkle of oil and you will face some resistance from scientists as well. MLRS The new Desert Military Base monuments each have a parked Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). This vehicle doesn't move - you won't be driving it around the map - but it can be set up to fire rockets to any target. Except safe zones, naturally. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211103/mlrs_03.jpg These MLRS rockets can do significant damage to bases. They can be countered by SAM sites, but a full barrage of 12 rockets will only be mostly repelled by two SAM sites, and completely fought off by three. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211103/mlrs_int_01.jpg Using the MLRS 1. First you'll need to acquire an MLRS Aiming Module which can be found in locked hackable crates and one to twelve MLRS rockets that are found in elite, APC and Attack helicopter crates. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211103/mlrs_06.jpg 2. Interact with the back of the MLRS and insert your rockets. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211104/mlrs_int_02.jpg 3. Get in the MLRS and open the Aiming Module slot, and insert your aiming module, which will activate the weapon systems. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211104/mlrs_int_03.jpg 4. Interact with the targeting screen and set your desired target. https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b0211b1/aim.jpg You can click-and-drag to move the map around, and click to place the target. If you've set a marker on the main map view earlier, it'll show up here as a red marker, which should help with targeting bases. A red crosshair indicates where you want to aim. A white circle indicates where the MLRS will actually hit. These will usually match, but can differ if the MLRS is still moving its aim into position, or if there's an obstacle in the way. The MLRS shoots high in the air, so mountains and so on won't usually be a problem, but the white circle will show you if they are. The target circle shows the total area that might be damaged by an MLRS attack - not all rockets will hit the exact same spot, though there is a bias towards the centre of the circle. No damage will be done outside of the target circle area. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211104/mlrs_int_04.jpg 5. Press button to fire. The MLRS will shoot all the rockets you have loaded, and break down for 10 minutes (or whatever the brokenDownMinutes console variable is set to). https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211103/mlrs_05.jpg Improvements & Fixes Highlights Painting Undo - Added undo & redo support for painting Marketplace Search - Added search option when browsing shops at marketplace Crouching Gestures - Can now use hand gestures while crouching https://files.facepunch.com/New%20Project%20%281%29.jpg Check out the changelog for more changes. Blueprint Wipe On December 2nd, in line with Rust's next major update patch, we'll be forcing a blueprint wipe across all servers. Additionally, we'll be looking at retiring a number of lower populated Facepunch servers. Twitch Drops - Charitable Rust Nov 20 -21 A special edition of Twitch drops will be enabled on November 20-21 for charitable Rust. Charitable Rust has raised $540,786 over the past 6 years supporting various charities such as Rise Above the Disorder, Pencils of Promise and charity: water. This year the charity charitable Rust is supporting is Preemptive Love. Preemptive Love provides aid in countries of conflict with food, water, medical care relief and much more for families on the frontlines of violence. Check out the charitable Rust website (https://www.charitablerust.com/ )for more details.

There are two major additions this month, which are aimed at letting players set themselves up with military bases in the desert and then blowing enemies (\"or anyone nearby\") to smithereens. With the November update, Rust is getting \"fully procedural military bases\" which will be different on every server, every server wipe, Facepunch explains in a press release. These bases' structures and layouts draw from a pool of individual modules and will fill four different templates. In each you'll find \"a few\" places of entry and some \"regular regular loot with a sprinkle of oil\". Apparently, the <a href=\"https://rust.fandom.com/wiki/Scientist\">scientists</a> that hang about by the bases won't be thrilled to see players approach, though, so be prepared to face resistance from them. Perhaps most importantly, at each desert military base monument you'll find a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) parked up. This is a vehicle that you can use to fire off up to 12 rockets at any target - not including safe zones, of course - which can pack a serious punch against bases and \"unprotected targets of opportunity (hello, zerg hordes)\". <a href=\"https://rustlabs.com/item/sam-site\">SAM sites</a> can counter these to some extent, but you'll need multiple of them to completely fight off a full barrage of 12 rockets - two SAM sites can only partially repel this many, though three sites should do the trick if faces with the full whack. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/november-update-rocket-launching-system\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/halloween-update\">Rust will let you trick or treat for an M249</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/missions\">Rust gets NPC mission-givers</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/supply-drop-changes\">Rust is getting supply drop changes that'll make them a lot easier to spot</a> ",

That includes <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust\">Rust</a>, which is getting a special Halloween update with loads of seasonal hijinks to get up to. You'll be able to carve pumpkins and build Frankensteinian monstrosities, but maybe the most exciting bit is that you'll be able to trick or treat for guns. Once the Halloween update lands on October 28, a candy hunt event will run every two in-game days. You'll have three minutes to collect all the candy you can, and the top three players will get loot bags. You can pop open both the candy and loot bags for \"various types of loot ranging from scrap all the way up to an M249\", as the devs explain in a press release, or you can upgrade those candies for better loot as you go. You can grab a pumpkin bucket for instant candy pickup or a scarecrow wrap for candy vision, too. Speaking of pumpkins, there are also carvable pumpkins here, which look like they provide much more robust carving options than the old jack-o-lantern items. The devs will be running a pumpkin carving contest offering £75 worth of skins and two Rust DLC keys to the winner - you'll be able to get more details on that contest on the <a href=\"https://facepunch.com/\">official site</a> as of October 28. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/halloween-update\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/missions\">Rust gets NPC mission-givers</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/supply-drop-changes\">Rust is getting supply drop changes that'll make them a lot easier to spot</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/september-update-quality-of-life-changes\">Rust has a whole bunch of quality-of-life changes coming up</a> ",

        "contents": "This month's update brings the foundation of the mission system, huge amount of quality of life improvements, a camper vehicle module and much more! Missions Today we're introducing the first iteration of a mission system to Rust. You are now able to speak to various NPCs found around the world and receive a list of objectives you must complete in exchange for a reward. This first pass of missions are geared more towards players just getting started but the system is capable of much more. We will be expanding on this in the coming months to include PvP missions (capture and hold, delivery, ambush) and eventually even bounty hunting. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211008/peackeeper_idle1.jpg You can find mission providers at most safe zones and their tasks vary, from catching fish or harvesting lumber to hunting sharks and uncovering hidden treasure. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211007/lumberjack_02.jpg The mission system will be expanded upon over the coming months. We look forward to reading your feedback. Camper Module Take that long overdue vacation in the new Camper module for your modular car. It’s a two slot module that includes 4 seats that function as spawn points, overhead lockers, a bbq and a small box worth of storage. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210930/campervan_garage_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211001/campervan_int_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211001/campervan_int_02.jpg To mark a seat in the camper van as a respawn point simply sit in it, look down and use “Make Bed” to claim it. You will then be able to respawn directly into that seat regardless of its location, even while the car is moving! If another player has claimed a seat, you'll have to clear their ownership before you can claim it as your own (this will appear as an interaction option). The module requires a T2 workbench, 175 Metal Frags and 125 Wood to craft. You’ll find the locker above the seats, the barbecue to your side and the small storage box underneath the barbecue. Happy camping! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20211001/campervan_01.jpg General QOL Jarryd spent some time this month working through a backlog of quality of life improvements that we’ve assembled internally. Thankfully all of you in the community had plenty more ideas so after a month of work the QOL list is now even longer than it was at the start. Thanks to everyone across Discord, Reddit and Twitter for suggesting ideas! If your suggestion wasn’t implemented this month rest assured we’ve taken plenty of notes for future work in this area. A lot of the changes are pretty scattershot and all around the game (see the changelog for more details), but some of the notable changes are below. Sign Painting The primary improvement for sign painting this month is being able to pick up signs and redeploy them without losing the painted content. You can now pick up signs, picture frames and neon signs with the hammer, inspect the painting in your inventory, trade it to others and redeploy it at will. The sign painting interface has also had some improvements, including being able to voice chat while painting and better lighting settings for large paintable sources. Auto Turrets After many (many) requests we’re adding the ability to authorize friends to auto turrets, as well as automatically authorizing yourself when placing the auto turret. Door opening while wounded You’ll now need to hold down the interact key to open the door while wounded. Watch out for door campers! Admin UI We’ve created a simple admin UI accessible in the F1 menu for server admins to easily modify and administrate their server. This isn’t meant to be a replacement for RCON or the console, but hopefully it will act as a simpler way for new admins to manage basic elements of their server. If there are more features you’d like to see feel free to reach out, this is just the first iteration of this tool. Improvements & Fixes Highlights Vehicles On Cargo - Can now land on the cargo ship without your vehicle sliding off ADS Sensitivity - Added a separate slider to modify sensitivity while aiming Skin Search - Search for skins by name in the Repair Bench and Crafting Menu Item Counts - Show the total count of items in inventory when picking up items Large Planter snapping - Large Planters now snap to centre of foundations and floors Auto fill code lock - Added a button to auto fill the last code entered into a code lock Rowboat Flip - Boats now rightside up with one push Horse Dung - Horses now produce dung more often Binoculars Zoom - Now start at the lowest zoom setting Supply Drop Beacon - Supply drops now activate a red beacon at night Snap Disable - Holding sprint now disables snapping on planter and high external wall placement Engine Components Craft - All modular car engine components craft reduced from 30s to 10s Check out the changelog for more changes. Steam Point Store We're currently working on some Rust assets for the Steam point store which we plan to release in the coming weeks. Let us know what you think and if you have any suggestions! You can take a look at the animated avatars, profile frames and profile backgrounds over on the DEVBLOG Halloween update On October 28th at 19:00BST / 14:00 EST we'll be releasing a mandatory server and client update to enable some new spooky features! Changelog New Camper Module New F1 Admin UI Added Missions system Added a search text box to the skin picker in the Repair Panel and Crafting menu Added a button to enter the last entered code in the code lock (can also press Reload to trigger the button) Added an Aim Down Sights sensitivity multiplier (acts as a multiplier on base sensitivity eg. 0.5 mouse sensitivity x 0.5 ADS sensitivity = 0.25 sensitivity while aiming) Item descriptions now scale to fit long descriptions in the Crafting menu Binoculars now fade in/out twice as fast and start at the lowest zoom setting Can now voice chat while painting signs Sign painting will no longer use a low resolution texture on low graphics settings Show the total amount of an item in your inventory on the item pickup pop up in the bottom right of the screen The planter inventory can now only be accessed by looking at the edge of the planter Large planters now snap to the centre of foundation and floor blocks (hold Sprint to disable) Flipped boats should now reliably flip rightside up with one push Looking at vehicles that have no seats left will now show as Occupied instead of showing a Mount option that won’t work Painted signs can now be picked up (includes empty picture frames and neon signs) without losing their painted data Unpainted signs can now be stacked up to 5 Painted signs have a small icon in their inventory and clicking on them will show the painted data Increased range of light source in painting UI so large signs aren’t partially illuminated The sign painting UI will now remember the rotation of the last sign that was painted (per session) Open/closing doors while crawling now takes three seconds When attempting to build too close to a monument the error message will now display the translated name of the monument (instead of “Can’t build here”) Improved several placement error messages F4 and F9 keys are no longer hardcoded to screenshots, added screenshot.takescreenshot and screenshot.takehiresscreenshot that can be bound as needed Right clicking scrap while a research panel is open will put the scrap in the bottom slot Lowered volume of audio static in the background of boom boxes, speakers, etc Right clicking a pumpkin in the inventory will now move the pumpkin to the belt instead of clothing Ceiling light can now be repaired more reliably from below Worms and grubs will go the inventory by default instead of the belt Auto Turrets now automatically self-auth when placed (like TC’s) Added an Assign to Friend option to Auto Turrets Any team members in the Assign to a friend Sleeping Bag/Auto Turret UI will now appear first in the list Don’t show steam ID’s on Sleeping Bag/Auto Turret friend UI while streamer mode is active Human skulls being sold in vending machines will now display their name in the tooltip Item search in crafting menu should now disregard accented characters when filtering (eg. Pólvora and Polvora will now both return gunpowder when playing in Portugese) Supply Drops now have small lights that activate at night entity.deleteby now accepts multiple steam ids Added entity.deletebytextblock that parses a text block for steam ids (eg. can use the results of “ent auth”) Added \"cargoshipevent\" command for server owners to start the cargo ship event Horses now produce dung more often Dung yeilds more Fertilizer Added custom junkyard prefabs for map makers Military tunnels NPCs no longer respawn while players are inside tunnelsMilitary tunnels elite crates respawn inline with AI (no more looting elite crates with no AI spawned) Added small (50) MinDistanceDifferentType to roadside monuments Less strict locker placement Added \"Copy\" and \"Clear\" to the console UI Reduced crafting time of all modular car engine components from 30s to 10s Fixed garage doors blocking placement on the floor above them while open Running a dedicated server will no longer set graphics quality to 0 on clients on the same machine Fixed issue where binding a key to nothing that was also a default key wouldn’t save correctly and the binding would be lost on next boot (can now unbind mouse wheel) Fixed glowing hair in player inventory preview Fixed issue where players would get stuck in a placeholder dance when respawning if they were dancing when killed Fixed Boom Box loading incorrect URL after a player leaves and enters network range or after a respawn Fixed tanker car module not getting properly disconnected from water sources when moving Fixed Small sign stacking Fixed elevator exploits Fixed excessive explosion force on the chinook Fixed cargo ship layouts breaking during server restart Fixed paddle glow outline being flipped Removed Gravis Island from Facepunch servers ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust\">Rust</a>'s October update is nearly upon us, and it's a big one, finally introducing the game's long-awaited mission system. As of October 7, you'll be getting a host of more directed objectives from NPCs, and there are plenty of other additions to look forward to in the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival game</a>. The big addition this time around is the mission system. You'll now be able to speak to NPCs and pick up quests that'll direct you to complete objectives in exchange for rewards like scrap or treasure boxes. The devs emphasize in a press release that this is just the \"first iteration\" of the mission system, and is currently focused on newer players. Mission-givers will be available at most safe zones, and initial tasks will include things like catching fish, harvesting lumber, hunting sharks, or looking for treasure. It's all solo for now, but co-op options are coming, as are PvP-focused objectives and bounty hunting. The mission system was initially supposed to launch in the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/september-update-quality-of-life-changes\">September update</a>, but was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alistair_McF/status/1432836941955969024\">pushed back</a> here \"due to quality and content concerns\". <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/missions\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/supply-drop-changes\">Rust is getting supply drop changes that'll make them a lot easier to spot</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/september-update-quality-of-life-changes\">Rust has a whole bunch of quality-of-life changes coming up</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/underwater-labs-september-update\">The Rust devs are making underwater labs more worthwhile</a> ",

Rust YouTuber Shadowfrax has just shared the latest details on what the devs have been cooking up, and it includes a key change for supply drops. In the game's staging - that is, live testing - branch, there are some updates to how visible supply drops are, as Shadowfrax explains in the clip below. \"Many supply drops delivered between the in-game hours of 8pm and 7am will now have a big, rotating light on top and white lights on the bottom,\" he notes - and there's some footage giving you a good idea of what this'll look like in practice to see. These lights will stay switched on for \"a while\" after a supply drop hits the ground to help players locate it in areas with dense foliage - though it's worth noting the siren light will only be visible once you're within a certain distance of the box o' goodies. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/supply-drop-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/september-update-quality-of-life-changes\">Rust has a whole bunch of quality-of-life changes coming up</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/underwater-labs-september-update\">The Rust devs are making underwater labs more worthwhile</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/submarine-changes-missions\">Rust's submarines are getting nerfed and missions are in the works again</a> ",

Rust YouTuber Shadowfrax has just shared the latest clip in his series of developer updates giving us an idea of the changes and additions heading the game's way, and it looks like we've got a bunch of quality-of-life changes in store. While a bunch of new content, like the new desert monument and other bits, is still in the works, \"this month in general has been focussed on quality of life\", the 'Tuber explains in the September 17 clip (below). There's a pretty hefty list of changes coming, with a spread of different tweaks and tinkerings across gameplay. You'll now be able to pick up painted signs and get them to retain their image, ShadowFrax explains, and viewed - delightful daubings included - in your inventory. Non-painted signs, though, will now stack up to five in their slots. In the same vein, the changes also mean you'll be able to use voice chat while painting your next masterpiece on a sign. \"Bob Ross would be proud,\" ShadowFrax muses. I'm sure he would. Signs - and also the game's map - will also now display at full quality irrespective of your graphics settings, too.

Underwater labs are getting a major revamp to make them more worth visiting, submarines are getting nerfed, and we're getting fishing shops. Here's what you can expect. The map labs count has been cut in half to three, but each lab you find will be larger. As the devs say in the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252490/view/2978556685267344364\">announcement</a>, \"you will no longer find underwater labs that are only a couple of rooms in size, so they should all be worth a visit\".

We've talked about the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/submarine-changes-missions\">submarine nerfs before</a>, but surface torpedoes have been removed, and submarines are now forced to surface for air every ten minutes.

        "contents": "Underwater Labs Improvements Since the Underwater Labs release, we've been following your feedback closely. The majority of feedback was surrounding high loot density and lack of player interaction. We've now reduced the map Labs count from 6 to 3, removed red and blue keycard spawns, additionally loot crates will no longer spawn while players are nearby. To suit the reduced total number of underwater labs per map, we increased the smallest allowed size per underwater lab. You will no longer find underwater labs that are only a couple of rooms in size, so they should all be worth a visit. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/moonpool_small_exterior.jpg Many of you have certainly noticed that the moonpool water was bullet proof. This was an unintended effect from the complexities of dealing with the water carving volumes and has now been fixed. Speaking of moonpools, a human sized version has been added in the mix to allow for more points of entry in the labs. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210827/moonpool_small_interior.jpg Finally, we addressed a number of small glitches in the procedural generation that could cause corridor, iceberg and vegetation overlaps. SUBMARINES Storage Both types of submarine now have storage with 12 slots. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/substorage_solo1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/substorage_duo1.jpg Torpedoes The Surface torpedo has been removed due to players camping underwater with little to no risk. Torpedoes can still be fired at surface targets by surfacing the submarine and firing a standard torpedo. Oxygen Submarines also now need to surface for air every ten minutes, either on the ocean's surface or in a moon pool. Otherwise, after ten minutes you'll start taking slow damage. As part of implementing this change, I've revamped the oxygen UI a bit, and you can now see how much time you have left from a diving tank as well. https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b3011b1/oxygen_sub.gif https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b3011b1/oxygen_diving.gif https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b3011b1/oxygen.gif Other The rear passenger in a duo sub can now turn all the way around. Sonar blips only show up for other running subs, not every sub that's parked in someone's base. And subs stop moving a lot more quickly when someone dismounts, meaning they won't run away on you if you accidentally dismount underwater. Submarines now take additional damage from bullets. Fishing Village Shop A custom shop has been added inside the fishing villages to accommodate all your fishing gear needs. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/fishingvillage_store1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/fishingvillage_store2.jpg Improvements & Fixes Highlights Crawling Health - Crawling health is reduced by 75% Swimming Gestures - Can now use non dance gestures while swimming Shooting Players Underwater - Fixed projectiles dealing no damage to players underwater Gravis Island Gravis Island is running for the final month across Facepunch official servers, here is the map change lists: Fixed Floating rocks Removed offshore topology from ocean villages Roughed up the edge of the offshore topology to remove the straight line of ocean plants Smoothed out some spiky ocean terrain Tidied up mainland topo + removed it from very small landmasses in ocean Tidied up underwater splat Edited terrain around harbour slightly, some areas were floating Added more ladder triggers to harbour Fixed some areas of alpha Patched some more Floating rocks with gaps allowing for sneaky sneaky. Adjusted some Splat in a few areas were the texture effects in game were rough. Fixed the terrain difference at Power plant with a few floating objects. Reduced the beach topology on the sand peninsulas so spawn points aren't as focal to one area Applied river topology to the two northern ponds/lakes for fresh water Removed the blue metal crate from fishing village since it's nearly impossible to get out if you jump in. Added large rock formation to the middle of the larger secluded island for more natural cover since it was quite bare with just trees/bushes Made several small pathways up the rock faces on the beaches where players spawn so they won't have to travel as far to go inland from the cliff face Added prevent build volumes to the tunnel near mil tuns since somehow i missed that previously Replaced all crates with the new native spawners Added splat on a couple rocks Reduced Labs to 3 If you're a server owner and wish to host your own Gravis Island map then check out the official site. RGB Integration For people with Razer and/or SteelSeries hardware, we have added some RGB keyboard effects for different states in the game. Blue breathing effect when too cold Red breathing effect when too hot Flash red when hurt / damage taken Flash red continuously when below 25% HP Flash red rapid continues when downed / crawling Flashing green when radiated Solid white when in building privilege area Green breathing when 25%+ comfort If you'd rather keep your custom rainbow effects enabled while playing Rust then this integration can be turned off at any time in the Rust options menu, in the general Options tab (scroll down - it's below Physics). You'll also find an option for brightness there. Also, for anyone who loves RGB and custom binds, there is a console command which will make your RGBs flash a custom color for however long you wish. The following will flash it purple for 0.2 seconds: rgbeffects.pulse 255,0,255 0.2 NVIDIA Reflex Update In May we added support for Nvidia Reflex which reduced system latency by up to 38%, but now that number is even higher with the release of the Reflex SDK 1.5 update. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/02/0P47B1/rust-nvidia-reflex-geforce-system-latency-optimizations.png Read more here.

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/going-deep-update\">Rust's August update</a> was one hefty content drop, adding an underwater biome, submarines, torpedoes, sharks, and, well, just a whole lot of subaquatic <em>stuff</em>. Now, it's time to look ahead and see what else is on the horizon. Rust YouTuber Shadowfrax has posted a clip offering us the rundown of what's in the pipeline right now, and it includes some nerfs for the newly added submarines, \"some kind of military camp\", and those missions that have been mentioned in the past. In Shadowfrax's latest Rust update (below) the YouTuber notes that after the next patch you should see torpedoes get slapped with a bit of a nerf. Torpedoes will get a larger 'aimcone' with less accuracy over distance. Plus, a change is coming that'll add a small puff of smoke to the submarine when it fires a shot to signal where it came from - so, it sounds like they'll be a tad less sneaky once that's be rolled out. Additionally, the 'Tuber notes that in Rust's game commits, there's a new branch tied to 'submarine oxygen' which indicates some changes aimed at changing how long you can stay holed away in your sub. It seems that, going by these, you'll need to make sure you surface and get some air every so often, or keep a diving tank on you. Rust's drowning status is getting a rename to 'low oxygen' to reflect this adjustment. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/submarine-changes-missions\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/going-deep-update\">Rust is getting an underwater biome, underwater dungeons, and fishing</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sharks-submarines-spearguns\">Shark Week is coming to Rust, permanently</a> ",

        "contents": "You can expect there to be a bit of a watery theme to <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rust</a> this month. Developer Facepunch Studios has revealed that this month's Going Deep update introduces an underwater biome with procedural underwater lab dungeons, submarines, torpedoes, sharks, spear guns, fishing, and underwater ambience effects. You'll find the new underwater labs on the ocean floor in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can access two entry points with a submarine to find various puzzles, enemies, and loot. If you fancy doing some prep ahead of time, you can connect to a vast network of CCTV cameras. Want some downtime? The mess hall room might have a selection of high stakes poker, music, and cooking for you to engage with with your group. Speaking of submarines, you'll be able to buy those from the boat shops at fishing villages. A two-person sub has internal fuel access and an instrument cluster, including rudimentary sonar, whereas the single-person sub doesn't have any instruments. Both subs do, though, have torpedoes, so have fun with that. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/going-deep-update\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sharks-submarines-spearguns\">Shark Week is coming to Rust, permanently</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/crawling-wounded\">Rust due to get new wounded and recovery mechanics next update</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a> ",

They will come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and for now, with two entry points. You enter them from a ‘moonpool’ in which you re-surface with your submarine. From there, make sure you have come prepared to face the various puzzles on offer. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210802/moonpool1.jpg The bases have a wide network of CCTV cameras you can connect to to plan your exploration ahead of time. The new and improved player map will also let you see the layout of the base for each floor. You will also find microphones in some rooms that let you broadcast your commands into the entire base’s network. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/labs_int1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/labs_int2.jpg If you like to take risks, the occasional mess hall room will allow you to play some high stakes poker, listen to music with your group and cook some meats before heading back to pick a fight with the NPCs that are dwelling in the corridors. Submarines This update introduces submarines to Rust. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210804/subs2.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/duosub_int1.jpg You can now buy a submarine from the boat shops at fishing villages. The two-person submarine seats up to two, with internal fuel access and an instrument cluster including rudimentary sonar. Look around behind you and you'll see interaction UI to swap seats. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/duosub_ext1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/duosub_int2.jpg The one-person submarine seats one, with external fuel access and no instruments. Torpedoes https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210804/torpedo_direct.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210804/torpedo_surface.jpg Both submarines have torpedo tubes which can fire two torpedo types: - Direct torpedoes fire straight ahead. - Surface torpedoes rise to the surface and then speed along the top of the water. You can buy torpedoes from a fishing village vending machine, or craft them yourself. Controls Use movement keys for forward/back/left/right. Sprint button to rise towards the surface. Crouch button to dive deeper. Look down when in the cockpit to load torpedoes. Fire when in water with the usual shoot button (left mouse button by default). Enter underwater bases at moon pool locations, which show up on sonar in the duo sub as red dots. If you're in the solo sub, look for the lights being cast down below moon pool modules. Decay Submarines have the same decay style as rowboats and the RHIB. For the first 45 minutes of being unused, they won't decay. Then they'll start to lose health: They'll last another 240 minutes if left unused outside, or 180 minutes if in deep water. If they're indoors and NOT in deep water, they won't ever decay at all. Fishing The Handmade Fishing Rod is now fully functional and ready for use! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/fishing1.jpg To get started, you'll need to equip a bait in the lure slot of the rod. Various foods can be used as bait and their value as a bait is displayed in the item information. As well as food you can now randomly find worms and grubs when collecting resources in the world (berries, hemp, potatoes, etc). You have double chance of finding these when harvesting plants planted by a player. Once you've got a bait ready to go simply aim at the water while holding RMB and cast out with LMB. Once you've got a bite, you'll need to reel in the fish. You can use A/D to pull left and right and S to reel the fish in. Fighting the movement of the fish left and right will tire it out and make it move less over time. However reeling in the fish and pulling left and right will put strain on the line, if you strain it too much the line will snap and the fish will get away. The rod will start shaking and you'll start hearing audio cues when the line is strained, so be sure to stop if your line is about to snap. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/fish1.jpg We've added 8 new types of fish to catch, from Herring, Anchovy and Sardines to Yellow Perch, Catfish, Small Sharks, Salmon and Orange Roughy. Different fish have different conditions for catching, including bait value, water type, water depth and location. As well as gutting the fish for resources, you can also take your catches to any fishing village to exchange for scrap. Underwater Ambience & Effects We've made some changes to the general underwater look and feel. Visibility has gone up across the board, lighting will get darker the deeper you go, and all-in-all it should just be a bit more engaging than the 'ol dive into water and become blind unless you got the magic goggles equipped. Speaking of goggles, the diving goggle screen overlay also doesn't self illuminate anymore in darkness, which should make them less distracting to use in low-light. And finally the wet shore look no longer extends deep down into the ocean, which never made any sense in the first place. These changes are all fairly technical, so expect to see more improvements underwater as we iterate on them in the future. Sharks https://files.facepunch.com/Taylor/1b0211b1/shark03.jpg Exploring the deep may yield great rewards, but with those rewards comes great risks. Each dive site has a chance to spawn a shark which will patrol the area and must be defeated before you are able to claim whatever treasures found at the dive site. You can use a melee weapon in an attempt to defend yourself but your chances of survival are very slim without some kind of underwater ranged weapon... Speargun To be able to defend yourself at a distance underwater is of paramount importance given the introduction of hostile marine life. You can now learn how to craft a spear gun + ammo from a Level 1 Workbench. This weapon can only be fired while underwater and packs a punch similar to a crossbow, albeit with a slower moving projectile. It is also very effective at dispatching hostile human beings. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210804/speargun_diver1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/speargun_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/speargun_vm_01.jpg Improvements & Fixes Highlights Electrical Panel UI The electrical panel now displays in the crafting menu Highlight IO LMB while hovering over IO socket to highlight just that connection Undo Last IO Press RMB to cancel the last point of an electrical/water line Ice Lakes Fixed Ice lakes never spawning Mountains Fixed prefab mountains not spawning on large maps Small Sign Placement Small sign placement on deployables Boom Box Decay Boom box no longer decays Underground Rail Network Side tunnels In this update we have added some further improvements to the underground rail network. Until now, we have been spawning the workcarts right in front of the rail platforms. However, this has always been a temporary solution and in this update we have added dedicated side tunnels and maintenance rooms where the workcarts will spawn from now on. Each station will contain two of these side tunnels. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/sidetunnels_04.jpg In order to access these new spawn points you will need to reach the platform and find one of the door marked with a green Maintenance Room sign. Then simply follow the corridor and it will lead you to a brand-new room where the workcart will be waiting for you. The train tunnel in front of you will then lead you back to the rail network. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/sidetunnels_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/sidetunnels_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/sidetunnels_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210803/sidetunnels_05.jpg In addition, while I was working on these side rooms I have also fixed a long standing issue where jumping onto the rail platforms from the tracks below was too difficult. Now if you happen to fall off the platform you can jump right back. Check out the changelog for more changes.",

The <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survival game</a> has a slew of new features on the horizon, and among them are a major underwater overhaul that adds sharks, as well as a couple tools for dealing with them. As yet, there are no images to share of Rust's sharks, but the intrepid Rust <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shadow_frax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTuber Shadowfrax</a> has a video that goes into a bit of detail about what's on the horizon in the next updates. He speculates that sharks will likely be restricted to specific areas in the ocean, and in any case, a great way to avoid sharks both in Rust and in real life is to simply stay on dry land. However, if you do find yourself face to snout with a shark, you'll want to have a nice speargun at your side. These are coming to Rust as well, and as Shadowfrax notes, they fill an important gap in Rust's arsenal by being fireable underwater. As you'll recall, this is where the sharks tend to be. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sharks-submarines-spearguns\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/crawling-wounded\">Rust due to get new wounded and recovery mechanics next update</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-june-2021\">Rust's June update brings a new contact system, AI, improved animals, and more</a> ",

Blast out some music with the Boom Box, intimidate your neighbours with the Megaphone and Microphone Stand, phone a friend (or enemy, or stranger) with the Mobile Phone, and more. But because Rust is a hardcore PvP survival shooter, we also knew we needed to finally remedy its most obvious omission - a disco. This DLC pack includes a range of new items that allow you to record, stream, project and playback audio, as well as accessorize your base with some disco themed props. It also includes three new dance gestures and 7 achievements to unlock. Cassettes and Recordings Cassettes can store snippets of audio and can be used in a variety of ways. To record audio onto a Cassette, simply insert it into a Cassette Recorder and hit RMB to record. Cassettes come in 10, 20 and 30 second varieties. Once audio is recorded onto a Cassette you can press LMB to play it. You can also throw the Recorder with the Reload key, handy for sticking it on to vehicles or structures. If you'd like to not hear recorded audio (for streaming purposes) you can disable it in the Options menu. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/cassettes1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/cassette_recorder1.jpg Boom Boxes If you want to play your audio on something with a bit more oomph you can use a Boom Box. Coming in both static and deployed versions, you can use a Boom Box to play both recorded audio on Cassettes and stream internet radio. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/boombox1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/boombox2.jpg To stream audio from the internet you’ll need to open the settings and select a channel. A few notes on this system: We recommend content creators turn off this feature (set Internet Audio Streams to Off in the Options menu) in order to not trigger any copyright/DCMA strikes Server Admins can add additional stations that might interest their players. Use the BoomBox.ServerValidStations convar to add stations (eg. BoomBox.ServerValidStations “Test Station,www.teststation.com”) Deployed Boom Boxes can also be connected to other audio entities via the Audio Out IO port. Megaphone and Microphone Stand You can project your voice to friends and foes with the Megaphone and Microphone Stand. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/megaphone1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/micstand1.jpg The Megaphone is a held entity that you can use while out and about. Hold LMB to activate it and broadcast your voice. While holding LMB you won’t need to press your push to talk key if push to talk is enabled. The Microphone Stand is a deployable version of the Megaphone that requires power. It has two different voice modes to modify your voice (squeaky and deep) and has an Audio Out IO port like the Boom Box to connect to other props in the DLC pack. Disco Props Give your base some late night disco vibes! Use the Disco Floor, Laser Light, Connected Speaker and Sound Light to set up a dancefloor that will make your neighbours jealous. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/discodance1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/discoball1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/laserlights1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/soundlights1.jpg All of these props have an Audio In IO port so you can connect them to an audio source (like a Boom Box or Microphone Stand) to make them react to any playing audio. The Connected Speaker will rebroadcast any audio from an audio source that it’s connected to, so you can play music throughout your entire base or hook them up to a Microphone Stand to make a base wide PA system. New Dances A dancefloor is pointless without dancing, so this DLC pack includes three new dance gestures. Unlike the existing gestures these dances will loop endlessly and you won’t be able to move while dancing. To cancel a dance you can just press a move input, jump, crouch or hit LMB. https://files.facepunch.com/discodance2.jpg Mobile Phone Take calls on the go - and stylishly - with the latest in telecommunications technology on the island: the Mobile Phone! Giving you access to the telephone system from anywhere on the island. You can open the dialler with LMB and still move around while chatting. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210628/mobilephone1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210628/mobilephone2.jpg We’ve also added the voicemail functionality to legacy deployed Telephones, simply insert a cassette with your voicemail message into the phone and anyone who calls in while you’re away will be able to leave a message for you. You can access any voicemail messages from the dialling screen. The number of voicemail messages that can be recorded depends on the length of the cassette, so a 10/20/30 second cassette can store 1/2/3 messages. If a new message is left when your voicemail is full the oldest voicemail will be deleted.",

        "contents": "Updated Wounding System Players now go to a crawling state when wounded in most cases, instead of being fully incapacitated. They can move around slowly and use doors. They also get a bit more health than they used to in the old incapacitated state. This might allow you to move to relative safety. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/crawling1.jpg The older incapacitated wounded state still occurs in the following situations: If you get looted while in crawling wounded state. If you die from fall damage. If you crawl too deep into water. In both states you still have some chance to recover after the wounded timer runs out. By default right now the base value is a 20% chance while crawling and a 10% chance while incapacitated. But you now get up to a 25% bonus on top of that (so max 20 + 25 = 45% total) based on your food and water levels. Maximum food and water = full bonus. If the above check fails, but you have a large medkit in your belt (not just your inventory), the medkit will be used up and you won't get any health from it, but you will recover from being wounded. i.e. A medkit in a belt slot gives a 100% chance at recovery when the recovery timer runs out (you can still get killed while wounded by taking damage though). And if you're lucky enough that you pass the recovey check anyway, the medkit isn't used. There is one exception where the medkit revive doesn't happen: Fall damage. So you can't dive out of a helicopter with your trusty medkit for guaranteed survival. New console variables woundedrecoverchance (default 0.2): Base chance of recovery after crawling wounded state. incapacitatedrecoverchance (default 0.1): Base chance of recovery after incapacitated wounded state. woundedmaxfoodandwaterbonus (default 0.25): Maximum percent chance added to base .wounded/incapacitated recovery chance, based on the player's food and water level. crawlingminhealth (default 30): Minimum initial health given when a player dies and moves to crawling wounded state. crawlingmaxhealth (default 50): Maximum initial health given when a player dies and moves to crawling wounded state. Train Tunnel Entrance Improvements We've added a number of improvements to the train tunnel entrances. The bottom of the stairwells now have a circular stairwell piece that is used to align the stairwell to the train tunnel grid. This has the advantage that we no longer have to snap the entrance building to a specific rotation and position, which allows us to integrate them a lot nicer inside monuments. We're planning to move more tunnel entrances to building basements or inside static monument tunnels or sewers in the near future. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210628/stairwell1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210628/stairwell2.jpg While we implemented these circular stairwells we also addressed an issue that was forcing the stairwells and elevator shafts to be extremely long, which led to boring elevator rides down to the train tunnels. This is now addressed, and the stairwells and elevator shafts that go down to the train tunnels are significantly shorter. Countryside Tunnel Entrances Also added this month is a refresh of the train tunnel entrances spawning in the countryside, as in any entrance that lives outside of monuments. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/06/28/4L99M1/RustClient_rIFuYoaEFd.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/06/28/6c93k1/RustClient_ld4JOD2OVT.jpg We have redone the visuals to look like bunkers on the surface and improved the interior layout to offer more tactical options. You will also find a computer station in these countryside entrances that will allow you to connect to a CCTV camera outdoor and ensure all is clear outside before leaving. Monument AI This month we've added the first pass of AI scientists to the Trainyard and Airfield monuments, initially around the puzzle areas. This will be expanded to all major monuments in the near future. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/07/01/1h31b1/RustClient_Rv8vpyR013.jpg There's also a bunch of general bug fixes, improvements, balance and tweaks to both the animal and human AI - including a fix for unresponsive AI at low server FPS. Nvidia DLSS Nvidia DLSS is now available, DLSS can be enabled via the options menu by navigating to Options > Graphics. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/06/29/3F32c1/-article-thumb-1200x630-copy%402x.jpg Today, Rust receives its latest round of content and feature enhancements, which continue to make the game better and better. And included with the update is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS, which’ll boost your performance by up to 50%, while maintaining comparable image quality to native resolution rendering. In fact, in many instances, DLSS improves upon Rust’s previous anti-aliasing options, with reduced temporal anti-aliasing, superior detail in the distance, and improved anti-aliasing on the game’s massive amount of foliage. -Nvidia Take a look NVIDIA Rust comparision DLSS video: If you’re unfamiliar with NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) then here is a quote from the Nvidia DLSS Rust article: NVIDIA DLSS it’s a groundbreaking AI rendering technology that increases graphics performance using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs. To enable DLSS in Rust, download and install our latest Game Ready Driver, download the Rust update when released, then adjust settings in the Options > Graphics menu. Instantly, your performance will be accelerated, for a superior experience. In our testing, frame rates increased by up to 50% at 4K. Faster performance gives you smoother, more fluid gameplay, or if you love eye candy, the headroom to crank up detail levels and rendering resolutions.

Improvements & Fixes Highlights Fixed Player Name Plate Delay - Fixed invisible and delayed nametags AI Responsiveness - AI will now be more responsive when servers are under heavy load Easier Rowboat Flip - Flipping over a capsized rowboat is now eaiser Tree Birds - Birds now have a chance to fly out of trees when hit Primitive Lootbox Sound - Updated lootbox destroy sound, no longer louder than gunshots Check out the changelog for more changes. Voice Props DLC Pack The Voice Props DLC pack is available today for $12.99! Blast out some music with the Boom Box, intimidate your neighbours with the Megaphone and Microphone Stand, phone a friend (or enemy, or stranger) with the Mobile Phone, and more. But because Rust is a hardcore PvP survival shooter, we also knew we needed to finally remedy its most obvious omission - a disco. The Voice Props DLC pack is available for purchase on Steam with a 10% launch discount! This DLC pack includes a range of new items that allow you to record, stream, project and playback audio, as well as accessorize your base with some disco themed props. It also includes three new dance gestures and 7 achievements to unlock. Cassettes and Recordings Cassettes can store snippets of audio and can be used in a variety of ways. To record audio onto a Cassette, simply insert it into a Cassette Recorder and hit RMB to record. Cassettes come in 10, 20 and 30 second varieties. Once audio is recorded onto a Cassette you can press LMB to play it. You can also throw the Recorder with the Reload key, handy for sticking it on to vehicles or structures. If you'd like to not hear recorded audio (for streaming purposes) you can disable it in the Options menu. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/cassettes1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/cassette_recorder1.jpg Boom Boxes If you want to play your audio on something with a bit more oomph you can use a Boom Box. Coming in both static and deployed versions, you can use a Boom Box to play both recorded audio on Cassettes and stream internet radio. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/boombox1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/boombox2.jpg To stream audio from the internet you’ll need to open the settings and select a channel. A few notes on this system: We recommend content creators turn off this feature (set Internet Audio Streams to Off in the Options menu) in order to not trigger any copyright/DCMA strikes Server Admins can add additional stations that might interest their players. Use the BoomBox.ServerValidStations convar to add stations (eg. BoomBox.ServerValidStations “Test Station,www.teststation.com”) Deployed Boom Boxes can also be connected to other audio entities via the Audio Out IO port. Megaphone and Microphone Stand You can project your voice to friends and foes with the Megaphone and Microphone Stand. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/megaphone1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/micstand1.jpg The Megaphone is a held entity that you can use while out and about. Hold LMB to activate it and broadcast your voice. While holding LMB you won’t need to press your push to talk key if push to talk is enabled. The Microphone Stand is a deployable version of the Megaphone that requires power. It has two different voice modes to modify your voice (squeaky and deep) and has an Audio Out IO port like the Boom Box to connect to other props in the DLC pack. Disco Props Give your base some late night disco vibes! Use the Disco Floor, Laser Light, Connected Speaker and Sound Light to set up a dancefloor that will make your neighbours jealous. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/discodance1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/discoball1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/laserlights1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210629/soundlights1.jpg All of these props have an Audio In IO port so you can connect them to an audio source (like a Boom Box or Microphone Stand) to make them react to any playing audio. The Connected Speaker will rebroadcast any audio from an audio source that it’s connected to, so you can play music throughout your entire base or hook them up to a Microphone Stand to make a base wide PA system. New Dances A dancefloor is pointless without dancing, so this DLC pack includes three new dance gestures. Unlike the existing gestures these dances will loop endlessly and you won’t be able to move while dancing. To cancel a dance you can just press a move input, jump, crouch or hit LMB. https://files.facepunch.com/discodance2.jpg Mobile Phone Take calls on the go - and stylishly - with the latest in telecommunications technology on the island: the Mobile Phone! Giving you access to the telephone system from anywhere on the island. You can open the dialler with LMB and still move around while chatting. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210628/mobilephone1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210628/mobilephone2.jpg We’ve also added the voicemail functionality to legacy deployed Telephones, simply insert a cassette with your voicemail message into the phone and anyone who calls in while you’re away will be able to leave a message for you. You can access any voicemail messages from the dialling screen. The number of voicemail messages that can be recorded depends on the length of the cassette, so a 10/20/30 second cassette can store 1/2/3 messages. If a new message is left when your voicemail is full the oldest voicemail will be deleted.

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust\">Rust</a> is getting some big shake-ups to how wounding and recovery work in its next big patch. Rust YouTuber Shadowfrax has been digging into the multiplayer <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival game's</a> development and revealed that a new crawling mechanic should be on its way in the coming update, which will add a whole new element of gameplay - and chance - to getting downed. As Rust's next forced wipe is coming July 1, we should be getting a new batch of gameplay updates soon, and - while things are subject to change - crawling should be bundle in with them.. As Shadowfrax highlights, these changes are pretty significant and complex in some ways, but essentially Rust will now have two wounded states: the existing incapacitated one - in which you're stuck lying on the ground unable to, well, do anything, really - and a new, crawling state that'll give you a bit of a better chance of surviving post-wounding. You'll be reduced to crawling if your health drops to zero by most means following the changes (falling from a massive height not included). Unlike incapacitation, this version of being wounded lets you move about and open doors - though slowly, of course - and tops up your health a little more. It also offers a higher chance of recovery than the alternative, though it's naturally not guaranteed - and if someone decides to start picking your pockets while you're on all fours, you'll get incapacitated anyway. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/crawling-wounded\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-june-2021\">Rust's June update brings a new contact system, AI, improved animals, and more</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/dlc-underwater\">Rust may be getting more underwater environments, voice DLC</a> ",

These skins let you customise the look of a wide range of in-game items, which can be clothing, decorations, and other things. Each week, Facepunch announces the latest selection of Rust skins chosen on its Twitter channel, and there's usually somewhere around eight new cosmetics to browse (though it can be more). But, as the whole 'weekly skins' thing implies, each selection is only available for a short period - the remainder of that week, before a new batch o' skins gets picked to replace it. After that time, those skins will only be purchasable via the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> community market. To help you keep track of each week's new set of Rust skins, we've included a list of them below, which we'll update when the reset happens, usually towards the end of every week (because we're super nice and helpful like that). <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/server-transitions\">Here's our first peek at how Rust's server transitions could work</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/permanent-store-items-skins\">Rust gets a permanent in-game store with \"premium\" cosmetics</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/november-update-rocket-launching-system\">Rust's November update brings desert bases and new rocket launching system</a> ",

Among the stuff coming with the patch, there's a new contact system that'll help you work out friend from foe, the first phase of the Rust's AI rework, update critters, and various other bits and pieces. First up, that new contact system. Essentially, this mechanic will make a record of any new player you meet in your contacts, and any interactions you have with them - whether that be positive, not so positive, indifferent, or downright \"rage-inducing\", as Facepunch says in a press release. To help you work out who might be a pal or an enemy quickly, players' nameplates will now show up in colours to help denote their status in relation to you: blue for friendly, and red for hostile. You can use the binoculars to ascertain this from a longer distance, too. Plus, following the update, your name will get revealed if you wave at another player. On the new-and-improved AI, Facepunch says the first phase replaces a bunch of different systems with a single new one, whose main advantages are that \"it should keep the AI updated going forward\", plus it'll be easier to add new features to in the future. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-june-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/dlc-underwater\">Rust may be getting more underwater environments, voice DLC</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/may-update\">Rust's May update features its biggest visual upgrade ever</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/dying-light-crossover\">Dying Light gets a crossover with survival game Rust</a> ",

A new \"contact system\" is being rolled out as part of Rust's June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. \"Upon meeting a new player they'll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc),\" Facepunch explained in a press release. \"To help quickly identify friend from foe, players' nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn't always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances.\" On the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet. Seems like a handy way to keep track of all those nakeds. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-03-rusts-new-contact-system-will-help-you-tell-friend-from-foe\">Read more</a> ",

        "contents": "Contact System We've added a new system for keeping track of the players you interact with. You'll find a new tab on your inventory screen which will open the contacts panel. From there you'll be able to use the various controls to flag a player as either friendly or enemy. This will change how their name tag shows up when you encounter them in the world. Players are automatically added to the 'seen' category if you've been in close proximity for several seconds. Any player who kills you will be added to your Enemy list. https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0211b1/Unity_hCyjlnj9aT.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0211b1/Unity_7swA9wgZKu.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0211b1/Unity_Nw6k0AIGnk.png You can select any contact from the list and filter by category (friendly/seen/enemy) as well as assign a contact to a category. Binoculars have also received a buff, and will allow you to see a colored pip above players indicating if they are an enemy or a friend. https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0211b1/Unity_FB6MQojMTv.png There is a rudimentary reputation system in the works which will very slightly shade your nametag either blue or red based on how likely you are to kill on sight. This system is a work in progress and will be expanded upon in the future. Any server can disable the contacts system with the convar relationshipmanage.contacts false The nametag system has also changed and you can now display your name plate at long distances to anyone you are looking at by using the 'wave' gesture. We hope this will allow players to avoid killing other 'friendly' players and grant the ability to signal your intentions. https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0211b1/Unity_yS5BhAXzGj.jpg As for the majority of hardcore rust players who kill everyone on sight anyway, you may as well pretend this system does not exist as it will not affect you. However for those less inclined to destroy and kill every living thing that passes infront of them. This system might help you find some like-minded players to team up with. Wire Colour Coding This was suggested on Reddit and we all felt like it was a good idea so I added the ability to colour code your electrical wires and hoses this month. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210601/wires.jpg Simply hold Reload while holding the Wire Tool/Hose Tool to select which colour you’d like to use. Demo Shot System This month we’re adding the first iteration of a more advanced feature set for viewing and manipulating demos. This has primarily been built to improve our internal production tools, but considering the rich and diverse community of Rust content creators out there we’d love for this to be a tool that all of you can use. Once you load a demo with “demo.hud” turned on, you’ll see a variety of new options including a shot manager and scrubbable timeline. Pressing the ALT key at any time will switch control between the demo UI and debug camera. You can now create and manage 'shots' within demos, which are individual recordings of camera motion as well as properties such as FOV and DOF. These shots can then be played back in-sync with the demo scene. To create a shot, simply press the “New Shot” button, give it a name and then hit record - your live camera movement will now be recorded. To end a shot recording, press the Escape key. For added management, shots can be sorted into folders, moved between folders, renamed and deleted all from the in-game interface. Folders can also be renamed/deleted by right clicking on them in the shot list. This current shot system is the first stage of a comprehensive cinematic toolset we’ve planned out. Our goal for the future is to expand on this system by adding features such as keyframe editing, redubbing elements of shots post-recording, UI for modifying world conditions (eg. weather, time of day) and export options so you can render your shots into actual video or image files. Are you making videos in Rust? Let us know how this tool can help you! AI The first phase of the AI rework is finished and it replaces multiple different AI systems across different game locations with a single new one. Making changes to an established game as big and complex as Rust is scary, especially due to the multiplayer nature, so there's bound to be some initial bugs. Please report anything you find and I'll get it fixed. The advantages of having everything running on one AI system are numerous, the main one being it should be easier to keep the AI updated going forwards. New features will be easier to add, and they will work across all of the AI, and not just for AI in certain areas or specific monuments. So whilst there's still plenty more to come in this area, there are already some new features such as animal packs to look out for. Rust+ IFTTT Rust+ now works with IFTTT! You'll be able to connect Rust to other apps, services, and devices through IFTTT to automate all kinds of tasks. For example, all of the deep sleepers who wanted Rust+ to have a louder alarm can now connect Rust's smart alarms to your actual smart home alarm, your bedroom lights, and other services which support IFTTT. The IFTTT integration depends on having Rust+ set up on your phone so you can pair your Rust servers - so if you aren't using it already, install the Rust+ app on your phone! Once you're all set up with Rust+ you'll need to create or sign into your IFTTT account and head over to the Rust service page on IFTTT where you can link Rust+ to IFTTT and then build applets. https://files.facepunch.com/lewis/1b0311b1/IFTTT%20Blog.png The current IFTTT integration does not support controlling smart switches at the moment - this is something we're looking into supporting in the future. Updated Animals The animals in Rust have sucked for far too long. They stand out more than ever now with the team dropping the amazing world revamp last month. We've updated them with brand new models and materials, as well as a fuzzy fur shader for the longer bits of hair. This gets culled beyond LOD0 so we don't anticipate a big hit on performance - in fact, in the process of updating we discovered each model had a lot of redundant bones which we've stripped out! https://files.facepunch.com/Taylor/1b3111b1/UpdatedWolf.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Taylor/1b3111b1/UpdatedStag.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Taylor/1b3111b1/UpdatedBoar.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Taylor/1b3111b1/UpdatedBear.jpg Along with the new models came the arduous task of updating rigs, skinning & animation. Some animals proved more challenging than others as the updated models correct issues in proportions of the previous models, which meant changing bone placements. Creating new controller rigs for the whole suite of animals would of increased the workload by months & also meant every single existing animation would have needed to be replaced just to get things functional. I decided to try and force the current rigs into submission for any animation updates, although as mentioned all redundant bones have been removed. The idles took quite a while to get something natural, but are a big improvement on what we have. I've also updated walks & some runs where possible, but this really is a baseline to build upon. I'll be looking to update more anims like attacks/cycles, and once the ai becomes more advance we can hopefully increase their motives/goals/states and I can start to add more animations to support this. There are also current issues with some of the code-based turn movement as well which I'd really like to improve and have a greater degree of control over. Improvements & Fixes Highlights Procgen Improvements & Fixes: Multiple Improvments & fixes To Procgen Generation Tree Minigame: Improved tree X markers positioning Solar Panel Update: Updated Solar Panel model Twitch Drops No Twitch drops this month, they'll resume in July. Hapis Island This has been a frequently asked question, as mentioned last month: Due to the huge world revamp Hapis Island is currently removed from the map pool while Petur works on bringing the map up to date with the new visuals. No update on this as of yet but progress is being made. Changelist New Demo shot system Contact system Rust+ IFTTT integration Fixed certain monuments sometimes spawning partially underwater Fixed terrain height artifacts that were causing extreme slopes on certain seeds Fixed edge case where tunnel entrance would not connect to tunnel network Fixed tunnel network gap when two stations were spawned right next to each other and a tunnel tried to cross them Fixed harbors and fishing villages spawning at ridiculous slopes Fixed edge case that could make rivers overlap each other Fixed being able to break Injured animation by playing a gesture Fixed demos over an hour not displaying time correctly in the demo list Fixed being able to shoot over a ledge while in a beach chair at extreme height differences Fixed some headgear blocking vision while injured (Lunar New Year masks, NVG goggles, etc) Fixed M39 viewmodel sometimes ejecting two shells every shot Sleeping players will no longer blink Fixed some potential gib errors when destroying bases (likely resulting in a disconnect) Fixed Storage Monitor bounds, often causing LOS to fail resulting in not sending the paring notification to app Don't spawn harbors in tight places where they end up adjusting the coastline opposite to them (looks bad, leads to glitchy topologies) Full rewrite of monument prefab prioritization when determining their spawn locations and which monuments not to spawn if there isn't enough space for all of them Changed giant excavator monument to default priority Changed mining_quarry_c monument to default priority Can now press Reload to change the colour of placed electrical wires and hoses Added a tooltip when first using a grenade to explain the controls Prevented tree X markers from travelling too far down the tree Ladder hatches that hit a vehicle while opening will now cancel their animation (like regular doors) Allow gestures to be used while mounted on Secretlab chair Reduced road vehicle wrecks to lessen the impact on roadside junkpiles Improved small battery placement Small battery can now be rotated before deployment Small battery can now be deployed on tables / boxes Censorplayerlist now enabled by default on servers Rock colliders improved, still requires continued work Icelakes not generating on procedural maps - this will be fixed in July's update. Bone error in SkeletonProperties - this is a harmless server warning which can be ignored. We're investigating the cause. ",

        "contents": "A Whole New World This month Rust has received a huge visual update, the biggest to date! From new terrain, trees, rocks, cliffs, decor, grass, monument reworks and so much more. This is the culmination of work by several people that took place on and off over the last couple of years. It greatly improves how the game feels and gives it a fresh look. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/04/8w86f1/WTrPrRvxpC%5B1%5D.jpg Most of the new visuals were developed alongside the transition of the game to the High Definition Render Pipeline of Unity (HDRP) that we subsequently dropped after unsatisfactory performance results. We didn’t want to waste the efforts made to make the game look better during that time and ported them to the current version of the game instead. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/04/3l84M1/b1pXYhuFHl%5B1%5D.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/04/3q92D1/desert1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/04/7T5691/gD3W5ykxRQ%5B1%5D.jpg We also took the opportunity in the last two months leading up to this update to fix a vast amount of long-standing issues revolving around monuments, world procedural generation, and exploits. For example, you'll find cliffs, road, terrain, river generation much improved. We re-worked some monuments completely such as the Junkyard, Satellite dish and integrated many of them inside the procedurally generated world more seamlessly than before. For example, you'll now see larger monuments and hubs now have bespoke subway tunnel entrances within their perimeter. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/04/7W98j1/1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/05/5K46t1/700580_20210407130726_1%20%28Medium%29.png https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/05/4409K1/700580_20210407133221_1%20%28Medium%29.png When it comes to performance, we did our best to keep the current status quo or improve upon it in some areas of the game. But since this update adds more content than it removes, we do not expect a major improvement in performance overall. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/04/4I10S1/preview-lightbox-swamp_cabins_003.jpg The Bandit Town is known for one if not the worst performance area, and this gave us the perfect opportunity to address this. We reduced the number of NPCs, reduced the forest density and completely remodelled the huts. This is only touching the surface of changes, and you'll find many more changes and new additions while playing. Junkyard Revamp & Crane The Junkyard monument has received a complete overhaul, our original vision just didn't work out as well as we hoped. Once we adding flight into Rust it only made things worse. The revamp should hopefully resolve all the commonly complained about issues and make it a hotspot for action. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/05/04/2b79D1/preview-lightbox-junkyard_033.jpg Not only did the Junkyard receive a complete overhaul we've also added a driveable crane that can pick up vehicles and drop them in the shredder located at the centre of the yard. Dropping cars into the shredder will yield scrap. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210506/revamp_junkyard_08.jpg - Moving the crane too far away from the Junkyard will destroy the crane Bush Displacement Since the HDRP content backport comes with much nicer foliage, we noticed during playtesting that bushes got in the way when building a base a lot more than with the old foliage. To counteract this, bushes are now removed when building on top of them. Of course bushes won't be gone forever and will automatically respawn in suitable locations around the map. This uses the same system as trees, which guarantees that a nice and even coverage across the map will be preserved and we don't end up with large areas that don't have any bushes at all. Nvidia Reflex Nvidia Reflex is now available! Reflex can be enabled via the options menu for all Nvidia users using GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer.

The Rust May update features the game's biggest graphical upgrade ever, and a few other notable changes, including a big Junkyard overhaul, more convenient landscaping, and - as ever - a swath of bug fixes. Rust's visual update is its \"biggest to date,\" developer Facepunch says in a press release. \"This is the culmination of work by the team over the last couple of years. It greatly improves how the game feels and we think gives it a fresh look.\" This update also revamps how monuments generate inside the procedural world for more seamless transitions between areas. Further details will be available on the <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/\">official blog</a> on May 6. In addition to the broader reworks for monuments, the Junkyard has gotten a complete overhaul. Among other things, it's gotten a drivable crane, which you can use to drop vehicles in a shredder for scrap.

Completing research bounties locally by scooping up resources will let you earn gold blueprint upgrades for the Rust-style weapons. The bundle also includes some skins for your player character and buggy inspired by Facepunch's title. Alongside these, the event challenges Dying Light players around the world to collaborate in taking out two new Rais' outposts and bandits, as well as finding some air drops in its world to earn themselves access to gold fire, gold freezing, and gold poison C4 dockets. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/dying-light-crossover\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/april-update-poker-gestures\">Rust's April Update adds gestures, poker tables, and Twitch drops</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/first-trailer-remake\">Rust fan remakes its original 'First Day' trailer, and it's spot-on</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/player-data-eu\">Rust player data lost following fire at European data centre</a> ",

        "contents": "The combination everybody needed! See what happens when two worlds of survival are brought together and meet in the midst of a zombie apocalypse! Don’t worry, though, we won’t leave you without proper equipment. Grab the free Rust DLC to get a set of unique items that will help you make it through the dangers of the unforgiving world. When your life’s at stake, there’s only one thing you can do—grab whatever you find and use it to your advantage. Like that Heavy Plate outfit that’s apparently all the rage and will show everyone around how inventive you are. Or the Salvaged Cleaver with which you’ll chop both zombies and bandits as if they were veggies (quick disclaimer: do NOT eat the zombies! Or the bandits!). Prefer fighting from a distance? Then shoot your enemies with the Custom SMG or the Rust Assault Rifle, the latest advance in unconventional weapon-making. And for the final piece of your survivor’s kit—the new buggy, Rust Bucket—the capstone of your engineering skills. You can be sure it’ll put to shame all who have ever doubted your talent as well as remind you that nothing is impossible. Even building a car in the middle of a post-apocalyptic wilderness. Now, let’s put all that equipment to good use and see just how long you can survive against flesh-hungry zombies and ruthless bandits. What’s more, the scientists from Rust must’ve heard about the Harran virus and have come to investigate the deadly pathogen. Surprise them with your amazing parkour skills and show them what you’ve learned from years of fighting the infected. They’re not the only enemies you’ll encounter, though. In both the Slums and the Old Town, you’ll find outposts full of Rais’ bandits. They’re dangerous places, but you’ve been to such by now, haven’t you? Crash through the front door and wreak havoc among the enemy lines or take them silently, through stealth. They won’t know what hit them, and you’ll leave with powerful elemental C4 explosives. You’ll use them better anyway, right? Still, surviving in Harran may prove harder than expected—but you already know that. Fortunately, you’re a skilled inventor and a full-fledged survivor. Who better to build something out of nothing than you? With the right materials, you’ll be able to research and craft improved versions of your weapons. Look for the necessary resources and let ’em see how deadly scrap can become in the right hands. The bundle contains: Heavy Plate outfit Buggy skin—Rust Bucket Short axe—Salvaged Cleaver SMG—Custom SMG Assault rifle—Rust Assault Rifle Global goal: Hunt down bandits (1 000 000). Reward: A docket for the C4 Elemental Variation Blueprints Local goals: Research bounties: Collect Scrap (30) and Plastic Tubes (2) Reward: Gold Rust Assault Rifle Blueprint Collect Scrap (20) and Nails (10) Reward: Gold Rust Custom SMG Blueprint Collect Scrap (10) and Tin Cans (5) Reward: Gold Rust Salvaged Cleaver Blueprint Raiding bounties: Find and raid Rais' Bandit Outpost in the Slums Reward: Elemental C4 Bundle Find and raid Rais' Bandit Outpost in the Old Town Reward: Elemental C4 Bundle The Rust crossover event and the Rust DLC will come to PC on April 19, 19:00 CET. The event’ll last for a whole week (until April 26, 19:00 CET). Both the crossover event and the Rust DLC will appear on consoles mid-May. What are you waiting for?

Well, maybe not those things specifically, but there's plenty to look forward to in this month's patch, including a brand new gesture system. The gesture system uses a pop-up wheel to give you a selection of emotes to use at just about any point in the game. Developer Facepunch says they've all been designed to be used in first-person perspective, and that you'll see a nice animation from that viewpoint when you wave or point at someone. The gestures can also be cancelled at any point, with a tiny time delay of about 0.2 seconds before you can fire your weapon again. \"Feel free to wave at your victim when roof camping\", Facepunch suggests. The April update also adds poker tables to Bandit Town, which Facepunch says completes work on overhauling the casino barge that began in March. Tables support 2-6 players, and you'll need to put up 100 scrap to sit down. Once you're in, it's Texas Hold 'Em rules all around, and you'll have a dedicated chat window for the table if you feel like talking a bit of smack to your fellow gamblers. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/april-update-poker-gestures\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/first-trailer-remake\">Rust fan remakes its original 'First Day' trailer, and it's spot-on</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/player-data-eu\">Rust player data lost following fire at European data centre</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/tunnel-dweller-rail-network\">Rust's March update adds an underground rail network and tunnel dwellers</a> ",

        "contents": "Gestures You can now express yourself with a new selection of gestures, available to everyone in a simple popup menu during gameplay. Just press B (by default) to open the menu and look at your options. These new gestures have been built to be used in first person, so you get nicely animated hand movements instead of just seeing your shadow gesture. This new system for gestures is a bit more flexible than the old system, and it has already supports some future features like looping animations and third person gestures. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/8fb8a95f/gesture_friendly.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/d10c2589/gesture_victory.jpg A core goal of this new gesture system was reducing as much risk as possible when using them during tense gameplay. Gestures will now no longer unequip your weapon and can be cancelled at any point, with a small (~0.2s) delay before your weapon is fireable again. Feel free to wave at your victims when roof camping! https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/04/01/3K61M1/RustClient_m3F9ekh7XB.jpg Fun fact: these gestures are all left-handed because they were initially meant to be used while holding the weapon at the same time (which is generally in the right hand), however we felt it limited our future options for gestures - clapping with one hand is tricky. As we felt that the quality of the legacy gestures weren't up to scratch compared to these new animations, we've made the decision to remove support for playing the old gestures. You can however still bind these new gestures using the same commands/keybinds if you don't want to use the gesture wheel. Poker Tables https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210330/rust_poker_table3.jpg We've added Poker Tables to Bandit Town this month, completing our casino barge overhaul that we started last month. You'll find a variety of tables supporting anywhere from two to six players. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210330/rust_poker_table2.jpg Deposit at least 100 scrap to the storage at your seat to get started. Once you're in a game, use the button prompts on the right of the screen to play. Standard Texas Hold 'Em rules apply. Be sure to take your winnings at the end of your session! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210330/pokertable_vm1.jpg While in a poker game you'll have access to a poker chat window for you to chat with your fellow players, and you can also use your mic. https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b3011b1/cards3.png Server Optimizations We've made a variety of optimisations on the server to improve performance when lots of players are online: Floating junkpiles will no longer process buoyancy if no players are nearby Better balanced server load when lots of turrets are scanning for targets Upgraded SQLite and removed lots of GC allocations in the connector code Update Facepunch.Steamworks with buffer pooling for swnet (Steam Networking only) Rewrite NetWrite to have less CPU overhead Add caching to TechTreeData since it could cause short CPU spikes on the server Got rid of some small GC allocations that happened every frame Slot Machines The Slot Machines we added to Bandit Town proved popular last month, but I wanted to make some changes to make it a more interesting experience. I've rebalanced the payout scale to have fewer possible rewards, but the chance of getting a proper payout (three matching symbols) should be much higher than before. The majority of scrap payed out last month was via the wildcard symbols which felt a bit unexciting. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/slotmachines_01.jpg I've also added a multiplier option, so you can increase your bet and multiply your winnings accordingly. You can change the multiplier on a machine when depositing your scrap. Be sure to check the spin cost before spinning on a new machine! Unity 2019.4.22 We've upgraded from Unity 2019.4.4 to Unity 2019.4.22 this week. This release contains mostly fixes, but we've been waiting for some of those fixes for a long time and they've finally been backported to our LTS version. If you notice any sort of compatibility issues you didn't have before, definitely let us know. Mac Improvements Over a year ago, we filed a bug report regarding Unity's graphics jobs feature causing a crash on macOS after a few minutes of gameplay. This has finally been fixed and backported, so we re-enabled graphics jobs on macOS. This should greatly improve performance. We also re-enabled incremental GC on macOS, which should reduce stalls from the garbage collector. We've had issues with this feature causing huge stalls in the past, which is the opposite of what it's supposed to do, so definitely contact us if you're playing on macOS and you notice any second-long stalls you didn't have before. Hapis Update We've tackled the Red Keycard shortage by making them available in all corners of the island again. In addition, we've added a marketplace and gambling den to the Compound. Viewmodel Jitter Fix The view model jitter is finally fixed. It's an issue that's as old as Rust itself (and no it wasn't on purpose). The reason that this happens is because of floating point precision, the further away from 0 you get, the less precise things get. Pretty much every game that has View Models, probably has some kind of hack to support them. In the past we didn't really think it was worth using hacks to fix it. HDRP was supposed to allow us to fix this kind of issue, but since we aren't going to be switching to HDRP I decided to see if I could fix it with some not so new Unity features that I'm pretty sure wasn't available when we started Rust. Improvements & Fixes Highlights Disable Blood Option - Blood can now be disabled through the options menu Player Hitbox Bug - Fixed projectiles fired at players joints not impacting News Menu Update - News section now displays the full content of the blogs Hostile Timer Reduced - Safezone hostile timer reduced from 30 minutes to 5 Heavy Armour Riding - Players can no longer mount horses with heavy armour equiped L96 Skinnable - L96 skins coming this month Team Member Mounting - Team members can now mount vehicles after purchased Vehicles Reposessed - Vehicles are now reposessed after 5 minutes instead of 2 Revolver & SAP Recoil - Tightened up recoil response on revolver/sap including animations HDRP Backport Beta In May 2019 the team set out on a mammoth task to explore and switch Rust over to Unity's HDRP pipeline. HDRP boasted many visual fidelity improvements and new tech, best of all it was said HDRP was more optimized resulting in better performance. Switching and updating all our assets over to HDRP was months of work but we figured it would be worth it in the end. Long story short after months of work, testing and profiling we never saw the performance gains we expected from HDRP, in fact, it was worse. Faced with this dilemma we took the difficult and long overdue decision to halt all progress on HDRP and begin to backport all the updated assets back to the current pipeline. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/03/30/0g47n1/2021-03-18-112319.large.nohud%20%28Custom%29-min.png After many more months we're now at a stage we feel the backport is approaching the final stages and ready for public testing and feedback. Wednesday, April 7th we'll be opening HDRP backport publically which will be available to play from the \"Rust - Staging\" client via Steam by opting into the \"Aux01\" beta branch. The backport has updated nearly all of the world objects, rocks, foliage, trees and even many monuments have received some love. Due to the nature of continued changes on the backport wipes will be frequent, we do not recommend regular play, at least until later into the month. Mapmakers be aware a number of assets have been removed/updated which may have an impact on your existing designs. If testing and feedback prove positive we'll be aiming to release the backport on Thursday, May 6th. We don't expect performance to be better than release but we also don't expect it to be worse. Easter Event https://files.facepunch.com/helkus/1b0811b1/hunt.jpg For the next week, every 24-38 hours in-game hours an easter egg hunt will begin. You'll have 3 minutes to collect as many eggs as you can. The top 3 players are given special eggs as a reward. These eggs can be cracked open for various types of loot ranging from scrap all the way up to an M249! If you don't make the podium, that's okay. The painted eggs you collect can be upgraded to Bronze eggs once you collect 10. If you collect 10 bronze eggs then you can upgrade to a silver egg, eventually all the way to gold! There are various items available to help you during your hunt. The Easter Basket will allow instant pickup of eggs and the Bunny Onesie and Ears will provide you an advantage via Egg Vision. Have fun! New Items This year we've added a new workcart themed Rustigé Egg and a Bunny hat with wobbly ears and eyes. https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/d5b44a0d/rust_easter2021_bg.jpg In addition to this weeks skins, You can find these items available on the Item Store ",

Suitably called the 'Rust: First Day' trailer, it's a pretty rough-n'-ready compilation of its different gameplay features - and, nearly eight years on, one fan has decided to lovingly recreate it, frame-by-frame. Rust fan TheManFrom_Mars (Square Earth, on YouTube) has posted his creation on the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> subreddit, explaining that, following a recent thread he posted about the original trailer, he was inspired to make an updated version of the clip, reflecting where Rust's at now. He says that his version is \"a personal homage that decided to make\", and that he's \"tried to keep it as close to the original as can\". And, as you can see in the below clips - original and remake - the Rust fan's recreation is spot-on. Using the same tune and kicking off with the same sounds of feet trampling through dirt, the fan trailer matches up every shot. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/first-trailer-remake\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/player-data-eu\">Rust player data lost following fire at European data centre</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/tunnel-dweller-rail-network\">Rust's March update adds an underground rail network and tunnel dwellers</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-player-count\">Rust has hit yet another player count record on Steam</a> ",

        "contents": "Rust and developer Facepunch Studios have experienced a catastrophic loss that extends to European players this week. A data center containing numerous servers for the game, as well as player save data, recently caught fire and was unable to be contained. The damage was irreparable and 25 Rust EU servers were caught up in the blaze. The issue took place at an OVH Cloud data center building late on March 9, as reported by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/olesovhcom/status/1369478732247932929?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OVH CEO Octave Klaba</a> (thanks <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-10-rust-developer-warns-large-amount-of-data-lost-in-devastating-server-blaze\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eurogamer</a>). Reportedly, firefighters were called to the scene, but could not control the fire as it overtook the building. Fortunately, all staff were safely evacuated from the building and no lives were lost in the incident. However, the building was unable to be saved and all servers inside were destroyed. As the incident took place, Rust developer Facepunch Studios reported being affected. While <a href=\"https://twitter.com/playrust/status/1369558033559412737?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">initial announcements</a> remained a touch hazy about exactly what was lost, it wasn’t long after that Facepunch concluded the true extent of the damage, revealing that 25 EU game servers had been lost along with the player data they contained. Update: We've confirmed a total loss of the affected EU servers during the OVH data centre fire. We're now exploring replacing the affected servers. Data will be unable to be restored. — Rust (@playrust) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/playrust/status/1369611688539009025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 10, 2021</a> It’s a pretty severe loss to say the least and leaves a lot of players with a lot of work in the game back at square one. Being the survival game that it is, building oneself up in Rust can take a long amount of time. The game hasn’t been without <a href=\"https://www.shacknews.com/article/94189/opinion-how-facepunch-failed-to-communicate-gender-assignment-in-rust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fundamental issues</a> over the years, but generally speaking, it still has an enormous player base across <a href=\"https://www.shacknews.com/article/115004/rust-will-be-coming-to-xbox-one-in-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">various platforms</a> of faithful players who have poured numerous hours into it. Unfortunately, it seems a large chunk of those players have no choice but to start over. The silver lining here is that no lives were lost in the incident. Facepunch Studios will be looking into replacements for the affected studios immediately. If there are any updates in information on this story, you’ll find them here at Shacknews. ",

        "contents": "This month we've added an underground transit system, slot machines, a new round of Twitch drops and more improvements and fixes. Rail Network You'll now find train entrances scattered across the world, typically you'll find entrances next to existing monuments. Upon the first inspection, they may not appear to be anything special but after venturing inside deep below the terrain, you'll now find a vast rail network with drivable workcarts. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210303/tunnel_entrance.jpg When entering the train entrances you'll notice the huge spiral staircases penetrating deep into the terrain, central to the stairs you'll find a much quicker, but perhaps less safe elevator shaft. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/tunnel_elevator.jpg Everything in Rust wants you dead, these tunnels are no exception. Upon reaching the bottom of the shafts you'll encounter some not so friendly tunnel dwellers. From this point forward you'll likely to encounter many more dwellers if you decide to continue exploring. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/tunnel_dweller1.jpg With risk comes reward, while the dwellers may be unwelcoming the loot they protect could well worth the risk. After exploring the shafts and tunnels you'll finally be standing at the rail platform. On each platform, you'll encounter more dwellers but increasingly better loot. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/tunnel_station2.jpg At the end of each platform, you'll find a driveable workcart. Consider this a first pass of a new dungeon system. Everything here is procedurally generated and we plan to add new track segments, bespoke entrances at each monument, puzzles, new NPCs, and eventually use this system to procedurally generate the cave network. Workcarts https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/workcart1.jpg Each station of the Freight Transit Line will have two workcarts facing opposite directions. Running on Low Grade Fuel, these can be used to rapidly traverse the map. There are 6 throttle settings (3 forward and 3 reverse) and the vehicle will remain in operation even after you depart the cabin. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/workcart3.jpg You may also encounter NPC barricades deep in the tunnel system. Be sure to slow down when approaching as hitting barricades or other work carts at high speeds will damage your workcart. Don't worry though, when a collision is imminent, a proximity alarm will sound and you can adjust the throttle accordingly. Barricades can be broken through without damage to your cart if approached at low speed. If you encounter a track junction, you can use your left or right strafe key to choose which track to follow. Lastly, damage will slow the speed of a workcart and it can be repaired with a hammer for metal fragments. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/workcart_shooting3.jpg Slot Machines https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/slotmachines_01.jpg Test your luck with 3 new Slot Machines in the gambling room of Bandit Town. To operate the Slot Machine you need to mount it and then deposit Scrap to start betting. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210228/slotmachines_02.jpg Each bet is 10 Scrap and the payouts range anywhere from 3 to 6k Scrap. Be sure to grab your winnings and any unused betting Scrap before leaving. Good luck! Server Browser As I'm sure many people are aware, there are quite a few issues with the server browser. You will likely never be able to see every Rust server out there due to the how Steam implements this functionality, but it can be improved. I made a few internal changes to the server browser to improve discoverability of servers: Empty servers are now hidden by default Unless you're on the official, friends, history, or favorites tabs (they will always be shown here) Note: This means you will need to enable showing empty servers sometimes The \"Show Empty\" filter will now apply filtering within Steam This means when \"Show Empty\" is off you should see no empty servers and see more of them Toggling the \"Show Empty\" filter will force a refresh of the community and modded tabs We also made the tags look less terrible. We're working towards a UI refresh for the server browser so the filtering will improve even more in the future. We're also always working on cleaning up the server list to remove servers that are spamming, advertising, or lying to try and get ahead. Server Performance Whilst looking through the server profiles recently, We noticed that certain entities were updating and sending data more than they needed to. Two of the biggest offenders were entities with buoyancy (boats) and horses. Now we try our best to not update them if there aren't any players around or they aren't in use. Combining these fixes with some fixes that Jarryd made with entity flag networking, servers should handle more players a bit better both in terms of CPU and bandwidth usage. Steam Family Share Players abusing Steam family share to circumvent bans and other malicious behaviour is not uncommon, on February 17th we disable Steam family sharing for the foreseeable future. We currently have no plans to re-enable Steam family share.

The heart of this update is a new underground rail network, which also brings us new features like workcarts and tunnel dwellers. If that's not enough, you're also getting slot machines you can use to gamble your scrap away. The rail network will introduce train entrances to major landmarks including the Launch Site or Military Tunnels, which you'll be able to easily locate on the map. Those'll lead you into the tunnels that house the rail system. You will find valuable loot down here, of course, but it will be protected by a population of angry tunnel dwellers. You'll also find two drivable workcarts at each station. Top them off with basic fuel and you can use them to travel along the tracks, and you'll be able to repair them if they take damage - which they probably will, since you can ram other carts that get in your way. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/tunnel-dweller-rail-network\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-player-count\">Rust has hit yet another player count record on Steam</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/softcore-mode\">Rust now has a kinder, gentler 'softcore' mode and shopping drones</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-everspace-2\">Rust and Everspace 2 lead the Steam top sellers</a> ",

New Year Items {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5377070/ad3d6b0dfc6f3acc36f015bf77b600d3c3efccf6.png In addition to this year's Ox mask, we’ve added items back from prior years sale to the item store, the Dragon Door Knocker, Gong, Fireworks Packs and the Chinese Lantern. Also, Don't forget Rust is currently 33% off in the Steam Lunar New Year Sale until the 15th February, now is the perfect time to get your friends involved!",

Last month, the title - which has seen a massive surge of popularity of late thanks to an uptick in streamer interest - hit a new peak concurrent player count record of around 245k players. Now, the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game's</a> average player count has soared to all-new highs. Head to <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/252490\">Rust's Steam Charts page</a> and you'll see that - as of writing - the game's average player count over the past 30 days has hit a new record high of 146,404 - <em>far</em> beyond averages seen on Valve's platform since its launch way back in 2013. It's also just over 4k beyond January's record-breaking average of 142,117 - an eye-watering leap from the regular figures between the 46-61k mark seen over the course of last year. Given it's still early February, we won't know for a good few weeks yet whether the average will stay this high across the month - and so, whether we'll see a new record average player for the whole of February. But, it's safe to say Rust's popularity isn't showing any signs of dying down any time soon. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-player-count\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/softcore-mode\">Rust now has a kinder, gentler 'softcore' mode and shopping drones</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-everspace-2\">Rust and Everspace 2 lead the Steam top sellers</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/player-count-record\">Rust has hit another all-time player count record</a> ",

First off, you'll be able to reclaim half your inventory after being killed, either by returning to the spot where you died, or by using a reclaim terminal found in the Bandit Town or Outpost safe zones.

Introduced yesterday as part of the February update, the Softcore mode provides a slightly more forgiving Rust experience. When a player is killed, instead of losing everything they will instead be able to recoup half their inventory - either at the spot of death, or at a reclaim terminal (at the Bandit Camp or Outpost monuments). You'll have two hours to reach a terminal before those items despawn, but still - it's far better than losing it all to someone with an AK. On top of this, players will also have the opportunity to spawn in the Bandit Town or Outpost safezones at any time (if they are not flagged as hostile). Rust is also pretty infamous for its zerg clans - groups with dozens of players that can easily overwhelm solos or small groups - and Softcore helps discourage this by capping team sizes at four. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-05-rust-gets-softcore-mode-to-make-things-less-brutal\">Read more</a> ",

        "contents": "If you hadn't yet noticed, Rust is having <em>a bit of a moment</em>. Although it's been around since 2013, the survival multiplayer is experiencing a resurgence in popularity after a bunch of high-profile streamers set up private server together. The streamers, including Shroud, Pokimane, Myth, XQc and more, have all uploaded their own perspectives of the island (even creating their own factions), making for compelling viewing - and seriously boosting Rust's player count in the process. Prior to the recent surge in popularity, Rust's previous Steam concurrent players record stood at <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/252490#1m\">125k in April 2020</a> (coinciding with coronavirus lockdowns), but on 8th January it smashed that record by peaking at 201,497 players. The numbers have continued to rise over the last week, and as spotted by <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/player-count-record\">PCGamesN</a>, the game hit 244,394 concurrent players on 16th January - breaking that record yet again. All this, of course, seems to be paying off very nicely for Rust developer Facepunch, with studio founder Garry Newman revealing the studio had made over $1m (£734k) on two days in one week. With the player count showing no sign of declining, I imagine this is going to be an extremely good month for the game. And we haven't even had the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-10-a-rating-for-the-console-release-of-rust-has-just-popped-up-on-the-esrb-website\">Rust console launch</a> yet. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-19-rust-breaks-its-own-steam-player-count-record-again\">Read more</a> ",

Now, that's been blown out of the water, with a new peak count of not far off double that figure. <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/252490#1m\">Steam Charts</a> shows that Facepunch Studios' <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-multiplayer-games\">multiplayer game</a> hit an all-time concurrent player count high on Valve's plaltform this past weekend, with the number topping out at an eye-watering 244,394 - significantly beyond the record set just a couple weeks ago.

Morals are loose, and a well-armed clan eager to steal your hard-earned loot is never far away. Yet there is hope to be found in this lawless land; tales abound of individual players defying the odds, outmanoeuvring and out-thinking their opponents to amazing results. Welyn, a popular Rust YouTuber, clearly fits this description. He's been making a name for himself within the community for his daring solo heists against much larger clans - typically, ones who have been throwing their weight around and harming the experience for other players. Like any good heist movie, Welyn's videos always start with the setup. He names the target, which can be anything from an overzealous clan blocking off a plot of land to a group of malicious players ganging up on someone underpowered. He then outlines a plan, with an annotated map or a detailed base recreation setting out his intentions. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/welyn-eco-raiding\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/base-building-guide\">Rust base designs are about more than just size</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-top-seller\">Rust overtakes Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam top sellers list</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/servers\">New Rust update adds more servers, brings Twitch Drops, and wipes your blueprints</a> ",

The <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival game</a> from developer Facepunch Studios is now the highest grossing game on Valve's store, some seven years after launch. In the <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2021W01/\">latest Steam top-sellers list</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 drops two spaces, from one to three, and Rust, which has been on the rise lately, has jumped from four to the tippy-top. This isn't terribly surprising, a resurgence on Twitch led to Rust breaking <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/player-count\">its player count record</a> during the week, a record that was <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/252490/graphs/\">broken again this weekend</a>.

The first update of the new year is a relatively small one, but it sets the stage for what to expect in the next handful of months. First off, be aware - you're losing your blueprints. The devs are \"force-wiping blueprints across all Rust servers\" as a result of the recent <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/tech-tree\">tech tree system</a>, to ensure everyone's once again playing on a level field. This is the first such wipe in years, and the <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/january-update\">devs say</a> it'll be a \"long, long while\" before it happens again. Rust is getting Twitch Drops now, too. Watching any Rust stream will get you three rewards: a sofa after two hours, an industrial door after four hours, and a hobo barrel after eight hours. Additionally, nine streamers now have personalised in-game items you can get by watching four hours of their respective streams: auronplay, jacksepticeye, lilypichu, ludwig, Myth, pokimane, shroud, Sykkuno, and xQc.

Rust has made a big resurgence on Twitch thanks to an international array of big-name streamers, and the new visibility has led to a new all-time player peak for the game on Steam. Rust reached a new peak concurrent player count of 134,483 today, as <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/252490/graphs/\">SteamDB</a> shows. That's not massively higher than previous records - daily peaks have tended to run from 70k to 100k throughout 2020, reaching as high as 125k back in April - but it's impressive to see a game that's been around for the better part of a decade continue to hit new records. On Twitch, however, Rust has been hitting astronomical heights, with peaks well over 1 million viewers. Prior to the past month, those peaks tended to be well under 100k. Those new view counts are buoyed by streamers including Shroud and xQc in a new communal server, for English-speaking audiences.

If you haven't been around for this before, here's what you can expect: Every once in a while you will hear the sound of jingle bells. Run outside and look for a gift! Two gifts are spawned per player, in a radius of about 40m from where you are standing. Run up and bash it open to receive your Christmas presents. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. If you have enough small presents stashed, you can \"trade up\" to a medium or large. The contents of each present vary, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and candy. We've also added wrapping paper allowing you to wrap up items as gifts to other players, perhaps sold in your vending machine... Once again, you will be able to find Santa hats and reindeer antlers, both of which can be worn and provide a decent amount of protection. There’s also a lickable candy cane club, and two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring the stocking will fill up with loot. The larger stocking has a higher chance for better items and both last around 5-10 refills. More details on the new items can be found on the link ",

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rust's</a> December update is a big one. It's replacing the experimentation system for blueprints with something that's a bit more reasonable: a workbench-based tech tree system, so that you can always be working toward the items you want to craft. As Rust creator Garry Newman explains in <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/tech-tree-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this week's blog post</a>, the tech tree update is meant to address the fact that the random experimentation system has proven to be frustrating and costly. Under that system, players could use scrap to 'experiment' and gain a random new blueprint. Now you'll be able to see the entire tech tree of items available from a workbench's tech level. That way, you can find the item you want and work toward it, without having to worry that your precious scrap is going to go to waste on a blueprint you don't need or want. New players ought to have a much easier time getting set up with useful blueprints from now on, rather than \"having to pray to the RNG gods to find a SAP in a crate,\" as Newman puts it. Great. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/tech-tree\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-halloween\">Rust's Halloween update is here, with a Trick or Treat event and spooky new items</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-elevator\">Rust gets an Elevator update and reworked map tomorrow</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/space-suit\">Rust is getting a space suit and an in-game gaming chair from Secretlab</a> ",

What's inside can vary across different types of loot - that is, you could discover some scrap, an M249, or anything in between. The update also adds some extra items you might find handy in your hunt, such as a pumpkin bucket that lets you instantly grab candies and a scarecrow wrap that'll give you an edge in spotting the treats \"via candy vision\"). <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-halloween\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-elevator\">Rust gets an Elevator update and reworked map tomorrow</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/space-suit\">Rust is getting a space suit and an in-game gaming chair from Secretlab</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/base-building-guide\">Building a base in Rust is about more than just size</a> ",

        "contents": "Rust, Facepunch Studios' multiplayer survival fest, gets a bit of a <em>lift</em> this week, with the arrival of its Elevator update. The update adds the deployable feature as an option for your player bases, as well as a rework for the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-survival-games\">survival game's</a> map, and a bunch of other goodies, too. The Rust Elevator update's eponymous new addition lets players travel easily between their base's different floors and levels, Facepunch announces in a press release, and it sounds easy enough to implement, too. All you have to do is plonk one on your settlement's ground floor, then stack multiple others on top of it to create a working elevator system. The release only mentions \"additional floors\", so it's not clear just how far you can go with this - but, hey, the sky's the limit, right? Once you've powered your elevator, you can move it one floor up or down at a time using the controller's respective buttons, or send it straight to the top or bottom of its shaft. You can also add power inputs to your various floors which you can use to call the elevator directly to them. Neat. Just make sure you don't hang around underneath the elevators when they're moving. Ouch. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-elevator\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/space-suit\">Rust is getting a space suit and an in-game gaming chair from Secretlab</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/base-building-guide\">Building a base in Rust is about more than just size</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/merch-contest\">Rust is turning fan designs into official merch</a> ",

There's a full space suit costume you can wear, and for maximum comfort, what looks like an officially-branded gaming chair from Secretlab. Rust YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsrOaKEdy0ymNqR7Urqa2Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ShadowFrax</a> has a helpful rundown of all the latest topline changes that have appeared on the staging branch, which is where Rust tests out upcoming patches. It's a reasonably certain indication of what will be showing up in the main game branch in the next patch, so all Rust players can probably expect to see these in October's update. First, the space suit. Like everything in Rust, it's a bit on the shabby side, but it works exactly like a standard hazmat suit - mainly because it is a standard hazmat suit. The astronaut appearance is a skin, and the design looks to be based on American space suits of the 1960s Apollo program. Admins and owners can try it on by using the command 'give spacesuit', which is nice and straightforward. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/space-suit\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/base-building-guide\">Building a base in Rust is about more than just size</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/merch-contest\">Rust is turning fan designs into official merch</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/modular-vehicle-update\">Rust players find ways to break everything, and now they have cars</a> ",

You should always consider how your designs will fail. After all, given the game's cutthroat nature, it's only a matter of time before your base attracts the wrong type of attention, whether that's an ambitious solo raider looking for a big score or a ruthless clan hoping to spread their dominance throughout the server. But not to worry, as this is where the Rust building community can help. A crack team of security experts, these individuals are obsessed with finding the best ways to lock down and defend your base. They draw on game exploits as well as careful planning to outwit and outmanoeuvre any potential thieves, and share what they learn in the form of useful tips. To bring you the very best advice, we reached out to a couple of Rust YouTubers to get their thoughts on base building in Rust and what players need to keep in mind when constructing their own bases. One of these was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZUfGWL1I1JzhqrpKjw8wzw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTuber Rust Daddy</a>. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/base-building-guide\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-top-seller\">Rust overtakes Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam top sellers list</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/servers\">New Rust update adds more servers, brings Twitch Drops, and wipes your blueprints</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/player-count\">After a resurgence on Twitch, Rust hits a new all-time player count record</a> ",

You'll now be able to acquire a Rowboat or a RHIB at one of the three new fishing villages we've added to the game. Here's the run down: You'll now find 3 Fishing villages around the map varying in size. Boats are no longer procedurally spawned along the beach and ocean and instead can be purchased from the Boat vendor found at the Fishing villages, 250 for rowboat / 400 for RHIB. Fishing villages are safe zones and hostile action will result in a swift death. If you're unable to afford a rowboat, you can opt to purchase the blueprint for a Kayak & paddle which you can then craft yourself any time. You can also purchase each piece of scuba gear at the fishing village Moving forward, you can expect to see some more NPC Villages added to the game (stables anyone?) as well as seeing the impact of these micro monuments have in the game increasing. We're working on a mission system which will allow players to acquire items and blueprints from means other than simply farming scrap, and you'll likely find the mission providers here first.

Gear up in some swimwear, take to the seas, relax by the pool, get into a water fight and take some photos to remember the summer! Just like the Instruments DLC everything included in this pack (except for the custom underwear) can be used by anyone, even if they haven't purchased the DLC. Make sure to craft some tubes for your friends! Custom Underwear https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200709/swimwear1.jpg We've added the ability for you to change your underwear as part of this update so you can swap out those grungy undies with some bright summer styles. You'll notice a new icon next to your player avatar in the Inventory where you can select from the available options. This works a little differently from normal items as it's not something you have to equip or craft, and your choice of underwear will be remembered when you die. There are 4 different styles to choose from with Male and Female versions of each. Boogie Board and Inner Tube https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/innertube1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/boogieboard1.jpg The Boogie Board and Inner Tube are two new deployable vehicles that let you take to the ocean in style. Pop one down in any body of water and you can paddle around to your heart's content. The Inner Tube is a bit slower but can turn easily, while the Boogie Board is built for speed but can't turn as well. You can also equip items while on an Inner Tube, so feel free to shoot your team mates with a water gun while catching some waves. The Boogie Board has 7 visual styles while the Inner Tube has 8 styles. Paddling Pool https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/paddlingpool1.jpg Once filled up, the Paddling Pool acts as a water source for your Boogie Board and Inner Tubes. Includes 5 different styles. Above Ground Pool https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/bigpool1.jpg The Above Ground Pool is a massive pool with plenty of space for aquatic activities. As well as including a large pool, it also includes a deck area where you can deploy other props like chairs, instruments and turrets. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/bigpool3.jpg Beach Towel https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/beachtowel1.jpg The Beach Towel is a new item that acts as a respawn point. While it works really well on the beach and by the pool, it will work anywhere you can use a Sleeping Bag. Comes in 8 styles so you can stand out on the beach. Beach Recliner, Parasol and Table https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/recliner1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/umbrella1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/beachtable1.jpg This furniture set includes three separate props to style your above ground pool. The Recliner is a large chair where you can kick back and relax, the Parasol is a large umbrella that reduces the temperature for any players underneath it, and the Table is a small surface that goes well with the rest of the furniture. The Parasol and Recliner have 8 different colour schemes to pick from. Sunglasses https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200709/sunglasses2.jpg Shield your eyes from the hot sun with the new equippable Sunglasses. Provides no protection, but they look really cool. Includes 9 different styles so you can really express yourself. Instant Camera https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/instantcamera1.jpg Snap photos of your summer fun with the Ontara Pro instant camera. You can write messages onto the photos and share them with others like notes. Each camera can take up to 30 photos. The camera has a zoom feature which can be adjusted by dragging with the right mouse button pressed. It can also switch between infinite, auto, or manual focus using the reload button. Manual focus can be adjusted with shift+right mouse drag. Photo Frames https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/photoframes3.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/photoframes1.jpg You can place your photos into these new deployable photo frames to show them off to the world.

Water Guns https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/watergun1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/waterpistol1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20200706/waterpistol3.jpg Water fights - to the death! Grab a water gun, fill it up from a water source and go on a splashing spree! Soak your mates or enemies (as long as they have a water gun equipped, too) enough and they'll start to take water damage. The water pistol has a low output and range, but doesn't require pumping. The larger water gun has increased range and output but will need pumping to maintain its extended range. The large gun comes in 5 colours for easy friend and foe identification.",

With this being a major new feature, we're releasing it initially in a separate version of the game, which is available to try right now. Our aim with this new beta branch is to allow for plenty of testing not just in terms of fixing bugs, but also in adjusting how the new vehicles fit into the game as a whole. Various aspects may potentially still change such as how they're acquired and used, or balance to their costs and statistics. Please be aware that right now there will be bugs and missing features in this branch. If you're trying out the vehicles branch, we'd like to get your bug reports, plus any suggestions for changes you think are needed relating to modular cars. The end goal is to have modular cars fit well into the game as something where the value is equal to the time and energy required to use them. Details of how to access the branch, what to expect and where to give feedback can be found on the Blog Page",

The painted eggs you collect can be upgraded to Bronze eggs once you collect 10. If you collect 10 bronze eggs then you can upgrade to a silver egg, eventually all the way to gold! There are various items available to help you during your hunt. The Easter Basket will allow instant pickup of eggs and the Bunny Onesie and Ears will provide you an advantage via Egg Vision. This year we've added two new Rustigé Eggs, each has a new monument with their own associated rust theme. We've also added a new Nest Hat which functions as a replacement for the wolf headdress.

The Small Fireworks package contains Roman Candles and Volcano style fireworks but if that isn't big and loud enough for you we've added a Large Fireworks package which contains Mortar style shells which create huge colored starbursts in the sky and can be seen for many miles. In addition to 5 different colors, the the Large Fireworks package also contains a Champagne style Mortar which creates the largest and most impressive display of pyrotechnics. In addition to this year's new items, we’ve added two items from last years sale back to the item store, the Dragon Door Knocker and the Chinese Lantern The Igniter is a new IO entity that you can use to ignite nearby items - including Fireworks, Campfires, Furnaces, Lanterns, unexploded Beancan grenades and Satchel Charges. While powered the Igniter will automatically start spraying out sparks, igniting anything in a radius that it has line of sight to. Use them to wire up remote firework displays!https://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/2020/01/23/252490_20200123093013_1.jpghttps://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/2020/01/23/rust_lunar2020_still_014.jpgMuch like the Tesla Coil, the Igniter takes damage while it's running so you won't be able to run it forever without repairs.An item like this would usually be released in a start of month update rather than an event update but we felt that the Igniter would be really useful for setting off fireworks so we brought it forward to this update.",

With Rust having grossed $142 million at 9 million copies sold, it has surpassed GMod at a humble $108 million. GMod has still outsold rust in terms of copies, however, with 16 million total sales. This might come as a surprise to some, because GMod is 15 years old this year, while Rust released in 2013. Doing the math, that means both games have sold over a million copies for each year of release, while Rust has sold 1.5 million for each year.&#xA0; The post also contains details on Facepunch&#x2019;s release from earlier this year, Chippy&#x2014;that sold about 10 thousand copies. Compared to other games from Facepunch that&#x2019;s not great, but it&#x2019;s pretty good for the post-indie apocalypse Steam environment. Anyways, here&#x2019;s the big Rust thing from this year: Horses. Who doesn&#x2019;t love a horse. Nobody, that&#x2019;s who.

If you have enough small presents stashed, you can \"trade up\" to a medium. If you choose to unwrap a present, the contents in each will vary. I won't blow the surprise here, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and candy.

There’s also a lickable candy cane club, and two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring the stocking will fill up with loot.

        "contents": "Quite frankly, I've been looking for an excuse to show off my piano skills on Eurogamer for some time - and this month the perfect opportunity fell right into my inbox. A few weeks ago, Rust - the survival game infamous for its anarchy and general brutality - added a <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-19-rust-is-getting-ten-new-playable-instruments-in-its-wholesome-first-premium-dlc\">surprisingly wholesome instruments DLC pack</a>, allowing players to construct a variety of instruments such as trumpets, drums... and pianos. This was already intriguing, but one line of the press release really caught my attention. The instruments accept MIDI input. Oh boy. Did this mean I could hook up an entire electric piano to a computer, and play live piano in Rust? I had to try it out. And, of course, it's the Christmas season - so to make it festive, and my life extra complicated, I announced to my editors that I would go carolling. Live. In Rust. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-12-16-i-went-christmas-carolling-in-rust-with-a-real-piano\">Read more</a> ",

        "contents": "The headline says it all: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\" target=\"_blank\">Rust</a>, the game about waking up naked and alone on a strange island, mere hours away from death due to exposure and starvation, now has tubas. And not just tubas! The game&apos;s first paid DLC, announced last month, also includes a piano, a drum kit, guitars, a trumpet, a pan flute, and other cobbled-together instruments&#x2014;all of them fully playable&#x2014;of the sort you&apos;d expect to find on a Gilligan&apos;s Island with guns. I&apos;m sure no one will annoy anyone with these. The Rust Instrument Pack goes for $10/&#xA3;7/&#x20AC;8 <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174370/Rust__Instruments/\" target=\"_blank\">on Steam</a> (although it&apos;s 10 percent off until December 12), and in a nice touch you don&apos;t need to own the DLC in order to enjoy the tunes. You&apos;ll have to purchase the pack to be able to craft the instruments, but once made they can be shared between all players or taken off of corpses as regular inventory items.&#xA0;Static instruments are also available on a new music stage in the Compound so everyone can give them a try. Unlike the squeezebox and fiddle in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbR-6HJ1sFA&amp;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\">Sea of Thieves</a>, for instance, which play preset tunes on a button press, these instruments in Rust can be manipulated more finely: &quot;They all use a completely overhauled music system that allows you to play specific notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) across multiple octaves,&quot; developer Facepunch explained. And if you happen to have a MIDI-compatible device lying around you can plug it into your PC and use it to interact with the instruments in a more musical manner. The acoustic guitar already in the game has also been converted to work with the new system. Here&apos;s what you can craft, and what it costs to do so: * Wheelbarrow Piano (200 Wood, 100 Metal Frags); * Junkyard Drum Kit (200 Wood, 100 Metal Frags); * Shovel Bass (50 Wood, 75 Metal Frags); * Sousaphone (100 Metal Frags); * Jerry Can Guitar (25 Wood, 50 Metal Frags); * Xylobones (50 Bone Fragments); * Plumber&apos;s Trumpet (75 Metal Frags); * Cowbell (35 Metal Frags); * Canbourine (25 Metal Frags); * Pan Flute (20 Metal Frags, 5 Cloth); The update also enables legs, which Rust developer Garry Newman gave us an unexpectedly horrific <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/witness-the-body-horror-that-allows-rust-players-to-look-down-and-see-their-legs/\" target=\"_blank\">behind-the-scenes look</a> at last month. &quot;Legs&quot; sounds simple enough, but like most things involved with game programming there&apos;s a lot more going on than meets the eye.&#xA0; As usual, there are a number of other fixes, changes, and additions in this update. Loading times have also been improved (although Newman noted, accurately, that if you really want to speed things up, buy an SSD), and horses are now better able to navigate rocks and radtowns&#x2014;although they might sometimes do weird things like, say, teleport onto signs (this is being worked on). And for owners of Garry&apos;s Mod, there&apos;s a new GMod Tool Gun, a hammer replacement to celebrate that game&apos;s 15th anniversary.

Rust is nearly 6 years old now and it’s got better every year with more people playing it than ever. In the last year or so alone we’ve seen vehicles from boats and hot air balloons to minicopters and also horses with horse armor. We added new areas like the Scientist Compound and the Bandit Town plus of course, Monuments like the Oil Rig. We put electricity in the game. In the last few months we introduced Killer Mummies at Halloween, the most epic trees you’ve ever seen and (soon) we’ve got our first ever DLC with musical instruments like the Wheelbarrow Piano and Canbourine. Also, Rust looks and plays a hell of a lot better than in Legacy days, so there’s that. We’re really grateful for all the support the Rust community has shown over the years and we hope this award will recognise that too. All you need to do is click the `Labor of Love 2019` box above for our eternal gratitude! https://files.facepunch.com/Holmzy/1b2711b1/torch.png",

        "contents": "It&apos;s fun to get a look at how the sausage is made in games, and <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rust</a> developer Garry Newman opened the doors to his butcher shop in a blog post today. <a href=\"https://garry.tv/rusty-legs\" target=\"_blank\">The post</a> reveals that Newman has wanted for years to let players look down in first-person and see their own legs while playing Rust, rather than traveling through the world as a disembodied camera in the same manner as most first-person games. &quot;We have a skeleton with the player model on it (which is what casts the localplayer shadow),&quot; the post reads. &quot;We want to show it, but we also want to manipulate the bones in a way that they don&apos;t conflict with the player&apos;s view. But if we do that the shadow would be all fucked.&quot; The solution Newman finally came up with? Rendering a different model. &quot;So what we do is basically copy the third person model (which creates the shadows) and manipulate the bones. The manipulation isn&apos;t anything complicated, it&apos;s just a case of tucking shit behind the camera,&quot; Newman writes. <em>Above: </em><a href=\"https://garry.tv/rusty-legs\"><em>Gif made from video at Garry.tv</em></a> &quot;There&apos;s a couple of extra things we have to do. When you&apos;re crouched and look down, we pull the viewmodel back so it doesn&apos;t clip through your knees.&quot; While that solution does indeed look convincing from a first-person perspective (above), it&apos;s both funny and a little alarming to see what&apos;s happening behind the scenes to achieve it: <em>Above: </em><a href=\"https://garry.tv/rusty-legs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gif made from video at Garry.tv</em></a> As you can see, the player&apos;s shadow is intact and both it and their body will look perfectly normal to them, but &quot;tucking shit behind the camera&quot; technically turns the player into a weird stretched taffy monster. It&apos;s reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2an7rt/third_person_crouching_in_crysis_2/\" target=\"_blank\">the disturbing gymnastics required to let players peer over cover in Crysis</a>. You can read the full post for more behind-the-scenes magic (there&apos;s a reason the models above don&apos;t show the player&apos;s arms) <a href=\"https://garry.tv/rusty-legs\" target=\"_blank\">at Newman&apos;s blog</a>. And while we&apos;re on the topic of Rust, we also learned this week that it&apos;ll release its first paid DLC next month, which will contain <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust-is-getting-its-first-paid-dlc-musical-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\">10 new playable musical instruments</a>.

The first premium DLC for Rust will feature playable musical instruments, 10 of them in all, including a piano, drums, sousaphone (pictured above), and yes, even a cowbell. The premium DLC will cost $10, though <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/instrument-pack-dlc\" target=\"_blank\">Rust&apos;s devblog</a> says it will be initially discounted. The DLC will arrive on December 5, though the instruments are available now to play with and try out for free on Rust&apos;s staging server branch. These aren&apos;t just instruments where you hold down a key and they automatically play a song. &quot;We&apos;ve created a whole new control system to play the instruments,&quot; the devblog says. &quot;You can now bind the standard note range (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) to any key. From there you can bind sharp and octave modifier keys which allow you to play over 20 notes on some instruments.&quot; This new music system will be applied to Rust&apos;s existing acoustic guitar as well when the DLC arrives. You can also plug in a MIDI device and play some of the instruments in real time. &#xA0; Here&apos;s a look at some (nude) players in a jam session: Even if you don&apos;t purchase the DLC, there are still ways to join in on the fun. If a DLC owner crafts a musical instrument for you (or if you murder someone and take theirs) and you&apos;ll be able to play it.&#xA0; And if you&apos;re worried about being hounded at all hours of the night by roving sousaphone and xylophone players, no need to worry. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErrnieGerrn/status/1196835131358687232\" target=\"_blank\">Facepunch&apos;s community support manager Errn tweeted</a> that the instruments will have their own dedicated volume slider. Here are the rest of the instruments in the DLC: The Plumber's Trumpet The Canbourine The Shovel Bass The Wheelbarrow Piano The Junkyard Drumkit The Pan Flute The Jerry Can Guitar The Cowbell Xylobones ",

Horse armor will help protect your steed from incoming damage as well as providing additional protection for the rider (&quot;This might seem like it isn&apos;t very realistic, but it doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; reads the dev blog). There are two types of horse armor, one made of wood, and the other (and far more fun) is the armor made of road signs seen above. You can also craft horseshoes, which will make your horse faster, and saddlebags, which will increase your horse&apos;s inventory size but reduce their max speed. As is always the case with Rust updates, there&apos;s plenty more to it, including changes and improvements to the electrical system, tweaks to weapon balance, exploit fixes, and more. <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/october-update\" target=\"_blank\">View all the changes here</a>.

You'll have 3 minutes to collect as many eggs as you can. The top 3 players are given special eggs as a reward. These eggs can be cracked open for various types of loot ranging from scrap all the way up to an M249! If you don't make the podium, that's okay. The painted eggs you collect can be upgraded to Bronze eggs once you collect 10. If you collect 10 bronze eggs then you can upgrade to a silver egg, eventually all the way to gold! There are various items available to help you during your hunt. The Easter Basket will allow instant pickup of eggs and the Bunny Onsie and Ears will provide you an advantage via Egg Vision. I hope you guys enjoy playing this minigame as much as we enjoyed getting it ready for you. Have fun!",

        "contents": "It&apos;s been five years since Rust arrived, treating players to dangling dongs, rampaging bears, and a ruthless multiplayer survival experience. To celebrate this anniversary, a big, world-altering update is now live. Electricity has been added to the mix of tree-chopping, rock-breaking, gun-crafting, base-building, and (recently) <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust-now-has-hot-air-balloons-and-missiles-that-can-shoot-them-down/\" target=\"_blank\">hot-air ballooning</a>. Also, you can now wear underpants. <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/electric-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">The Electric Anniversary</a>, as it&apos;s called, is now live and contains a number of electrical components: batteries, switches, pressure pads, splitters, timers, and other various odds-and-ends that will allow players to use electricity to power lights, automation, clocks, CPUs, defenses, traps, and god knows what else. Power generation is currently (ha ha, current) supplied by solar panels and windmills. Here&apos;s a nice video from Rustafied to introduce you to the basics. Along with the exciting new electrical components, the update adds an M39 rifle, provides an overhaul to how bows work, brings some improvements to the cargo ships, and as I said earlier, adds underwear. This last item (called a censorship option in the devlog) should be helpful for streamers who are penalized for showing bare butts, wangs, boobs, and muffs while playing the game for others. Finally, in <a href=\"https://facepunch.com/blog/2018\" target=\"_blank\">a post on Facepunch</a>, Garry Newman delivered some stats about Rust&apos;s development. In five years, Rust has sold 7,457,075 copies, grossing $110,313,646, which includes bundles, DLC, and in-game sales. Its highest concurrent player count was 71,801, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust-soars-to-all-time-high-player-count-after-hot-air-balloon-update/\" target=\"_blank\">just this past month following the balloon update</a>. It&apos;s also sold over 4 million skins, and the creators of those skins have earned nearly $2 million combined from those sales. That&apos;s some shockingly (electricity, get it?) good news. ",

Looking at data from <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/252490#1m\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Charts</a>, you can see a definite spike around the time of the release of the latest update. You can also see that this is the first time it&apos;s pulled in more than 70,000 players at a time: its previous peak was around 68,000 in February, when it left Early Access (<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust-review/\" target=\"_blank\">here&apos;s Luke&apos;s review</a>). I&apos;ve never played Rust, but jumping in a hot air balloon with some friends to glide calmly over an enemy&apos;s base at the start of a raid sounds like fun. The SAM missiles sound like they&apos;d be a pain, though&#x2014;they just automatically fire on any balloon that comes near. Surely everyone can just stick one on their base, completely negating the balloons? I know they cost resources, but I assume anyone with a base worth robbing will be able to afford them. Is that the case? If you&apos;ve had a go with them, let me know in the comments below. ",

You&apos;ll find them scattered around the map, and once they&apos;re fueled you can fly wherever the wind carries you. Balloons should hold about four or five passengers, making them the ideal way to soar above the defenses of a fort you&apos;d like to raid. But every Sherlock has his Moriarty, and you may find your balloon shot down thanks to the inclusion of surface-to-air missiles, which also arrived in the Rust update. You can purchase a deployable SAM site from scientist outposts for 500 scrap and once stocked with ammo it&apos;ll automatically target any nearby balloons. Note: this includes your <em>own </em>balloon. SAMs aren&apos;t psychic. They just love killing balloons, so they&apos;ll shoot yours down too. So remember to either unload the SAM site before you launch, or just don&apos;t fly anywhere near your own fort. ",

It will approach the island to a distance of about 200 meters, at which point you can ride out to it on a boat of your own and climb aboard via one of the ladders hanging down its side. At that point, you&apos;ll have to clear the defenders, hack two locked crates, and defend the ship while you&apos;re waiting for them to pop. &#xA0;&#xA0; One further complication: Everyone else on the server can hear the boat &quot;from kilometers away&quot; and see it on the map, and that could possibly open the door to opportunistic behavior on the part of unscrupulous competitors. Not that we&apos;d expect something like that to happen in Rust, right? Best to be cautious, though&#x2014;better safe than sorry.&#xA0; Oh, and there&apos;s a spot of radioactive waste on board as well. Once your radiation alarm goes off, it&apos;s time to go.&#xA0; The update also brings a new bolt-action rifle, the L96, with &quot;extreme projectile velocity and range with very little damage drop off or bullet drop,&quot; making it particularly effective when paired with a scope. Speaking of which, there&apos;s also a new 8X rifle scope, a few different types of new gloves (including Tactical Gloves that eliminate aim sway), an additional clothing slot, and a handful of tweaks and optimizations. &#xA0;&#xA0; Rust&apos;s &quot;Cargo Ship Update&quot; is live now.

        "contents": "<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> is interesting, and also infuriating, largely because it is completely without rules. Players can work cooperatively, and they can also murder each other without penalty. Trading is a big part of surviving, and getting shot in the face while you&apos;re trying to do a deal is a big part of not surviving. What&apos;s a poor soul, dropped naked and alone into the midst of a cold, rocky wilderness, to do? The new Compound update promises to help alleviate the stresses of such no-holds-barred business by adding a place where players can safely interact under the protective watchful eye of heavily-armed scientists. It will provide useful services and facilities including a refinery, workbenches, a recycler, a water-catcher, and vending machines that sell basic survival resources, and also a place where you can just kick back and be social if that&apos;s your thing. &#xA0;&#xA0; The rules are simple: No weapons, no looting, no killing, and no sleeping inside, or directly outside, the compound. Follow the rules and you can hang out to your heart&apos;s content. Break them, and the scientists (and their turrets) will kill you dead. You&apos;ll be marked as hostile for five minutes and the status will persist across death, meaning you can&apos;t rush back into the compound immediately after you die: The only option once you&apos;ve been marked is to wait it out.&#xA0; Facepunch acknowledged that the compound is &quot;probably going to be gamed pretty hard,&quot; but said that it will continue iterating on it in order to stay abreast of players trying to dick around with the system. It also pointed an amusing finger at the player base for forcing developers to take this step in the first place: &quot;We originally intended for people to set up these kind of zones with peacekeeper turrets, but after a year and no-one bothering we took matters into our own hands.&quot;&#xA0; The update also adds a four-piece set of scuba gear to the game that facilitates underwater operations, and underwater rock formations, because what&apos;s the point of scuba diving if there&apos;s nothing down there to see? Full details on all the new content and gameplay changes including first-person clothing models, new AI for compound scientists, and updated chainsaw sounds, are up at <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/compound-update/\">facepunch.com</a>.

        "contents": "Rust, the multiplayer survival game from Facepunch Studios, left Early Access back in February but is still receiving updates and additions (which makes sense since creator Garry Newman <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust-will-leave-early-access-in-february-but-its-not-finished-yet/\">still considers Rust to be in alpha</a>). Chugging into Rust in an update this week is its first player-controlled vehicle, a motorized rowboat. Boats are not craftable, so you&apos;ll have to go out and find one: they will spawn along the coastlines of the island map. The boat has room for a driver and up to three passengers. Boats require low grade fuel to power their motors, and if left out in the elements a boat will decay in about three hours. If you find one and want to keep it you&apos;ll need to build a boathouse, <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/vehicle-update/\">this post on Rust&apos;s devblog advises</a>. Servers may spawn as many as 64 boats at a time, so it doesn&apos;t sound like they&apos;ll be in terribly short supply, however. To give you a little something to do on your boat, servers will also spawn floating piles of junk on the open water, so you can do some looting while you&apos;re cruising around. There&apos;s a compartment built into the bow of the boat to store your haul. Boats can sink, naturally, if they take too much damage, but they can also be repaired with a hammer, wood, and metal fragments. <a href=\"https://www.rustafied.com/updates/2018/4/3/boats-in-rust-what-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">You can find lots more info about Rusts&apos;s boats in this post on Rustafied</a>.&#xA0; ",

The update&#8217;s also good news for landlubbers who&#8217;d prefer to lead a woodland hike, as it improves and expands forests.

        "contents": "Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I&apos;ve ever played. You are naked and alone on the world&apos;s silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you&apos;ve also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you&apos;re particularly industrious, you&apos;ll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone&apos;s throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources&#x2014;the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign. But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It&apos;s another idiot in Rust.&#xA0; I don&apos;t know what it is with this game. Maybe it&apos;s the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it&apos;s the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it&apos;s the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you&apos;re spotted by an idiot, you&apos;ll start hearing the shit-talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you&apos;re hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement. It&apos;s so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn&apos;t love it. I wish I could say that it didn&apos;t feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn&apos;t know I was carrying), and put him down with a single well-placed strike. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I didn&apos;t laugh my ass off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, &quot;<em>Hey man, wait a second!</em>&quot; I wish I could say I didn&apos;t kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn&apos;t mean that as an endorsement. If it feels like we&apos;ve been living with Rust for a long time, that&apos;s because we kinda have. The game was first released in Early Access in late 2013 by developers Facepunch Studios, and it&apos;s been a mainstay of goofy YouTube send-ups ever since. If you&apos;re somehow unfamiliar with the premise, think of Rust as a dumber, more nihilistic Minecraft. You wake up on a map armed with only a rock and a torch. You quickly figure out that, by banging your rock on a few environmental doodads, you can harvest a few basic resources (stone, wood, and cloth) which you can parlay into a few prehistoric instruments, like a spear or a hatchet. This is similar to the scrounging mechanics in plenty of other survival games, but what makes Rust different is how deep that tech tree goes. Eventually, from those same basic ingredients and a few mechanical leaps of faith (like work benches and furnaces), you&apos;ll be able to craft pistols, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers. Rust famously does not quarter off its servers to keep entry-level nakeds away from the roving troops suited up in advanced firearms, which means that occasionally, your journey will end with you matching another player&apos;s revolver with a rock that you&apos;ve tied to a stick. This is the heart of Rust. Wake up naked, run for your life, do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative, or mythos, or win condition. Most of the servers are on a strict weekly or monthly reset schedule, which scrubs the island of any lingering housing or fortifications left behind by the players, which gives the experience a strange sense of futility. Yes, you will need to manage your hunger, thirst, and health&#x2014;and as you ratchet up the tech tree you will discover increasingly effective ways to stay alive&#x2014;but that&apos;s it. Sure there are some areas on the map that are stricken with radiation, which leads to the implication that perhaps you and the rest of your misanthropes are occupying a far-flung, post-collapse society, but those moments feel more like window dressing than anything else. I spent the vast majority of my time in Rust playing solo, but I don&apos;t want to discount the notorious community of players that band together in clans, and wage wars of aggression along the shared hunting grounds. One of the fascinating kernels of Rust&apos;s brutality is how everything in the world remains persistent, even if you&apos;re logged off, which means that smart players arm their bases with land mines, punji sticks, and keypad locks while they&apos;re away. (Some clans even recruit players across all time zones, to make sure there&apos;s always someone on guard.)&#xA0; That&apos;s a coordination I appreciated from a distance. There are a number of YouTube documentarians<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ht6StumKo\"> showing off the multi-man raids </a> that spawn from committed Discord channels all over the world. Instead, I engaged with the population of Rust on a purely incidental level. An extremely geared man takes pity on you, and drops a crossbow at your quivering feet. That&apos;s Rust! A kid and I are raiding an abandoned gas station for food and weapons, and I give him the extra pair of pants I was carrying around. When I&apos;m turned the other direction, he bashes his rock right through my skull and runs off with the rest of my stuff. That is also Rust. I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. Given the tone, it shouldn&apos;t be surprising that the community I found in Rust tended to be fairly juvenile and toxic. There&apos;s a high concentration of racism and misogyny in the global chat, so much so that I eventually left the channel entirely.&#xA0; And unsurprisingly, the new player experience is quite prickly. The development team didn&apos;t spend any time cooking up a tutorial (which makes some sense, when you consider how long the game has been available). Instead, when you join one of the many servers, you&apos;re presented with a few faint hints in the top-left corner of the screen: &quot;harvest wood!&quot; &quot;build a hatchet!&quot; The crafting system itself is fairly intuitive, with well-written tooltips for each of the items in the catalog, and you can fast-track yourself into some serious munitions if you get lucky with a few resource spawns. The PvP combat won&apos;t win any awards, but it&apos;s tactile and packed with wonderfully sadist bone-crunching sound effects&#x2014;connecting your hatchet with an idiot&apos;s head feels great, and really, that&apos;s all I needed. <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/252490/browse/\"> There is also a strange post-release monetization model, </a> in which you can buy ugly paint-jobs for your weapons and clothing. Rust is fascinating for a hundred different reasons, but Counter-Strike<em>-</em>style weed-leaf AWPs isn&apos;t one of them.&#xA0; Still though, I think everyone should at least have a taste of Rust. It&apos;s hard to think of many other games that are this uncompromising in its worldview, and I&apos;m utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. We could build a utopia on this island! We could cast aside our weapons, and construct a peaceful commune where everyone is fed, warm, and loved. I love how Facepunch dangles that potential in front of our face, with no real incentive pushing us in any direction. If we are to dehumanize ourselves, and turn this Eden into a battlefield, we will do it on our own terms. In Rust there is a real sense of complicitness when you eventually succumb to violence, more potent than in any other survival game on the market. Despite the lack of rankings to chase, or K/D to nurture, or exclusive vendors to unlock&#x2014;despite the unassailable fact that none of this will matter as soon as the server is wiped&#x2014;we are at war, and we always will be.

        "contents": "Multiplayer survival game <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\" target=\"_blank\">Rust</a> has finally left Early Access, increasing its price from $20 to $35 and tweaking its update schedule from weekly to monthly to ensure changes are properly thought through. There&apos;s now a testing branch, too, for those that want to trial new features before they make it into the game. And you can still expect a lot of new additions: creator <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rust-will-leave-early-access-in-february-but-its-not-finished-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">Garry Newman said last month</a> that the transition from Early Access to full release &quot;was more like leaving Prototyping and entering Alpha&quot;. The biggest change to accompany that transition is a graphics refresh. Environment artist Vincent Mayeur wrote <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/devblog-197/\" target=\"_blank\">in a blog post</a> that he has rethought the visuals &quot;from the ground up, combing over almost every aspect of the game, striving for consistency&quot;.&#xA0; He said that visual consistency had been eroded throughout development because of the need for constant changes, many of which didn&apos;t match up, so he&apos;s &quot;undoing what it has become and starting afresh&quot;. In practice, what that means is improved lighting, a refresh of the colour palette and post processing, prettier rocks and foliage, and lots of new types of trees dotted around the landscape.&#xA0; Away from graphics, the team have reworked weapon recoil. Previously, your aim would sway randomly every few second while aiming. Now, it will only sway if you haven&apos;t fired for several seconds, so you&apos;ll be able to track a target and tap fire knowing that your gun isn&apos;t going to start jumping all over the place. This will perhaps make it easier to kill enemies if you get your hands on a rifle, although the AK47 now has slightly more recoil overall. There&apos;s a whole list of other, more minor changes (including giving out squishy frog boots to anybody that bought the game in Early Access), which you can read about in that <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/devblog-197/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.

And that can probably be summarised as 'not all that much, beyond a price increase'. \"We're not planning any big reveals, launch parties, around the world tours or cash prize giveaways for this event. We're not going to move staff onto other projects\", explained Newman, \"It's very much going to happen without much fuss. It's business as usual.\" <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-22-rust-is-leaving-early-access-next-month-after-four-years-in-development\">Read more&hellip;</a> ",

        "contents": "The multiplayer survival game <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> debuted on Steam in December 2013. Now here we are in 2018, &#xA0;and wow, it&apos;s still there. Not for much longer, however, because believe it or not creator Garry Newman <a href=\"https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/leaving-early-access/\">announced</a> today that it will go into full release on February 8.&#xA0; Predictably, Newman said that development will continue after the 1.0 release, but the update schedule will change from weekly to monthly, to help reduce the likelihood of &quot;rushing in features and fixes that end up breaking something else.&quot; For those who prefer to live dangerously, a &quot;Staging Branch&quot; of the game with daily updates will exist alongside the stable main branch. It&apos;s basically a PTR&#x2014;Public Test Rust, if you like&#x2014;that never goes away.&#xA0; &quot;You can have both versions installed at the same time, so our hope is that we&apos;ll get one or two servers on the staging version that are populated all the time and help test the updates that are coming to Main at the end of the month,&quot; Newman explained.&#xA0; Despite the big step, he also very clearly wants to keep expectations under control. &quot;Please try not to compare the game to some other finished game or some idealized version you have in your head. Compare the game now to how it was when we entered Early Access. That&apos;s the delta that we feel qualifies us to leave Early Access,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Think of it more like we&apos;re leaving Prototyping and entering Alpha.&quot; The full release of Rust will be a quiet affair, with no launch parties, surprise reveals, or other such shenanigans&#x2014;&quot;Business as usual&quot; is how Newman described it&#x2014;but there will be a price increase, from $20 to $35. &quot;It sucks, it&apos;s going to cost more, but this was always the deal. And it&apos;s not like we&apos;re increasing the price to $60 without any warning,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is one of the main reasons we&apos;ve decided to post this blog rather than quietly slipping out of Early Access, we felt like this is something you&apos;ll all want to be warned about.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;Thanks to everyone that took the risk by buying our Early Access game. It hasn&apos;t always been the most stable, optimized, balanced experience&#x2014;but we hope you don&apos;t feel like we&apos;ve let you down.&quot;&#xA0; ",

I feel like, despite my own lack of Rust experience, sitting in chairs is not a core part of the Rust survival game experience. I was kind of hoping that the game was taking an unexpected detour into the ancient sport of trying out furniture while a sales assistant hovers nearby but apparently it&#8217;s part of a mounting system intended to help with vehicles and their attendant need for seated interactions. I preferred my idea. <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/09/15/rust-sitting-lakes/#more-477411\" class=\"more-link\">(more&hellip;)</a> ",

        "contents": "PlayerUnknown&#x2019;s Battlegrounds may have popularised the genre inspired by the Japanese movie, but it&#x2019;s not the only battle royale game pitting players against each other in desperate fights to the death. Below are 11 games, modes and mods that you should check out if you can&#x2019;t get enough of hunting your fellow man. GAMES PlayerUnknown&apos;s Battlegrounds Let&#x2019;s get the current top dog out of the way first, shall we? <a href=\"https://www.playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu\">PlayerUnknown&#x2019;s Battlegrounds</a>, or PUBG, is still in Early Access, but it&#x2019;s already swallowed up the lives of millions of players. In each match, 100 survivors are air dropped into a bucolic Russian island, seemingly abandoned during or just after the Soviet era. It&#x2019;s a huge place, but the play area is always shrinking, forcing players to race towards safety on foot or using cars, bikes and boats, all while trying to murder each other with a wide range of guns and melee weapons. It&#x2019;s a game filled with long moments of quiet tension, punctuated by chaotic, nerve-racking battles. H1Z1: King of the Kill Another Early Access game, <a href=\"https://www.h1z1.com/king-of-the-kill/home\">H1Z1: King of the Kill</a> was spun out of Daybreak&#x2019;s zombie survival game. The survival aspect became its own separate game, Just Survive, while the more competitive, PvP side of things became King of the Kill. Frenetic and fast-paced, it&#x2019;s more of an arena shooter than a game like PUBG, so you won&#x2019;t have to wait long to get into a gunfight. Brendan &#x201C;PlayerUnknown&#x201D; Greene was also a consultant on H1Z1 before making Battlegrounds. Ark: Survival of the Fittest Like H1Z1, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/407530/ARK_Survival_Of_The_Fittest/\">Ark: Survival of the Fittest</a> is another arena-style battle royale game, and is similarly a spin-off. Its hook, not surprisingly given its progenitor, is that there are dinosaurs and monsters to watch out for, as well as 71 human adversaries potentially hunting you down. Other elements from Survival Evolved have made it in, too, including riding and taming creatures, tribes and traps. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s struggled to retain its playerbase in the face of PUBG. The Culling If you prefer battle royales of the more intimate variety, there&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://theculling.com/\">The Culling</a> and its 8-player and 16-player blood-soaked arenas. Though it&#x2019;s fast-paced, there&#x2019;s still time to craft equipment and set traps. The central conceit is a big draw, too, set as the game is in a crazed game show for sadists. It&#x2019;s been in Early Access since March 2016, and while it was popular initially, it looks like player numbers might be on the wane. Last Man Standing Budget PUBG is probably the clearest way to describe <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/506540/Last_Man_Standing/\">Last Man Standing</a>. It&#x2019;s set on an island with 100 players trying to kill each other, the play area is a big circle that shrinks over time, mods can be scavenged and attached to guns, it&#x2019;s got loot crates&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a long list of similarities, but Last Man Standing is free. It&#x2019;s not quite as polished as its premium counterpart, however. GAME MODES GTA Online, Motor Wars GTA Online recently got a competitive mode called Motor Wars, which has some similarities to popular battle royale games: a shrinking kill box, arriving from the sky, then finding the best weapons possible on the ground. The key difference is that it&apos;s more focused around vehicle combat, and all the cars are marked on the map, as well as the players driving them. The shrinking kill space provides a similar amount of tension, though, and there&apos;s tons more potential in building on the idea, given the size of the map they&apos;ve got to play with. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-onlines-pubg-style-mode-is-not-as-good-as-pubg/\">Sam had fun with it</a>, even though it has some flaws. Fortnite Epic has announced a new battle royale mode for their base-building romp, Fortnite. It&#x2019;s due out this month and will see up to 100 players duking it out until there&#x2019;s only one left. The mode was put together by Epic&#x2019;s Unreal Tournament team, who were busy experimenting while Fortnite was in development. The scavenging and building from the game&#x2019;s regular mode will also feature in this new one, so you&#x2019;ll be able to create bases and fortifications to hole up in while you wait for everyone else to die. They&#x2019;ll probably be doing the same, mind you. Unturned <a href=\"https://smartlydressedgames.com/\">Unturned</a> is a blocky, free-to-play zombie survival game, but it&#x2019;s also got a battle royale arena mode. Players are spawned at random points on the map and must hunt each other down while a barrier closes in, damaging those outside it. It&#x2019;s as straightforward as a battle royale can be, but there&#x2019;s one odd wrinkle: you can&#x2019;t damage people with your fists, so you&#x2019;d better get a weapon as quickly as you can. MODS PlayerUnknown&#x2019;s Battle Royale in Arma 2, Arma 3 Before PUBG, Brendan &#x201C;PlayerUnknown&#x201D; Greene created DayZ: Battle Royale, an offshoot of the original DayZ mod for Arma 2, inspired by the Japanese film. When players started leaving DayZ for the standalone Early Access version, Greene switched to developing <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=421900169\">Battle Royale in Arma 3</a>. Later, it was licensed to Daybreak for H1Z1 and became the foundation for King of the Kill. A lot of Battlegrounds&#x2019; features started in PlayerUnknown&#x2019;s Battle Royale, and Arma 3&#x2019;s realistic aesthetic isn&#x2019;t far of PUBG&#x2019;s. Rust: Battle Royale <a href=\"http://rustbattleroyale.com/\">Rust: Battle Royale</a> is an unofficial mode for Facepunch Studio&#x2019;s survival game, made by Intoxicated Gaming. Inspired by the Arma 3 Battle Royale mod, it combines the brutality of Rust&#x2014;you even begin naked&#x2014;with the race to be the final person left alive. All the survival and crafting elements have been torn out, with the focus being entirely on gearing up and murdering your fellow players in a map that becomes smaller and smaller as bombs start to fall. Garry&apos;s Mod Battle Royale Created last year, this <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=661587517&amp;searchtext=\">Garry&#x2019;s Mod game mode</a>, like so many in this list, owes its creation to the Arma 3 mod, being a lightweight recreation of it designed by IC4RO so they could play it with their friends. Since then, however, it&#x2019;s become popular, no doubt helped by the fact that Garry&#x2019;s Mod is considerably cheaper than Arma 3 or Battlegrounds.&#xA0; ",

        "contents": "Garry Newman of Facepunch Studios, developer of Rust, reported on Twitter today that the 329,970 copies of the Early Access survival game have been refunded on Steam. According to Newman (in another tweet), that comes to around 6% of all copies sold. (Extrapolating from that, it appears <a href=\"http://steamspy.com/app/252490\">Steamspy&apos;s estimation of 5,509,983 Rust owners</a> is pretty close to the mark.) In terms of dollars, those refunds total an eyebrow raising $4.3 million USD. It&apos;s probably not quite sensible to look at the $4.3 million as a straight-up loss of revenue. Since Steam began allowing refunds of games played for fewer than two hours, customers have presumably become much more cavalier about purchasing and trying games, knowing there&apos;s a safety net if they decide they don&apos;t want to keep them. I asked Newman via Twitter what the most common reason given for requesting a refund was, and he replied &quot;Not fun followed by bad performance - which is pretty fair I think.&quot; ",

        "contents": "The latest update to the multiplayer survival goat rodeo <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> makes what sounds like a number of fairly significant changes to gameplay, particularly regarding guns, which for better or worse are an important part of the game. Facepunch&apos;s Maurino Berry explained in <a href=\"http://rust.facepunch.com/blog/devblog-162/\">Devblog 162</a> that the changes to firearms&#x2014;three of them, really&#x2014;are meant to address complaints that the recoil in Rust is &quot;screwy and unfun,&quot; and collectively make the action &quot;feel a little bit more in line with traditional first-person shooters.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;First, you&apos;re going to notice less horizontal recoil so it&apos;ll be easier to maintain your target. Secondly, you&apos;re going to notice that, for rifles, the first shot is pretty much dead accurate and the longer you hold down the trigger the more inaccurate it gets by way of an increasing aimcone. This means you&apos;ll be able to tap at targets for high accuracy or you can risk spraying more rounds down range which are less likely to hit their targets,&quot; Berry wrote. &quot;Lastly, I&apos;ve implemented recoil compensation. This means if you&apos;re holding down the trigger and the weapon is riding up, as soon as you let go of the trigger it will correct back to the original aim position.&quot;&#xA0; The cost of weapons have been adjusted slightly as well: The Thompson now costs ten HQM (high quality metal) less to craft than prior to the update, while the pump shotgun and laser sight cost five HQM less. Shotgun accuracy is also going up a bit thanks to the discovery that accuracy &quot;cones&quot; were actually being calculated as accuracy &quot;pyramids.&quot; And if, for some reason, you don&apos;t like the new recoil compensation feature, it can be disabled by entering &quot;player.recoilcomp false&quot; at the console.&#xA0; Other changes in the update include the addition of drop boxes, the return of dynamic moon phases, and the start of a &quot;much-need overhaul&quot; of Hapis Island. A quick rundown of everything new and changed can be pumped directly into your eyeballs via the update video below. ",

        "contents": "Facepunch Studios boss Garry Newman has some advice for <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> players who have grown bored with the game: Stop playing it. He acknowledged that the sentiment may come across as dismissive, but said in a message <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/5i428j/we_need_to_talk_about_this_situation/\">on Reddit</a> that it&apos;s necessary to break the &quot;ping-pong loop&quot; that&apos;s holding the game back from full release.&#xA0; &quot;I&apos;m noticing a pattern, and we need to address it. It&apos;s something we need to get past as a community, not only because it&apos;s getting boring but because it has wider implications,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We&apos;re stuck in ping pong loop. We release an update, you love it for a month, you get bored, blame the system, bitch for a few months, then we release another update&#x2014;and the same thing happens.&quot;&#xA0; His concern is that the pattern will persist indefinitely, because the real problem isn&apos;t that the new systems are better than the old ones, but simply that they&apos;re &quot;fresher.&quot; But Facepunch obviously can&apos;t keep overhauling the game forever, and thus Newman suggests a clean break for those unhappy with Rust. But he also asked that people who do end up quitting, or who think his attitude is unfair, give thought to &quot;whether we have given you enough entertainment over the last three years to justify pocketing your $20&quot; before getting angry. &quot;If you&apos;re interested in the game, if you play regularly and still get enjoyment when you play&#x2014;we&apos;re definitely interested to hear what you think. We especially love hearing your stories, watching your videos, seeing your screenshots and paintings&#x2014;all things that this subreddit has been very low on,&quot; Newman wrote. &quot;If we want to leave Early Access then breaking this loop has to be part of that plan. We have a pretty good idea on how to push forward with Rust, but none of it is going to make the game more appealing to people that have spent their last 1,000 hours hating it.&quot;&#xA0; As silly as it sounds, it&apos;s actually very easy to find players with more than 1000 hours in Rust giving it negative reviews <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/\">on Steam</a>. Two of them are on the front page, along with a few 100-plus-hour negative reviews; one of them, with more than 1200 hours on record, came about at least in part in response to Newman&apos;s statement. It&apos;s an unfortunate reaction, but probably inevitable, too: Sooner or later, every game developer has to settle on what exactly they&apos;re trying to make, and no matter how good that final concept may be, somebody, somewhere, is going to be mad about it. &#xA0; ",

        "contents": "This past week's Rust update brought some big changes to the way the first-person survival game works, including the removal of the XP and levelling system. Developer Facepunch Studios detailed why players won't level up in Rust anymore, noting that it \"completely changed the feel of Rust as a sandbox.\" Facepunch's Maurino Berry explained how the game \"was no longer about new encounters and enjoying your time in the game world, but instead about how to level up as quickly as you can.\" This resulted in the game becoming boring once you had levelled to the max, making for an unsustainable gameplay model. \"New items we haven't even thought of yet would need to be hacked into certain levels, which would cause a never ending balance nightmare and item bloat (it was already ridiculous when you'd reach a level and have 12 things unlocked),\" Berry continued. \"Eventually we'd like to never have to wipe and just have decay and resource management take care of the server, XP was not compatible with this goal without all kinds of workarounds and hacks forced in like some sort of prestige system.\" Berry concluded with the fact that XP negated the \"'making lemonade out of lemons' feel\" that Rust excels at, where your loadout would be consisted of whatever you could find and use. Replacing XP is the component system, which makes everything craftable from the moment you start. This means no more locked items or blueprints. However, items beyond basics require the use of a component to craft, and these can only be discovered in the world components can't be crafted. Additionally, players will see the return of radiation, which has been remixed a bit. You can read more about the latest update on the Rust devblog <a href=\"https://playrust.com/devblog-134/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. One note that Berry makes is an issue where the game chugs and pauses periodically. He says that if players experience this, they should press F7 and send an error report to the developer, mentioning \"you're experiencing the same issue highlighted in the devblog.\" ",

        "contents": "I'm almost glad there's no first-person knocking animation in Early Access survival crafting game Rust if there were, I'd be sick of watching it by now and my virtual knuckles would be bloody and full of splinters. I've been knocking on player forts all night, dozens of them, in an attempt to go trick-or-treating for Halloween. It's not going well. It began well, though! The admin for the <a href=\"http://www.rustymoose.info/\">Rusty Moose</a> servers was kind enough to help me with a request: a way to spawn with a mask. Cognizant of the fact that I might die repeatedly, I didn't want to have to do any harvesting or crafting for my costume, so she was nice enough to place a few shacks around the servers, link me to the sleeping bags within, and fill a crate inside the shack with pumpkins. This meant I could spawn in the shacks, put a pumpkin on my head, and get right to work. Sure, I was completely naked otherwise, but a costume is a costume. Content warning: you can see my dong in the above image Time for trick-or-treating! Dressed as a nude man with a pumpkin on his head and nothing else on his anything, I leave the shack and head for the nearest visible fort, making almost fifteen feet before I encounter another player. This is a popular server without about 150 people on it, and not all of them ask questions first and open fire later. I'm dropped so quickly I almost don't realize what has happened, though luckily I got a replay the next time I spawn. And the next. And the next. At least I can see the inside of my mask each time I'm killed, which makes the adventure a bit more festive. I pick a different shack to spawn in, and finally get the chance to actually knock on a few doors. There's no answer on any of them, but all this running around lets me admire and critique some player forts. A common design theme seems to be <em>It's A Big Box</em>, but I also see a few <em>It's A Small Box</em>, several <em>It's a Box With Another Box On Top</em>, and more than one <em>It's Part of a Box</em>. Also, in keeping with election season: <em>It's A Wall.</em> At any rate, the amount of forts is impressive. The server was completely wiped not long ago, and I was a little worried there wouldn't be any forts at all. I was wrong: there are tons of them. Rust players certainly know how to build. They also know how to shoot you, stab you, and bludgeon you. It's a multi-talented community. I knock on some more doors, but no one answers. I run into a player, the first I've encountered who doesn't actually murder me, and we chat for a moment. A few minutes later another goes hopping by, his dong flapping in the breeze. Gunfire echoes in a nearby valley. I see a deer and a horse and a boar. I knock on more doors, even yelling \"Trick-or-treat!\" a few times. Still, no one answers. I run and knock on more doors. It begins to rain. A bald naked woman assaults me with an unlit torch, and chases me for a while before giving up. The complete lack of treats I've received means I'm beginning to starve, and soon, I'm dying from lack of food. Two heavily armed players run by, and one helpfully saves me from starvation by shooting me in the face. I hop onto the other Rusty Moose server hoping to find less bloodshed and more snacks. I visit more forts, including one that looks like two Box forts climbed into a teleporter together and were spliced together to form a BrundleBox. I see a few wooden skyscrapers, at least one Octagon, and a homeless shelter (I presume for players who haven't built their own Boxes yet.) Still, no one is answering when I knock or yell \"Trick-or-treat!\" I'm living longer there aren't as many hostiles here but that just means I begin starving again. At one point, I eat my pumpkin mask just to stay alive, but running around without it means I'm not a trick-or-treater, I'm just a naked idiot. I leap from a tall structure to kill myself, but wind up just severely wounding myself, and after I writhe around screaming for a while, I respawn, put on another pumpkin, and head out for one last pass. After a long night of running around with a torch knocking on another few dozen empty forts, I see a wonderful sight. It's a fort, and someone's home: I can see a figure on the roof, outlined against the sky. Excitedly, I rush up to the door and knock. There's no answer. I peer up at the roof, then knock again. Still nothing. I look up at the roof again, just in time to see the fort's owner jumping off it to the ground, where he beats me to death with a rock. Before he finishes me off, I hear him munching on something. In a night spent trick-or-treating in Rust, it's the closest I ever get to a treat. Happy Halloween. ",

        "contents": "SURVIVOR SERIES In survivor series we drop in on some of PC gaming's most promising survival games. Today, Holly Nielsen takes her finest killing rock into Rust. I woke up naked on an empty beach, with nothing but a rock in my hands and an unlit torch. Before I d even had a chance to stand up, someone had bashed my head in. Just before my assailant finished me off, two naked people approached, killed my attacker and stood staring at me. While I waited for them to attack me too they looked down, dropped a rock at my feet, and ran away into the distance. My first minute of <a href=\"https://playrust.com/\">Rust</a> was violent, brutal and oddly human. You ve probably heard of Rust as the game that people were outraged about as it randomly assigns the gender, race and sizing of your character. This online multiplayer survival game has built a huge following and has developed wonderfully bizarre communities. I ve heard stories of warring factions who meet in a neutral ground ruled by a character who roleplays as the Swedish Chef from The Muppets, and people who wake up only to find themselves in a prison built by another player. It s like a social experiment with added nudity. As with most survival games the formula of gather, build, die, repeat is found here. The difference that you start stark naked with only a rock creates an added vulnerability, and a feeling that you're trapped in the embryonic stages of technology. Resource gathering of course involves a lot of hitting trees and rocks and wandering about in search of food and materials. Unlike many of its contemporaries Rust's tree-chopping and rock-bashing has a sense of weight. This is a welcome change to the plethora of Minecraft-meets-DayZ clones on Steam, where gathering involves little more than pawing at various objects. By gathering resources, crafting objects and killing either your fellow humans or wild animals you gain experience points which can be spent on new items to craft. Eventually you ll advance from the Stone Age to automatic rifles. Progress is slow but satisfying. However, once you die you can wave goodbye to your inventory and progress. Unless you ve managed to build a storage, ideally behind locked doors and defences, your stash is either lost with you or looted by your fellow players. Death can come quickly from starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, falling, radiation or being attacked and it s surprisingly brutal when it happens. Your character screams and writhes in pain in prolonged death throes. While playing I have met almost just as many friendly players as those intent on murdering me, which can feel like a rarity in online survival games. While there s no singleplayer mode, there is still plenty of opportunity to focus on your own survival and settlement building. Of course there are still battle royale deathmatch servers if you fancy a spot of human-hunting. The lack of lumbering zombies (often a mainstay of survival games), puts the focus on human interaction and all the potential for friendship/betrayal that entails. Do you run and hide, or risk exposing yourself in the hope that other players will help you out? There s an eeriness to Rust's world. Sprinkled throughout the green and often pretty environment there s abandoned industrial buildings that house valuable materials. From time to time an airplane will fly overhead and drop supply crates. These crates become a focus point leading to interactions between players that often end in death. The mysterious planes and dilapidated buildings made me reflect on the chaos happening around and how bizarre the whole thing must look from above. Rust doesn't take itself too seriously. Before too long my character was running about the place with mismatching wellington boots and a pumpkin on his head. Thanks to a pleasant environment design and little humorous touches (like the pumpkin) Rust doesn t suffer from the brown overbearing barrenness that some other survival games do. The environment isn t perfect however. I have seen quite a few trees, rocks and dead bodies floating in mid-air, and textures pop in and out as you run about. Slow progression can be frustrating as you can find yourself starting again from scratch regularly. Early levelling up follows a similar line each time so you ll be repeating yourself a lot in the early stages of character growth. Fortunately the developer of Rust, Facepunch Studios, is regularly patching and updating the game. There are weekly developer blogs on the website that outline updates as well as what the team are currently working on. There are also regular blogs to keep players up to date on the rest off the very active Rust community. It feels like an actively growing product, rather than an unfinished game that the developer occasionally patches. For that reason, and the solid amount of interesting features already currently available in its alpha state it s one of the most fascinating online survival games available. <em>Disclosure: Facepunch writer Craig Pearson used to write for PCG up until about five years ago.</em> ",

        "contents": "As far as Early Access survival games go, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> is among the most loved. Although Garry Newman isn't currently working on the project, Facepunch continues to chip away at it under the supervision of lead developer Maurino Berry. One of Berry's recent additions <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust-introduces-xp-system/\">was XP</a>, which introduced a little bit of structure (ie, the permanent short term goal of <em>grinding</em>). Although the system was welcomed pre-launch, it appears to be conflicting with the studio's and the fanbase's longterm vision for the game. As spotted by <a href=\"http://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/rust-xp-system\">PCGamesN</a>, Berry wrote <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/51ti9w/official_bug_reporting_megathread_devblog_126/d7ev35o\">on reddit</a> recently that, in the future, Rust would not have XP at all. Fans on reddit and in the game's Steam review section have been vocal about how the system doesn't quite work, and Berry has recently offered his own thoughts. Basically, the system appears to mute the chaos that arises from Rust's previously more freeform and less quantitative sense of progress. \"As I ve said before, the XP system had huge praise until it was released, and then lots of people hated it,\" Berry <a href=\"https://playrust.com/devblog-123/\">wrote in August</a>. \"I m not deaf nor blind to this, and I m leaning towards the whole thing needing a rethink. \"In some ways the XP system is the antithesis of what Rust was all about: it forces players to do things in a certain order and takes away from the sandbox feeling of the game. We added this because people were bitching about how grindy hitting barrels and hoping for blueprints was, but I neglected to realize that the randomness could actually lead to some interesting situations and forced you to work with what you had.\" Berry's suggestion that XP will be removed entirely seems a little informal, and the studio might opt to revamp it instead, but the fact that it's a concern is good news for anyone whose recent falling out with the game is a result of the grind.

        "contents": "The latest Humble Bundle is all about surviving, which means if you're keen on strategy, resource management and harvesting lots of... stuff, then it may pique your interest. The base level games, available on a pay-what-you-want basis, include sci-fi turned based strategy <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/tharsis-review/\">Tharsis</a>, Early Access fantasy survival game Savage Lands, and the narrative-driven post-apocalypse of <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/kholat/\">Kholat</a>. While that's a lot to love there for some players, the next tier is arguably the real boon. If you pay more than the average donation (which is currently $5.11) you'll get Rust, Space Engineers and Shelter 2. In my humble opinion, $5.11 for Rust alone is a pretty good steal. The deal is <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/survive-this-bundle\">over here</a>, and elapses in a bit less than two weeks, so... no huge rush, I guess. ",

        "contents": "Marauding across post-apocalyptic lands and clubbing things with a rock just got a touch more structured. Early Access survival epic <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\" target=\"_blank\">Rust</a> has just been patched to include a wide-ranging XP system. From now on, you'll be awarded new-fangled 'experience points' for battering things with rocks, harvesting, fishing, feeding people, and so on. In a bid to reward cooperative play, you'll also receive XP for things others accomplish using your tools or materials the 'Ownership' system. \"An example is a Fish Trap,\" <a href=\"https://playrust.com/devblog-100/#more-7053\" target=\"_blank\">reads the dev blog</a>. \"If you make the trap but someone else uses it, you ll get XP. If you cook food and hand it to another player and they eat it, you ll it earn as well. If you harvest resources and someone else uses them to craft something like a hatchet, you ll earn XP.\" Interacting with others is the primary means of fostering multiple streams of XP. As you level up, you get a greater choice of items to spend your XP on, allowing you to carve a unique path through the game's upgrades rather than become a one-man building machine. I suppose it stands to reason that one person would have a hard time becoming both master fisherman and AK-47 designer. Dev Facepunch warns that the feature is incomplete, so expect ongoing balancing work. ",

Added benchmarks New eat/drink sounds New flamethrower sounds Fixed gradual ambience performance degradation bug Fixed coroutine leak in entity particle emission Optimized building block despawns some more Fixed another performance issue when looking at players Fixed tree culling performance issue caused by wind Optimized UI variable display code Adjusted grass LODing (less upscaling on lower LODs) Updated player preview idle Added wave displacement to water quality level 1 Limited shadow distance to 50 when shadow cascades are disabled Icesheet prefabs use LOD grid Fixed horizon sky / water blending Improved aerial perspective density computation Added shadowmode convar to adjust sun shadow casting Sun shadows disable completely when shadow distance is set to 0 Added additional procgen benchmarks Procgen benchmarks reset GC, LODs, grass, decor and tasks before every run Stripped legacy fog modes from shader compilation and scenes Fixed that the door animation was stopped one frame too early Fixed regression that sometimes skipped entity linking when building Fixed entities not sending slot updates when server side changes are made Made perf convar display async task queue when set to 6 Server restart command calls quit command after the timer reaches 0 Fixed missing ignite and extinguish icons on small furnace Slightly higher starting calories Fixed flames doing less damage to objects when sitting on stone/metal Map cost reduced to 1 paper Fixed water barrels not blocking building Fixed water bucket having drink as default option (impossible to deselect) Fixed being able to transfer water into an unheld bucket ",

This week, he visits the ultra-popular survival game.</em> As I died screaming between a wolf&#8217;s jaws, collapsing in the snow that dusts the top of the mountains while listening to it gnaw through virtual flesh, I had a realization: survival games are fun as long as they are about the threat of death. Death itself is underwhelming: a gateway to an ever-increasing set of chores and tasks that you must repeat in order to recover your lost progress. Inevitably, the process eventually repeats, and the to-do list gets longer and less fulfilling, which sounds a little bit like hell and a little bit like a parable about the human condition. <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/rust/\">Rust</a> , the multiplayer survival game from Facepunch Studios, seems comfortable with both analogies. &#8230; ",

NPC scientists are in the last category, I'm afraid, but if we all poke Facepunch with a big stick until they agree to include them, I reckon they will definitely include them. Here's how NPC scientists will work, when Facepunch relent and add them to their game: \"I want these guys to have a weird, unsettling feeling,\" says Facepunch's Paul Bradley. \"I felt like you could capture this by hiding their faces completely behind dirty face masks. I also think it would be cool if they somewhat ignored the player as they went about the island conducting their research, only really acknowledging you if you got too close and threatened them. It would be cool if you could hear them communicating to each other with muffled, distorted voices so you can t really understand what they re saying. Just to add to the creepy factor.\" The rest of the stuff in the devblog is less exciting, but there are few gratuitous shots of digital&nbsp;bums and willies, if you're interested. Also some lovely sky textures, plus work on dungeons continues apace. (Thanks,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/11/27/rust-scientist-npc/\" target=\"_blank\">RPS</a>!) ",

        "contents": "Head over to the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> store page <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/252490/\">on Steam</a> and you'll notice a new option offering \"Items available for this game,\" including clothing and firearms, that can be purchased for real money. It's the first (and, as far as I know, only) implementation of \"Item Stores,\" a function introduced in the latest update to Steam that enables developers and community creators to sell in-game items directly to players. The Rust Item Store exists, and will continue to exist, alongside the <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=753&amp;category_753_Game=tag_app_252490\">Community Market</a>, and pricing will often be different. The Red Shine Pistol on the Rust Item Store, for instance, goes for around $3, but costs just under $5 on the Community Market; the Forest Camo T-shirt, on the other hand, costs the same $3 on the Item Store but can be had on the Market for 5 <em>cents</em>. That might sound a bit sketchy, but product descriptions on the Item Store very visibly include the Community Market pricing as well. \"Part of the reason for having the market prices next to the listings is to make it clear to people if the price is lower somewhere else. Items will come and go from the item store, but they'll be available on the market as long as people are selling them,\" Facepunch Studios mastermind Garry Newman explained. And while the Rust Item Store currently features studio-made items \"as a test for the system,\" it's mainly in place for community-created items. Newman acknowledged that the Item Store bears some surface similarities to the paid mods fiasco that <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-has-removed-paid-mods-functionality-from-steam-workshop/\">caused so much upset</a> earlier this year, but noted that the products it sells are strictly cosmetic, and they're also given to players&nbsp;through random, timed drops in the game, meaning that nobody will be excluded. \"I think the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-allows-mod-makers-to-sell-their-creations-on-steam/\">launch on Skyrim</a> gave a really negative vision of what the future looked like. Instead of showing how it would lead to better, more supported mods, it showed how you were going to be asked to pay for the shit you were getting for free yesterday,\" he said. \"Pretty much all the modders I've spoken to would at least like the choice to sell their mods. Personally I think they deserve to be able to make that choice themselves. It's not a choice that should be made by us, or Valve or by the neckbeards on Reddit.\" He expanded upon that thought in a post on his <a href=\"http://garry.tv/2015/11/04/microtransactions/\">personal blog</a>, in which he said that Valve's approach is good for everyone, including people who can't, or don't want to, spend money on this stuff. \"They hate traditional microtransactions because it s a paywall. But on Steam they play the game and get random drop items, and can then sell and trade those items on the marketplace,\" he wrote. \"It s not unfeasible that a player will make more money selling items than the game itself cost.\" Newman said the backend for Item Stores has actually existed for some time now, and that as far as he knows it's available to any developer who wants to use it. \"Steam doesn't really partition features off for certain people, everything they add is there to be used by all developers,\" he said. \"We're just agile enough to have gotten there first.\" I imagine it won't be the last.

If a griefer wants to target you&nbsp;they can tune into your stream, enter your server and troll you relentlessly with the advantage of knowing your every move.&nbsp; Facepunch has noticed this phenomenon, and patched in a tool to stop it from happening. As part of a major patch which rolled out late last week, Streaming Mode is an attempt to curb the griefing. \"First of all it tries to hide all server names, so if you re streaming and you accidentally press escape, your audience won t see the server name,\" the Facepunch spokesperson wrote on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://playrust.com/devblog-78/\">official Rust website</a>. \"Secondly, it changes everyone s name to something random. The names are based on their steamid, so the same guys will always have the same names. You ll recognise your friends because they will always have the same random name.\" That's not all the patch introduces:&nbsp;there s a new NPC attack chopper, \"holosights for weapons, new perimeter fence gates, an engine update, and loads more.\" Go forth and survive in peace.

Look at these lovely new&nbsp;balaclavas, for example. They look like the heads of&nbsp;hollowed-out Sackboys. Rust is also (probably) getting bandanas and a&nbsp;quiver, along with&nbsp;some funky makeshift backpacks. On the fixes side of things, we can expect a revised hitbox system that will stop players from shielding bullets with their hands, the return of hit indicator sounds and visual effects, loot table changes, muzzle flashes and, oooh, lots more. At the end of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://playrust.com/devblog-73/\" target=\"_blank\">the post</a>, there's also a changelog for the most recent update&mdash;I'll paste that below. * Lots of tweaks to weapon deploy/swing/reload sounds; * Rocket launcher volume fixes; * Hitmarker sound tweaks; * Gunshots and bullet impacts can be heard from further away; * Large deployables new foundations; * New room in Satellite Dish monument; * Linux fix; * Added improvised balaclava; * Added boonie hat; * Vagabond Jacket is less rare; * Avoided Unity crash when starting with headphones plugged in; * Fixed certain situations that could cause rubberbanding; * Optimized server game saving; * Airdrop event now pauses auto-saving; * Fixed framerate spikes the first time an effect is triggered; * Optimized ragdoll initialization; * Made protocol mismatch message more descriptive; * Headlook direction is now networked; * Added mesh batching to compound walls and barricades; * Improved server backup system; * Reduced rain probability some more; * Fixed duplicate barrels and crates after server restart; * Drowning water level now matches underwater camera effects; * Tweaked water drop overlay when swimming; * Fixed console UI not refreshing when entering console commands that don t reply with anything; * Added hit notification with convar controls; * Slightly increased depsawn times for bodies and dropped items; * Dropped items despawn slower if they are more rare; * Research Table success chance rounds down to match UI; * Updated muzzle flashes to be non blocking; * Updated hitbox damage scales; * Wood armor is no longer default; * Bone armor is no longer default; * Viewmodels have less sway when aiming down the sights; * Loot table balance for BP fragment system; ",

For now, all admins will be switched to the female model to help with testing, and once the models are fully implemented, a player's sex, like his or her race, will be assigned at random. \"We still have some stuff to work out, like making alternate clothing models for her, but if you re an admin on a server you ll be the female model,\" Newman wrote in the latest devblog. \"To clear up some confusion, when we it does go live you won t get a choice of whether you re female or male. We re not 'taking the choice away' from you. You never had a choice. A man s voice coming out of a woman s body is no more weird than an 8 year-old boy s voice coming out of a man s body.\" Newman confirmed in email that all admins will be set to female automatically, although \"that just for testing right now.\" And yes, like other physical characteristics, sex&nbsp;will be assigned to specific Steam IDs, and cannot be changed. The devlog also answers questions about the game's integration of Steam inventory, because, Newman said, \"I know this shit makes people nervous.\" Items being added to the inventory are purely cosmetic, and more significantly, Facepunch isn't charging for them; instead, they'll be awarded based on playtime. There are currently no plans to sell blueprints, which he said the studio sees as \"more like a card collecting game where the cards are something you actually want,\" but it could happen in the future. \"The thing I guess to understand is that Rust is STILL in Early Access and we need to take advantage of that fact,\" he wrote. \"This is the time for experimentation&mdash;because once it s not in early access we won t be able to do these kinds of game changing things&mdash;and we ll wish we had.\" Other changes to the game include the addition of Bone and Wood armor, changes to player movement and \"Head Freelook,\" various visual improvements, and quite a bit more. By all appearances, it's been a busy week. Full details are up at <a href=\"http://playrust.com/devblog-69/\">PlayRust.com</a>. ",

In March, when Rust <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust-update-assigns-skin-color-and-face-to-players/\">began randomly selecting players skin color</a> for them, an attribute permanently bound to your character, it sparked <a href=\"http://steamed.kotaku.com/rust-chooses-players-race-for-them-things-get-messy-1693426299\">a range of interesting reactions</a>, from anger and delight to confusion. Tomorrow, as part of Rust s usual Thursday update, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/your-rust-dong-size-is-determined-by-your-steam-id/\">penis size</a> will become a variable element of your character. And surprisingly, Facepunch say that the feature wasn t a deliberate addition at first, but something that emerged as part of the package of algorithms that drive random generation of stuff like head size and jaw definition. The dick thing wasn t really planned, it just so happens that it has a separate bone there for the censorship cube that we can scale independently, Facepunch founder Garry Newman told <a href=\"http://steamed.kotaku.com/rust-randomizes-penis-length-players-compare-sizes-1713173721\">Kotaku</a>. But the decision to keep it in the game was deliberate. We're hoping like hell for more dick jokes. We might all range from 20-40 years old at Facepunch, but we're all eight years old at heart., says Newman. I heard SteamDB is adding a way to track your RDS (Rust Dick Size). Then again, Newman doesn t expect the Rust community to react dramatically to the change, partly because the maximum size of a character s junk is limited by the fixed size of Rust s censorship box. You've really got to be lining players up and comparing them to see any real change, says Newman. The expected range of sizes is small, but players who have bigger penises will actually get the short end of the stick; taking a crotch shot in Rust deals more damage than a hit to some other areas of the body. All the hitboxes are scaled. People with a bigger dick get a bigger dick hitbox, people with a bigger head get a bigger head hitbox, says Newman. To Newman, the broader point of randomizing something like penis size is that there s value in putting players in a position to play with what they re given. We did consider a player customization system, says Newman. We looked a bunch of them, we watched them on YouTube. In some cases people were spending a couple of hours designing their character. The character design part of the game had more work put into it than the game itself. And these were games where what you looked like was completely irrelevant, where it was obviously just on some list that a publisher handed a developer. So we thought fuck all that. Fuck spending months making a character designer, lets make the game about the game. Then the more we started thinking in that direction the more we liked it. Assigning based on steamid means that everything we add gets evenly spread across the playerbase. We don't end up with 90 percent male white guys. We end up with a full spectrum. Players have to live with and accept who they are. They are recognizable, so more gameplay mechanics emerge. The long term goal in the back of our heads is to hide player names and have them only recognisable by familiarity. I think we are approaching that. \"Players have to live with and accept who they are. They are recognizable, so more gameplay mechanics emerge.\" Facepunch is the process of finishing a female player model to Rust. The body will vary, like the males, but we're not sure to what level. We're trying not to sexualize the nudity in Rust, says Newman. That's easy for the male model because there's nothing sexy about a limp penis, in fact it's probably got an inverse sexual properly. With boobs that's different maybe. ",

        "contents": "In many ways, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> has always been something of a digital social experiment: What happens when people are thrown together in a primitive, isolated environment, with no rules beyond \"survive?\" (Answer: It's Lord of the Flies, every single time.) Back in March, the experiment got a little deeper (and the uproar, a little louder) when the game was <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust-update-assigns-skin-color-and-face-to-players/\">updated</a> to arbitrarily assign unchangeable faces and skin tones to players, and now an even more sensitive bit of anatomy has been adjusted in a manner that will likely please some players more than others. The hot tip came from <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/3amg9b/penis_size_determined_by_steam_id/cse0108\">Reddit</a>, of course, (via <a href=\"http://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/rust-s-penis-sizes-are-based-on-your-steamid\">PCGamesN</a>), in the form of a <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/June/21/2015-06-21_18-08-58.mp4\">video</a> showing the effects of different Steam IDs on penis size. The actual workings of the system remain a closely-guarded mystery, but Rust creator Garry Newman confirmed that the report is accurate. \"Like tallness, face, head size, jaw definition, race, and limb size, penises are also randomized,\" he said. And, like those other features, it's tied to your Steam ID and cannot be changed; if you come up short, so to speak, you're just going to have to deal with it. Maybe buy a big pickup truck or something. Despite the many variations in \"features,\" everyone in Rust shares one common attribute: They're all dudes. That may change in the not-too-distant future, however, as Facepunch revealed in its latest <a href=\"http://playrust.com/devblog-65/\">blog post</a> that it has begun the process of adding a female model to the game. But don't get too wound up over the prospect of being trapped on an island filled with naked swimsuit models. \"We really don t want to make the female model unrealistic in the sense of her being aesthetically idealized,\" Tom&mdash;presumably Facepunch artist Thomas Butters&mdash;wrote. \"In the same way that our male models aren t perfect specimens of the male body, neither should the female be. No huge boobs nor four-inch waists here.\" That's as it should be, and as it has to be, really. Unlike the ESRB, I don't have a problem with nudity in videogames, but a game filled with male schlubs and female supermodels would look pretty weird. Butters added that in-game testing of the female model could begin as soon as next week. ",

No, a new <a href=\"http://www.facepunchstudios.com/2015/04/10/arcade-devblog-12/\">dev blog post</a> shows it&#8217;s still coming along nicely.

The initial free versions of both open-world survive &#8216;em ups were scrappy things, quickly growing and tossing features onto foundations that, it turned out, weren&#8217;t quite able to support them. Starting over from scratch, both have moved more cautiously through Early Access, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed seeing how they grow at this slower pace.

You can now remove an unlocked lock through it’s option menu and it’ll appear in your inventory, leaving the door available for a new lock to be placed. Building Skins Garry Newman Vince has really worked his bollocks off on the buildings skins this week. He's set up a system, where the ground accumulates dirt around the edges.

We might not see these performance benefits just yet though. I've made a few changes on my own branch to handle the increased skin component count better, and that isn't on the main branch yet. So reserve judgement until next week. Skin Polish Garry Newman Tom has been fixing and polishing off the skins that were rushed in last week. There's still only 2 skins and 2 meshes (which give us the 4 faces below), but they've been fixed up and polished. This has put Tom in a better position to make more skins/heads in the future. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/19/2015-03-19_16-32-41.png http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/19/2015-03-19_16-33-16.png http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/19/2015-03-19_16-33-04.png http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/19/2015-03-19_16-32-52.png Auto Sprint Maurino Berry One thing I’ve noticed while playing rust is that my left pinky gets awfully sore from sprinting all the time running long distances. I added a small feature in to combat this and here’s how it works: If you are sprinting for more than 3 seconds, feel free to let go of the sprint key! Your character will continue to run as long as you’re holding the forward key. Any other movement key presses, or releasing W will stop disengage it. I think everyone will find it intuitive and most people won’t even know it’s there, and it will save us all from early onset arthritis! Damage Flinching Maurino Berry Minh has been working on adding some new gestures to players and animals, you’ll notice when someone or something takes damage they’ll perform a pain flinch based on where they were hit, not all the animals are done but this adds an extra level of visual feedback that was missing from the game. Ambient sound is back Garry Newman Alex has re-written a lot of the underlying sound system, which probably means that the freeze when playing ambient sounds is fixed. We're assuming because we don't know for sure, but we haven't experienced any. Let us know if we're wrong! Legacy Update Garry Newman Legacy was also updated today. Nothing to get excited about. We've just added Unity Analytics to it so we can have a definitive answer when making decisions based on Legacy player counts. There's also a bit of a fake player count fix in there too - which makes it harder for servers to fake the player counts. The Rest Added heat wave effect to furnaces and campfires Increased visibility of water footsteps Updated SSAO to actually be visible, turn it off tho cuz it's slow You get 2 arrows per crafting session, and they are cheaper 2 Shotgun Shells per crafting session Made some clothes model combinations more compatible Fixed item deletion when picking up an item when you have a full inventory Updated a bunch more icons PVT enabled by default, setting saved Summary Garry Newman We made a decision this week. We've been trying to get to baseline, building a foundation, get shit stable. We decided that although it's not perfect and exactly where we're at, it's time to start pushing forward with adding features. Balance, performance and stability is going to obviously be affected by these new features so probably doesn't make much sense to hold off on new features until we get these things perfect. I hope that's welcome news to everyone. It means that we'll have weeks where the update is quite lean, as sprints go long and take a couple of weeks to complete. So next week you'll start to see that coming through in a minor way, and over the next few months you should start seeing it coming through in more major gameplay ways. Also starting next week I'm not going to be writing these devblogs myself. The bus factor is too low right now as we saw last week, if I'm not around they can't get posted. So I'm going to encourage people to post the stuff they've done themselves and get Buck to curate and post these blogs.",

We've only done walls so far, but we're working through the entire set. What this means is that we're using a different rendering mesh for models that are far away, which is lower resolution - which obviously doesn't take so much power to render. Because obviously it's a waste of time rendering a highish poly model for something that will only be about 6 pixels tall on the screen. We've also done a lot of work on serverside performance. The AI now thinks at a fixed rate. Previously it tried to think every frame. Race & Face Everyone now has a pseudo unique skin tone and face. Just like in real life, you are who you are - you can't change your skin colour or your face. It's actually tied to your steamid. Right now your avatar is randomised via three things. Skin colour, head mesh and head material. We only have 2 face textures and 2 face materials, which means there's 4 possible combinations. We will be adding more of these later on (at which point your face will probably change). There's a lot of skin colours in the world, and it's really easy to appear racially insensitive when doing this. This is compounded by the fact that everyone is really used to seeing this guy as a white guy, so when you see him as a black guy it feels like he's just \"blacked up\". So we're spending a lot of time trying to lessen that effect. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/13/2015-03-13_15-08-59.png http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/13/2015-03-13_15-09-52.png There's still work to be done, so consider this just the boilerplate of an idea for now. It's quite pleasing to see different races working together in game, and makes you realise how arbitrary race is. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/13/2015-03-13_15-05-47.jpg Building Enhancements Vince has been doing a lot of work on the building pieces, having fun with the conditional models to make things appear more natural. I've changed the conditional model system so it only runs on model that are close to the player, instead of like previously where it'd be running the logic on buildings that were a mile away, and not prioritising nearby buildings at all. This meant that more often than not you were never actually seeing the conditional models. Placement of the foundation relative to the ground is now configurable, and foundation stairs work a lot more naturally. I had to put a bunch of new logic in for the stairs placement so that they'd go up or down depending on which side of the placement you are. If you're standing on a foundation looking out, it'll try to place upwards, if you're on the outside it will place them downwards. A bit of work was done to make the guide more reliable, to fix problems like when it turns red and floats towards the player, or staying attached even when you've walked quite far away. The building sidewards trick that people were using to build skybridges was also fixed. Roof blocks don't require to be placed on a floor anymore, you can just attach them to a wall. Vince has made the roof block even more awesome by giving it a vaulted ceiling. Ragdoll Fixes Ragdolls weren't copying their bones from their parent. This was making stuff look really laggy as when the ragdoll spawned the player/npc would still be visible, and the ragdoll would spawn in their default stance. This is fixed now so things look a bit more natural. Fog Changes We changed how fog worked to give a better sense of distance. Previously the dog was only showing up in the far distance.. which looked great in certain situations but it meant that it was hard to get a sense of distance. You'd be looking at some point on the landscape that you thought was 50 meters away, then see a tree near by that revealed it was 500 meters away. Hopefully the fog changes will make that less common. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/13/2015-03-13_14-49-42.png http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/13/2015-03-13_14-49-56.png Stone Pickaxe Up until now you had to harvest Ore with your rock until you got lucky in a radtown and found a salvaged tool.

We're trying to get a repro together to send to Unity. We also started an issue list over at github.

We've only done walls so far, but we're working through the entire set. What this means is that we're using a different rendering mesh for models that are far away, which is lower resolution - which obviously doesn't take so much power to render. Because obviously it's a waste of time rendering a highish poly model for something that will only be about 6 pixels tall on the screen. We've also done a lot of work on serverside performance. The AI now thinks at a fixed rate. Previously it tried to think every frame. Race & Face Everyone now has a pseudo unique skin tone and face. Just like in real life, you are who you are - you can't change your skin colour or your face. It's actually tied to your steamid. Right now your avatar is randomised via three things. Skin colour, head mesh and head material. We only have 2 face textures and 2 face materials, which means there's 4 possible combinations. We will be adding more of these later on (at which point your face will probably change).

Most of those should be fixed now, though improving the road network generation is still an ongoing process. We also added an initial version of bridges which are very much still a work in progress but really help keep landmarks connected. With roads doing the right thing for the most part we felt experimental and added a proof of concept for rivers. On the one hand rivers are great because everyone wants them and they do a big deal to make landscapes look unique. On the other hand rivers are horrible because they come with all sorts of issues that have to be addressed with workarounds that are more or less ugly. They cause Z-fighting between the river mesh and the terrain mesh, fuck around when the terrain mesh changes LODs and make checks for whether or not something is underwater an order of magnitude more complex. Nonetheless we decided to run with it and added rivers to the procedural maps. There’s bound to be issues with this first iteration - for one you’re not getting wet when crossing rivers - but we’ll solve those as we go along. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/05/2015-03-05_20-03-42.jpg A nice side effect of having proper rivers that flow down slopes is that they allowed us to remove a lot of the water at zero level which was previously supposed to kind of look like rivers but really didn’t. This allows for much more terrain elevation and gives us much more freedom when designing the procedural generation. One example of this is a huge increase in the number of mountain lines, simply because we have much more space available for them. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/05/2015-03-05_20-45-48.jpg The new terrain shape also gives us a lot more freedom when texturing the terrain. Biomes now depend on both the latitude (how far north or south a position is) as well as the altitude (how high a position is), leading to much more detail and variety overall. Further changes include a new warehouse landmark, bigger and more condensed rock clusters, improved sand dunes, nicer mountaintops, smoother texture blending and many more I’ve probably forgotten. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/05/2015-03-05_20-46-26.png Packet Errors When we first moved to Raknet were getting occasional problems with entities being missing on the client. The server was sending them but they weren't showing up. Investigation found that the entities weren't reaching the client - but we had a lot of invalid packets. I added a checksum to the entity networking process. Players that were missing entities got kicked. The assumption was that these were network issues, maybe people were on a shit internet connection. But then a lot of people started getting kicked. And it was the same people. The main reason for moving to Raknet was that it's a tried and tested platform, so any bugs were going to be in my code. So I spent hours ripping my code to bits, putting it back together in a different order. No change. So maybe it's some other code overwriting the memory that contains the packets, so I disabled any other native code we had running which could be a problem. No change. So maybe it's some compiler flag in our native dll, maybe it's a raknet define, maybe we're sending too much data and raknet isn't tested for it. All no change. After reading through lots of feedback from you guys (thanks), I spotted a pattern. It was happening when the packet was larger than the MTU (the maximum size of information that fits in a single packet), so it was only happening when the packet had to be split. I set up a bunch of logging which confirmed it. Some packets were split and put back together again, and the one that errored out was put back together but we'd received the last peice first. But surely raknet would handle that right? Surely it would put shit back together in the right order? Nope. We've had no more issues with the dev servers since I applied a fix to this, but I'll be keeping my eyes open. Sound Updates Alex Rehberg We’ve tweaked volume levels and finished moving everything over to the new sound system, which gives us a lot more control over how things are played back. We’ve started working on filtering sounds as they move farther away from the camera so that distant gunshots and explosions actually sound different. Moving underwater will also play splashing sounds and muffle the rest of the audio now. You are already connected There was a network issue where if you were kicked from a server you weren't actually removed. This meant you couldn't rejoin the server because it thought you were already on there.. and the player count didn't go down. Lerp Bug I dropped the ball. If you thought the last version was laggy it was probably because of this. I wasn't converting ping from seconds to milliseconds when working out the lerp. Luckily it was clamped, but you would have noticed that player movements were lagging about half a second behind where they really were (instead of pingtime). Thanks to bilford for pointing this out. Animal Attacks It should be more obvious when you're being attacked by a wolf now because it'll show the damage indicators on the screen indicating the direction. Dying is still something that sucks right now. Flashing to the \"you're dead\" screen isn't ideal, hopefully that'll be made better next week. Reinforced Grade Vince has finished off the reinforced building grade. The idea here is that the reinforced grade is the top tier, and combines the properties of wood, stone and metal. We want to get into a position where wood, stone and metal aren't chosen linearly, but they're chosen for their specific properties, but choosing reinforced brings the best of all those properties. It's going to take some time to jiggle that plan out, but that's what we're heading for. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/March/05/2015-03-05_20-13-31.jpg Exploits The gamma exploit is a long standing problem, and not one that is really easily fixed. We're testing something out that makes it a lot more useless. When something gets really dark now we just cut the colour off and draw it black. We lose a bit of image fidelity here, but it means that everyone is on the same level - and you don't have to feel to play the game all washed out just because everyone else is. Wipe Because of the big terrain changes this update requires a wipe. I'm guessing about half of you love wipes, and about half of you hate them. It's something that is required quite regularly at this stage of development but we're trying to keep it to an absolute minimum. Only the map needs to wipe - you will keep your blueprints.

We've talked ourselves out of it and talked ourselves back into it. Our primary problem with this solution was that we didn't like that people would be killing themselves to spawn near a friend. Which probably seems like a silly thing to worry about. So now I'm pulling the trigger. The idea is as simple as it could be. You hold E on a sleeping bag that you own, select assign to friend - then search for your friend's name and click on it. Your friend now owns this sleeping bag and can spawn at it. The player list is collected from players on the server and from your friends list. There will obviously be some issues with this. Maybe I will spend a buttload of resources to full your screen with sleeping bags calling you a bitch. Maybe I will make a sleeping bag for everyone on the server to fool them into spawning into my jail. I don't think the effects of these things are too devastating right now, so we're going to handle them as they become issues, instead of removing opportunities for emergent gameplay. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/26/2015-02-26_19-55-21.png http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/26/2015-02-26_19-54-51.jpg No More Demolishing Demolishing isn't used properly and mostly isn't needed, that's our conclusion. When you break into someone's base and you find their cupboard we don't think you should be able to pull out a hammer and demolish walls and doors to find secret rooms. You shouldn't be able to remove the entire building in a couple of minutes. You shouldn't be able to place a cupboard next to someone who doesn't have one, and demolish their base. That seems like common sense game design. There is one legit reason to use demolish. You are remodelling your base. It seems to us that this is something worth sacrificing, worth making people think around. Maybe we'll add further tools in the future to make remodelling easier, but we need to see how this changes gameplay before making those kind of decisions. The benefits of removing demolish are obvious. Penetrating a single wall and getting access to your cupboard doesn't give them access to your whole house. You can have multiple chambered safe rooms that take time for them to break into. Your house is probably still going to be there when you log in, even if you have been raided.

Well, we're changing it to Thursdays, alongside the devblog. The problem with Friday updates is that we lose our weekends because we're fixing bugs.. and in turn that ruins your weekends of playing Rust because bugs go unfixed, or we patch while you're playing - restarting servers and in the worst cases wiping. The problem with Monday updates is that we tell you what's in it on Friday. If there's going to be a wipe then playing over the weekend feels like a waste of time - because all your progress is gone on Monday. And no-one really wants to jump on the dev branch because the dev servers are unstable as we need to wipe a lot when testing. So it's good for no-one. So we're trying Thursday. Close enough to the weekend to give everyone something fresh, far enough away that we can patch any game breakers. We're moving the devblog here too - because that just makes good sense. Bootstap Error A lot of users were getting a \"bootstrap error\" where the game wouldn't load, it'd just sit at the bootstrapping screen. This was something blowing up in Unity Analytics. I've put a try catch around it, so we should be protected from that now. Animal Hide Clothing Xavier's animal hide clothing has made it in. We have boots, a vest, pants and a poncho. There's some incompatibilities with the poncho and the vest when wearing them together (terrible zfighting) - but I've nudged xavier about it and hopefully something can be done. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/19/2015-02-19_15-42-24.jpg http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/19/2015-02-19_15-45-56.jpg Footsteps Alex has been playing with the footsteps. He's replaced all the sounds, and added a bunch of variations for running and crouching. He's also some a lot of tweaking to avoid playing the sounds when they shouldn't be played. I'm sure a lot of people will be glad to hear that footsteps created by the local player are quieter - and are played in 2D so it doesn't sound like someone is running around you in circles. Metal Tier Vince has done an awesome job on the metal tier. The price and health of all of the blocks have all been balanced to suit the new tier.. and blocks aren't all wood anymore - when you hit a metal block you'll get sparks, when you hit a stone block you'll get dust - just like you'd expect. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/19/2015-02-19_16-08-01.jpg Raknet We've changed the networking system to use Raknet. This is likely to have fixed a bunch of networking issues people were having, and it's even more likely to have created some new ones. Raknet is a really common networking library which was bought by Oculus and made open source. The main difference between it and Lidgren (which we were previously using) is that Raknet is coded in C++, whereas Lidgren is coded in C#. Some people will suggest that this should give us a massive performance boost, but I don't really agree with that, but it definitely shouldn't be slower. But we might see other benefits in terms of garbage collection. Raknet is a tried and tested solution so if something is fucking up then we know it's our fault and it's fixable. That isn't something we had with Lidgren. This has also been a good chance to clean the networking system up in general. We had a few different functions to do the same thing, and some systems that were seriously under-used. Those have all been cleaned up now. Please let us know if this made things worse or better for you! Anti-Cheat EAC have been patching in the background. We were seeing problems with an error about SP2, that's fixed. You should also be able to play on Windows 10 now. It's probably a good time to explain why we have these EAC guys working at this instead of doing it ourselves. We didn't get into game development to fight these battles. Having a bunch of guys who specialise in this kind of stuff means we can concentrate on game development. Which is where we should be focusing all of our attention. And so far it's working. There are hacks for Rust - there always are going to be. But there are a lot less hacks for the current version than there were for Legacy. Something I've been considering lately. There are situations where someone will find an exploit, or a way around EAC, and they'll keep it a secret. Would it be a good idea to start a kind of reward system - where people revealing ways around our anti-cheat solutions would get a cash reward for reporting unreported exploits? Melee Raiding Balancing Internally we've been looking at how we can better balance the melee vs buildings stuff. When we're tweaking these values it can be hard to comprehend just what effect they will have. So we've been creating some in-editor tools to help us preview exactly what's happening. This has lead to a bunch of balances on the melee weapons. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/19/2015-02-19_17-17-18.png I appreciate this is data that the community would like to get their hands on - and there's pros and cons to that. Ultimately the data will be extracted some way or another, and having a bunch of eyes on it guarantees that there's less fuckups. But at the same time it takes some of the mystery away from the game, and any change we make is immediately flagged up and reviled against. Ultimately the pros overpower the cons - so once we have a way of generating it we'll find a way of making it available, and maybe even tweakable by server owners. Metabolism The metabolism hasn't been working for a while. This means you haven't died of hunger for a long while. It's enabled again now, so you can die of starvation and thirst. The rules are very simple right now. If you have lower than 20 calories or 20 thirst you'll lose health. If you have over 200 calories or thirst you will gain health. Calories and thirst drop 0.5 a minute. So if you have 80 calories right now, you have about two hours (real world time) to eat before you start losing health. The calories/health part of the metabolism doesn't take into account movement (heartrate) or heat or anything like that right now. This is on purpose to see how we feel about the rates before adding other factors. Localized Damage A while back we had a system where if you shot someone in the head it'd do more damage than if you shot them in the toe. Then some internal refactoring happened and it didn't get re-implemented. Now it's reimplemented. And it's more accurate than it used to be. You can shoot people in the thumbs. Known Issues Balance is going to be an issue for a while. We're still shifting values around and seeing what works. As time goes on this will get more granular and less noticeable until we settle. The upgrade text on the doors is wrong. Everything Else Fixed black water on lowest settings Timed explosives do a lot more damage Fixed admins not being admins in some aspects Arrows move faster, hurt buildings a lot less Updated bootstrap screen Wooden door key can be burnt in fire/furnace Bullets are affected by drag and can ricochet Bullet damage is based on velocity Summary Because of the update date change it's been a short week (2 days?) since the last update. Luckily we had a bunch of stuff queue'd up and ready to go. I'm expecting to be doing a lot of debugging over the next few days, just due to the raknet move. But hopefully next week will bring the repair bench and some more stuff from our baseline priority list.",

You can walk on them. This is still in the programmer-art stage, but since it's got to work in millions of different procedurally generated maps we thought it was best to get it in and find any problems as soon as possible. http://files.facepunch.com/andre/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-06%20at%2020.12.18.png Reloading I started making a crazy reload system. Holding R bought up a reload menu, showing your weapon and all the types of ammo that could fit in it. Left clicking an ammo pile would add one of that type to your gun, right clicking would fill it with that type. This meant that you could have more granular control over filling your weapon, and when we have different ammo types you could alternate them in your clip. Then we realised that it was all a big load of shit, and no-one would ever really want to do any of that. So I just changed it to be normal reloading. Goosey had already made reload animations for everything - so it's already cool as fuck. Item System A while back we thought.. wouldn't it be cool if all our items were on a website, so we could all edit them easier, and even people who aren't programmers and don't have Unity could edit them and fill stuff out. And then maybe our artists could upload models and materials, and then it would all be downloaded in the game and just work. Then eventually we could open it up to the public so anyone could make new items, and people could vote on the items and we'd put the best ones in game. We fell into the \"premature generalization\" problem here. We were making a system before we knew completely what it was, how it would be used, how it could be used. The items are defined in Unity now. This means that when we want to add a new item we just create a copy of the existing item, change a few text entries and it's done. In the old system we'd have to go to the site, create a new item, fill shit out, go to the game, download the item definition, then if something was wrong, repeat. There's a bunch of reasons why it's better now, but they're reasons only we care about. For you it means that I spent 2 days making us more agile. Compile Issues We were fighting compile issues for a few days. This meant that the dev server were mostly inaccessible during this time. The problem it turned out was that we had too much stuff. The resources file in the Unity build had a 2Gb limit, and we were going over that, which resulted in a cryptic error. The hacky solution, it turned out, was to make a scene that had a reference to all the textures, and a scene that had a reference to all the sounds. This made the resources.asset a lot smaller because it didn't contain any of those. Anti-Cheat Shortly after the patch on Monday EAC enabled the game file hashing stuff, which successfully stopped the resource editing stuff that was going on. If you were using this cheat you probably need to verify your game's content to re-download the non-hacked version of the files, so it will let you play again. At the moment Windows 10 is classed as a cheat. The EAC guys are working on that. Unity Analytics Again, another thing for us more than you. We removed our Google Analytics implementation and added Unity Analytics. Analytics is a funny word to spell, the trick is to remember to start with anal. Unity Analytics only really supports iOS and Android right now, because hardly any PC games are made with Unity. But we're using it anyway. We're not doing anything particularly interesting yet, just useful general stuff like the number of players, memory usage and the average framerate. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/13/2015-02-13_19-43-28.png Sprint Changes Instead of having to let go of sprint for a split second to use your melee weapon and then being able to sprint again, we've changed it so trying to use your melee weapon will automatically make you stop sprinting for a very small amount of time. This has the benefit of making melee less hectic as well as more user friendly. Item Condition & Gathering Helk has has changed how items lose condition when gathering, and how gathering works. Now each weapon defines explicitly how it behaves when it hits an object, such as how much to get, how much it wastes, and how much damage the item should take. The balance values aren’t final and are subject to change but what this does is give us a lot more flexibility to make each tool behave how we see fit. In addition, instead of gathering giving you some of each type of resource contained in the object, it will dispense only one type of item at a time. Harvesting will still take the same amount of time as it did before but you’ll get less resource spam and more of each individual type per hit. Development Thread We have a thread on our forums where you can post bugs and discuss the development branch. The idea is that this is the place to flag up bugs and problems with stuff on the development branch, so we can look into it and fix it before making it live. This isn't a thread for suggestions, ideas, bugs in the live branch (that you haven't verified exist in the development branch). Overall Balance I hate that I have to post this every week, but people think we think the balance is perfect if I don't. The balance isn't perfect, don't worry, it's an ongoing thing. Everything Else Canned food now gives you an empty can when eaten Empty cans can be smelted into metal fragments - in campfires! Stone spear now costs a wooden spear plus some stone Sleeping bag now costs 30 cloth instead of 50 Lantern consumes fuel Summary Kind of a slow week. We got some good stuff done, but apart from the roads and the reloading you're not going to see any benefits to it. Again, like we posted in last week's update.. we're not releasing an update today. It will probably come out on early next week.. and bad news - this update requires a total wipe of saves and blueprints. Server owners don't have to worry because this happens automatically - but I think we've got a responsibility to tell you that it's gonna happen before it does. Wipes are something we want to avoid as much as we can. Which is one of the reasons we're thinking about increasing the length of our sprints to two or three weeks between updates. Let us know what you think the solution is.",

You can walk on them. This is still in the programmer-art stage, but since it's got to work in millions of different procedurally generated maps we thought it was best to get it in and find any problems as soon as possible. http://files.facepunch.com/andre/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-06%20at%2020.12.18.png Reloading I started making a crazy reload system. Holding R bought up a reload menu, showing your weapon and all the types of ammo that could fit in it. Left clicking an ammo pile would add one of that type to your gun, right clicking would fill it with that type. This meant that you could have more granular control over filling your weapon, and when we have different ammo types you could alternate them in your clip. Then we realised that it was all a big load of shit, and no-one would ever really want to do any of that. So I just changed it to be normal reloading. Goosey had already made reload animations for everything - so it's already cool as fuck. Item System A while back we thought.. wouldn't it be cool if all our items were on a website, so we could all edit them easier, and even people who aren't programmers and don't have Unity could edit them and fill stuff out. And then maybe our artists could upload models and materials, and then it would all be downloaded in the game and just work. Then eventually we could open it up to the public so anyone could make new items, and people could vote on the items and we'd put the best ones in game. We fell into the \"premature generalization\" problem here. We were making a system before we knew completely what it was, how it would be used, how it could be used.

We're no longer going to release updates on a Friday, because it's stupid. We're going to be pushing our update out on Mondays. The devblog will stay on Fridays. The aim is to have it all ready by Friday on the dev branch, so that the early adopters that have joined the dev branch can test it all weekend, then we can fix any last remaining bugs before making it live on Monday. Which then gives us better opportunities to fix bugs during the week. What we really want to do is encourage more people to join the dev branch, so our stuff gets tested more before being pushed to the main branch. Raiding Balance We've removed the automatic health regen on building blocks. Freshly placed building blocks now have full health and upgrading a block gives it full health. You can repair a block with the hammer but it's going to cost you a fraction of the resources. Twigs http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/06/2015-02-06_20-29-18.jpg We have added a new tier of building. It's called the 'twigs' tier. It's weak and it's cheap. The idea is that you can quickly and cheaply lay your building out before proceeding to upgrade it. These blocks are very weak - so if you make a mistake it doesn't take long to smash one to pieces. Durability http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/06/2015-02-06_20-21-58.png We've also bought back durability - like in legacy. The idea behind durability is that it will punish you more if you're using a weapon wrong. For example, if you're using a hatchet to try to break down a stone wall it will wear out a lot faster than if you're using a pickaxe. This should make it more challenging for hatchet raiders, especially if you have upgraded walls. Because this is a big change please don't expect the balance to be perfect straight from day one. It's something we're going to watch and nudge the values around until it works. Pump Shotgun Tom, Goosey, Alex and Helk have done an awesome job bringing the pump shotgun to the game. It feels really meaty to use, like something from the original Quake. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/06/Desktop%2002.06.2015%20-%2015.38.38.09.mp4 Timed Explosive To make raiding more possible in the higher tiers, and to meet our baseline goals, we have added back explosives. The exact ingredients required to make explosives and the charge still need balancing, but the basics are all in. We're not sure whether tossing it will stay, or whether you'll have to go up and place it. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/06/Desktop%2002.06.2015%20-%2015.42.12.15.mp4 Ambient Sound Alex's ambient sound system is in! Currently it factors the biome you're in and the time of day. There's a base layer of ambience for each biome and a collection of one off sounds that are randomly triggered to break things up a bit. The map no longer feels like an empty game world, it feels like a world that is full of stuff. Gibbing Late in the week we worked out the foundations of gibbing. This is something we were sorely missing, and something that was going to get harder and harder to implement the longer we left it. Vince made some test gib models and I hooked it up. And it works! These gib models aren't 'done' - they were just made to test the theory of the system. We can start working our way through the models now, creating gibs for them. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/February/06/Desktop%2002.06.2015%20-%2015.44.46.17.mp4 Movement Changes There's been a couple of changes to movement. You can no longer sprint sidewards, diagonally or backwards. And you can't use your weapons while sprinting. This brings the movement in line with Legacy and it makes melee fights more feasible and interesting. It also gives you an opportunity to bitch about how the movement in Legacy was terrible and this is a step backwards, even though you'd posted the exact opposite thing a month ago. Other Stuff Fixed walking/running stopping when closing inventory menu Fixed chat box opening again on submit Chat has scrollable history Can click on avatars in chat to view steam profile Fixed too many vertices in canvas error if lots of chatting Fixed cancelling queue'd craft not returning resources Crafting can no longer take from or give to wearables slots Items are not destroyed if inventory is full - they're dropped into the world If furnace/campfire is full, will spit out items instead of losing them Added drop notice Added F2 options to hide hud/chat/branding Can toggle nudity censor in F2 menu F2 menu settings are now saved properly Added roof block Fixed supply drop parachute not closing Added explosives Added timed explosive charge Added Voice UI Added unique loot panels Can now loot player corpses clothing Added Building Privilege UI notices Fixed damage info being sent to the player delayed Added low health/bleeding overlay Added radius to some projectiles (arrows, shotgun pellets) easier to hit Fixed scrollwheel not skipping over items that can’t be held Summary My main hope for this week was that I could get some of the issues with the new UI fixed. But then we got a bit more ambitious. A lot of gameplay stuff. A lot of under-the-hood changes that are making our lives simpler. And a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff. We're aware that some of the stuff we've added isn't balanced. Balancing isn't something that we can get right on the first release. It's something that gets normalised through playing and iteration. So please don't be the guy who freaks out on reddit. Next week - more of the same. I'm hoping to get the network system transitioned to raknet - which should fix a bunch of network related problems people are having - and will probably add some new ones that people aren't having right now.",

        "contents": "http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/30/2015-01-30_21-14-32.jpg The One With The New UI New UI System We have switched over to Unity's UI system. It's not without its problems (which they're working on) but it's a lot better than it was. While I've moved the majority of stuff over, please keep in mind that this is just under two weeks of work. I have been concentrating on moving over the most important or most complicated features. So there are things missing - which I'm working on re-implementing. Menu Screen We want to make the menu screen less useless. We don't want it to be a screen that you use to get to another screen, we want to use it to keep you informed. You can see a tiny example of this now, as we link to the 3 latest devblogs. Server Browser http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/30/2015-01-30_20-09-54.jpg The server browser is a bit more comprehensive than the previous version. We have lists for LAN servers, favourites and history. You can add a server to your favourites by pressing the star next to its name. UnityUI is a bit slow at handling massive lists right now (they're looking into it), so I've limited the server lists to showing the top 200 servers. I'll also be adding filtering and searching tools at some point. Connection Screen A new screen. The connection screen shows the connection status. If you disconnect from a server it will show you why. If you press escape in game and come to the menu, you'll be able to use it to disconnect. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/28/2015-01-28_23-49-41.png This screen a bit if a placeholder. I'm hoping to add more features to this screen that let you have more interaction with the server. Think logos, MOTD's, admin lists, connection stats (ping etc), player reporting. Death Screen The death screen is now skipped if you've never been alive before. The left side is a bit empty right now.. but that'll change over the next few weeks. The right side should show respawn options. You can now choose which sleeping bag you want to spawn on. If you can't spawn in a sleeping bag because of a time delay, it'll show how long until you can use it right on the button. You can give your sleeping bags a friendly name in game. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/29/2015-01-29_11-51-35.png Sleep Screen The sleeping screen no longer has a wake up button. You can just press a button to wake up instead. Inventory http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/30/2015-01-30_20-15-22.jpg The inventory menu is now full screen and frameless. This has the disadvantage of obscuring all the stuff that's happening in the background, but it has the advantage of not looking like shit. It might be a bit big on larger resolutions. Next week I'll be adding some scaling options - so you'll be able to make it smaller based on your preference. Selecting Items You can select an item by clicking on it. This will show information about the item at the top of the screen, along with any options it may have (like eating food). This area is under-utilized right now - but we have plans that justify its existence. You also drop items using this method. I can appreciate that this sucks, next week I'll add options to drag out of your inventory to drop. Splitting Splitting has changed, and it's something you need to be taught. If you select a stack you'll get a split widget. Simply drag the bar to the amount you want to take, then drag the icon to where you want to put it. But that's not all: Left mouse button dragging a stack drags the whole thing Right mouse button dragging drags a single item Middle mouse button dragging drags half the stack It's our belief and hope that the three clicks required to split accurately is offset by the fact that you'll probably never actually do that, opting instead of use the middle/right mouse buttons. But we'll see how it works out. Blueprints http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/30/2015-01-30_20-06-35.png The new blueprints list have an \"All\" category. They also show how many you have unlocked. You can scroll through the list by dragging it up and down. The items you can't craft because of a lack of resources are at the bottom, the rest are ordered by title. When you are crafting something a timer will show up, along with how many others are queued. You can cancel an item you have queued by right clicking. This is a lot more simplified compared to the previous version - and you do lose a degree of control.. but we'll see how it goes. Tweaks http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/30/2015-01-30_20-04-43.jpg The tweaks window has been redesigned and has a few new options. It also shows the framerate, and has a framerate graph along the bottom. This should make it easier for you to see if changing the settings here has any performance benefit. I am noticing now that the grey background gradient is horrible, so I'll tweak that next week. Let me know what other options you want here. Chat http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/30/2015-01-30_20-12-23.png Chat now has steam avatars and admin/developer names are a different colour. Next week I need to add history and fix that white line at the bottom of all of the avatars. Vitals Nothing much has changed with vitals. Some of them show a bit more accurate data. That's it. Randomized Rad Town Layouts We are currently testing a system to partially randomize rad town and monument layouts based on the server seed. You can look at it as a simplified version of the AI Director in Left 4 Dead. It can for example remove or add walls, buildings or other objects from rad towns to make it harder for people to learn the exact layout and loot positions. The long-term aim is to force people to always be prepared for surprises when entering a rad town, even if they have seen this specific rad town type before. For now we are using this system very scantily in order to test that everything works as it should. At this stage it is little more than a proof of concept to see what kinds of randomizations could make sense when we design rad towns in the future, but expect to see or not see some rad town entrances and objects depending on which server you are playing on. Anti Cheat EAC has been turned off for the last week while the guys debugged why people were seemingly being kicked randomly. They've done that now - so it's back armed. Some guys have found that you can fuck about with the big resources file to create cheats. I could have spent time writing code to stop that, but the EAC guys are working on a better, more global solution for that, which should be ready quite soon. Summary Man, that's been a bit of a crunch for the last couple of weeks.. but it feels great to have got it all done. I'm going to spend next week cleaning it all up, fixing bugs, adding back missing features and taking feedback. I've added the Raknet source code to our native dlls too - all ready to be used.. so I'll have a go at that too.. which should fix some of the network issues we've had with lidgren. Let me know about any problems/ideas/opinions you have with the new UI either via @garrynewman or in the forum.",

It's not without its problems (which they're working on) but it's a lot better than it was. While I've moved the majority of stuff over, please keep in mind that this is just under two weeks of work. I have been concentrating on moving over the most important or most complicated features. So there are things missing - which I'm working on re-implementing. Menu Screen We want to make the menu screen less useless. We don't want it to be a screen that you use to get to another screen, we want to use it to keep you informed. You can see a tiny example of this now, as we link to the 3 latest devblogs. Server Browser http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/30/2015-01-30_20-09-54.jpg The server browser is a bit more comprehensive than the previous version. We have lists for LAN servers, favourites and history. You can add a server to your favourites by pressing the star next to its name. UnityUI is a bit slow at handling massive lists right now (they're looking into it), so I've limited the server lists to showing the top 200 servers. I'll also be adding filtering and searching tools at some point. Connection Screen A new screen. The connection screen shows the connection status. If you disconnect from a server it will show you why. If you press escape in game and come to the menu, you'll be able to use it to disconnect. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/28/2015-01-28_23-49-41.png This screen a bit if a placeholder.

Previously you'd always find boxes in the same position and most of the time they were empty. Now the boxes disappear when they are looted and respawn at a random position. We’ve also modified the loot tables quite a bit to be slightly more generous when it comes to boxes in rad towns. You will also notice that Rad Towns spawn barrels at random positions. This means no more dummy barrels! There are also different tiers for the barrels, some with better, some with worse loot. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/23/2015-01-23_19-47-21.jpg Updated Terrain Generation Terrain generation was updated with new sand dunes (including a new sand texture), small lakes and steep cliff. The overall terrain resolution was increased by a factor of four, which allows for more details in both the heightmap and ground texturing. The updated procedural generation algorithm also provides a lot more control parameters, which means we’ll have a much easier time to address terrain layout issues in the future. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/23/2015-01-23_19-49-11.jpg In addition to the improved terrain shape, the server now spawns around four to five times as many trees per world unit by default and a much higher percentage of the overall landmass is turned into forest. Bush density was also greatly increased and they no longer disappear a few hundred metres away but instead turn into billboards that can be seen from any distance. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/23/2015-01-23_19-50-32.jpg Last but not least, radtown placement was improved to fit the surrounding terrain in a smooth and more natural-looking way. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/23/2015-01-23_19-52-38.jpg Join Timeouts If you have a crappy internet connection you probably haven't been able to join a Rust server in the last couple of weeks. I've been looking at it and I'm hoping I've made stuff better for those guys but at the moment it does seem to be a universal problem with Lidgren. I'm keeping an eye on it and will evaluate our options once I'm done with the UI stuff. Satellite dish Vince has finished work on the satellite dish monument! It's got a lot more rusty. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/23/2015-01-23_20-11-46.jpg Admin Commands We've started a secret chat room for server owners to give us feedback, so have made a few changes based on that. All of the admin commands should now give a confirmation response. So if you add a moderator, it should now tell you that it completed successfully. Added removemoderator (steamid) Added removeowner (steamid) Added unban (steamid) Let us know if there are any other admin features you would like. I don't want us to get into a situation where you feel you have to install server mods to moderate your server. UI Progress I've been spending all week on the new UI. It's not ready yet. My plan is to have it ready for early next week, then put it on the development branch for testing - and then release it to main on thursday/friday. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/21/2015-01-21_17-22-41.jpg I have been having a lot of fun doing the UI. Unity's new UI system isn't totally without its issues, but I'm confident in saying it's the best I've ever used. Summary We resisted putting out patches during the week because they were going to require a wipe - so hopefully the patch I put out after typing this doesn't have any big problems. Something to be aware of is that even though the patch requires a wipe, it doesn't need to wipe your blueprint progression. So that's something at least. Next week we should have the new UI and the days of stack pickup hell will be behind us for good. Keep an eye on Rustafied and @RustUpdates for more info.",

After about 50 people have joined, and after a few hours, every few minutes everyone on the server would drop out. This turned out to be a problem with how Lidgren (our low level network library) recycles packets. The list of packets was growing that large at times that it was affecting performance of the network thread - which periodically stalled and stopped sending out data, causing clients to eventually give up and disconnect. This is another one of those bugs that we've been chasing our tail on for a long time unsure whether it was something we were doing or a ddos attack. It could have probably been avoided completely by using a tried and tested networking library from the start.. but I guess this is how network libraries become tried and tested. Missing Lock Weirdness This is a tricky one to explain, so I'm not going to bother. Sometimes on the client locks that we on doors weren't actually showing on the door, they'd show at the center of the world instead. And sometimes when saving we'd lose the fact that the lock was attached to the door. This meant that when loading that save the lock would stay on the door but the door didn't know it was there so didn't use it. Meaning anyone could open the door. This is fixed. Finally. New Jacket Xavier got a bunch of new jackets in. For now we've only put one in the game because we don't have UI to handle reskins yet, but there's a lot of verirty there for the future. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/16/2015-01-16_19-27-32.jpg http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/16/2015-01-16_19-29-30.jpg Assault Rifle Paul, Tom, Goosey and Helk have got the assault rifle in game. It's an AK47, but I don't think we're calling it that in game for some reason. Maybe because it's got a shovel handle. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/16/2015-01-16_19-52-04.jpg http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/16/2015-01-16_19-53-11.jpg Bear Trap Will kill animals and players, should be fun to see how this plays out with base defense, eventually it’ll actually trap things instead of kill them but lets see how this plays out, corpses of any object that trip it will stick around for quite a while so you can revisit your traps and see what they caught! Airdrop Fixed The airdrop was dropping an impotent package right in the middle of the map. The package it drops is now potent, and it drops it somewhere randomly on the map. The package also has higher value loot than can be found in the other loot spots, and you don't have to pay for it. Blueprints Like legacy, you now start with the limited ability to craft items. You need to find and study blueprints to be able to craft new items. We're still tweaking which blueprints you start with and which you have to find so please let us know. The blueprint data is decoupled from the map save data. So if your server administrator likes, he can wipe the map but keep your blueprint states. In the future I want to look at making the way this data is saved my available to server mods so server providers with multiple servers can share blueprint/player data between them. Radtowns Let me start by saying that this is all placeholder art. We got a bunch of models from the asset store and put them together. We're figuring out what works and what makes sense using this placeholder art before fully committing to creating our own art. We want more internals, we want you to be able to enter any building you see. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/16/2015-01-16_20-06-05.jpg The towns work very much like in legacy. There's buildings, there's respawning loot, there's radiation. Things might look a bit weird initially because we're still experimenting with telling the procedural system how and where to place these, and to modify the terrain around them so they look like they've been there for a long time. We have big ideas for Radtowns. Random Loot Barrels This is a bit of a placeholder which will be replaced/removed once we have more loot spawning monuments. Around the map you'll find barrels spawn randomly. Break them to get their contents which can be items or blueprints. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2015/January/16/2015-01-16_19-07-56.png This is part of the radtown strategy to give people more of a purpose to roam the island, and make it possible to acquire new blueprints. They won't be barrels forever. Everything Else Aiming down the sight provides a recoil reduction, crouching further reduces recoil, weapons have higher recoil in general now Bolt rifle now has no aimcone - bullet goes where you aim + gravity Fixed player corpses not spewing their contents when destroyed Fixed bug where lootables could become permanently occupied Fixed code lock not displaying its status in the world Fixed unducking when opening menu Tweaked how positions were updated over the network - clients should get more up to date information now Linux Many apologies to the linux guys. There's a bug currently affecting the current Unity 5 Beta that is causing a crash on startup. Hopefully this will be fixed in next week's update, all we can do right now is apologise and let you know we are thinking about you. Summary An awesome week. We're really flying now, making some great progress. The game is definitely fun to play again right now. When we aren't getting EAC and Steam Auth Timeouts the servers are performant and stable - even with 200 players. This is all awesome. Next week, bug fixes and balancing. I'm aiming to replace all of the old UI with new stuff, because we've been putting up with this shitty stacking/splitting system for long enough. And damage, drowning, on fire and bleeding overlays, so you know when bad things are happening to your body.",

        "contents": "Some developers like to lay out their plan for the future of their games in \"roadmaps\" which break down the path they intend to take from point A to point B. Garry Newman of Facepunch Studios is not one of those developers, but people keep bugging him about what's coming next. So, as an alternative, he's put together what he calls a \"mind-map\" for <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> that details&nbsp;his ideas without placing undue pressure on the studio. \"I don t want us to feel tied down to features and timescale,\" Newman wrote in the most recent <a href=\"http://playrust.com/devblog-38/\">devblog</a>. \"We re hobbyists at heart&mdash;we re not a game factory&mdash;we don t need that kind of pressure.\" The mind-map, <a href=\"http://mind42.com/mindmap/7abd1334-d170-42e7-b869-f74010b9b143\">viewable here</a>, is broken down into four basic categories&mdash;Priority, Strategies, Future Ideas, and Bugs&mdash;each of which branches off into multiple levels of increasing detail. The first priority on the list, for instance, (but not necessarily the number one priority) is Working Blueprints, which includes Blueprint Distribution, Saving/loading, and Limits; Blueprint Distribution devolves further into Radtown Monuments and Item Re-spawing, while Limits branches to Store Unlocked Blueprints, Send Player Unlocked Blueprints, and Limit Item Creation Via Blueprints. There's much more to it than just that&mdash;it's a big document with a lot of ideas on it. But it shouldn't be seen as \"ten tablets of stone handed down from God,\" as Newman put it. \"It's a rough, scatterbrain plan of our intentions and direction. Like everything we do, it changes and evolves.\" Facepunch recently released a <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust-update-wants-you-to-stop-building-and-start-exploring/\">significant update</a> to Rust that shifted its focus from building to exploration.

See Structural Integrity In Action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfaLd-OOm6A Well it wasn't the new build system. It was making buildings fall down.This has wrongly been referred to as a weight system. It doesn't take weight into account right now at all, in fact it's kind of the opposite. The intention was to allow people to be more free in their building, a specific example would be to allow people to build self supporting floors - without a pillar or wall under every floor block. This doesn't work without the structural integrity system because you could build sky bridges. Now we have integrity we can allow you to build floors on floors, because if it's wrong it'll just fall down.So let me be honest. I'm not a mathematical genius. I'm not a structural engineer. I don't know what I'm doing. This system isn't going to ever be 100% true to life. You will be able to build some stuff that defies physics, this is just the way we're doing it. We don't want you to not be able to make the legit structures that you've made before, we just don't want you building stairs to the moon.From a raiding point of view this is a total game changer. We don't know how it's going to affect stuff - but we're going to be watching, tweaking, improving, adding counter-measures over time. There are bug that we know about, and I'm sure there are bugs that we don't know about. Yes - it would be cool if falling blocks killed the player. It's all a work in progress.New Building System OverviewWe've rolled out the new building system. There's a few things I want you to know about it so you don't get angry at the wrong things.Building PlanTo place building blocks you need a Building Plan. Once you have crafted a plan and have it in your hands you can change the building component by holding down the right mouse button and left clicking on the part you want to use.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416578600.pngThe blocks start out black. This means they have low health. You don't have to do anything - they gain health by themselves. http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416577663.jpgWhen looking at at block you'll get a tooltip showing its current healthhttp://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416577702.pngIf the placement of the block is unstable it will also show the stability as a percentage and the background of the health bar will turn red.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416577758.pngHammerYou can speed up the blocks health gain by giving them a whack with the hammer. This changes their regeneration speed - which falls back down to normal slowly - so a couple of hammer wacks is all you need to do.When you're looking at a block with the hammer you can hold the right mouse button to see a menu. From here you can do things like upgrade/downgrade to another block type, rotate and demolish.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416578663.pngIf available for a block, when upgrading to stone (or metal) the block's maximum health will increase. This will make the block turn dark again - you know what to do here.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416578043.jpgSome melee weapons aren't very effective stone and metal, so it's a good idea to upgrade your blocks to one of those - especially exposed foundations.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416578167.jpgTool CupboardSome options on the hammer aren't available unless you're within the influence of an authorised tool cupboard. The tool cupboard makes it so only the people who are authorised with it can use building tools within its radius. The tool cupboard is craftable in the menu.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416578255.jpgOnce placed you should authorise yourself with it.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416578744.pngYou will see information on the bottom left of the screen describing whether you're within its influence.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416578313.pngWork In ProgressAll the models are basic geometry with placeholder textures right now. Real art will be coming soon. Some of the descriptions and icons are missing on the pie menu. The black overlay flickers sometimes. The placement guide block jumps all over the place. We're on it, don't worry.Weapon RefactoringI started refactoring the weapon system so that weapons are actual entities. They're just items right now and it's pretty limiting in the scale of things we're able to do.This is not going to be a short process so I've started another branch with the changes on, and am working on it periodically. So it's not done yet and when it's done you probably won't see any immediate benefits, but it will make stuff a lot easier for the coders - and we'll be able to make the weapons suck less.Map SizeAndre has added a server variable so server owners can change the size of the map for their server as they see fit. If you're a server owner and want to change your map, you can with the command line \"-server.worldsize \" where value is a number - default is now 4000.The default map size is now 16km2 - this is down from 64km2. This is a gameplay change, but should help out performance quite a bit.Window BarsYou can now add bars to your windows. You can look, loot, throw and shoot through them - but you can't walk through them.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/1416579766.jpgOptimizationsWe're hoping to see some frame rate increases this week. Andre did the tree thing, so they should be a lot faster now. Diogo has been tweaking the terrain shader - so that should be a lot faster now - especially on the shitter quality settings.We've got analytics running so we'll be able to see if there's a performance benefit. I'll post the graph next week.ChickensGoosey has been messing with the chickens again. See Video ..and Andre has put them in game and made them dance. They're not done yet though.Operation UnsuckWe're looking at ways to make the maps better. We're probably going to make a non procedural map (which will be playable), then generate the procedural maps from that. This will be easier than designing for a procedural map - as the programmers programming the procedural stuff will have a very good idea of what it should look like based on the non-proc map. No timescale on this.Howie and Paul have done some paint-overs to show some ideas of what the environment should/could look like.http://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/env_paintover_04.jpghttp://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/RUSTpaintoversnowy1a.jpghttp://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/env_paintover_03.jpghttp://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/env_paintover_01.jpghttp://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/env_paintover_02.jpghttp://files.facepunch.com/garry/2014/November/21/env_paintover_04_night.jpgRustafiedIf these devblogs aren't enough for you then you should really keep an eye on rustafied.com and their twitter feed, and maybe check out their server.

        "contents": "<a href=\"/rust-update-wants-you-to-stop-building-and-start-exploring/\"> </a> We don't have a Hammer Simulator yet because, well, that's basically what&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/rust/\">Rust</a> is sometimes. Facepunch Studios is aware that many players spend a lot of time, maybe <em>too much</em> time, hammering their abodes together in the survival adventure, so a forthcoming update with streamline the process. This means you'll probably spend more time exploring and gathering resources than, y'know, hammering. Apparently some people aren't happy about the changes though. Not enough hammering. \"I ve seen a few people comment that they don t understand why we re changing the build system,\" Garry Newman writes in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://playrust.com/devblog-34/\">new devblog</a>.&nbsp;\"They loved it, it was miles better than legacy, don t change it, please god don t change it. Well you probably should have said something before because all I ve heard is moaning.\" Once the changes are live, players will have a lot less hammering to do. According to Newman, resources rather than time&nbsp;should be the payment for building, and as a result exploration and gathering will be a stronger focus. \"Anything we can do to encourage players to explore, we should,\" Newman writes. Another reason is that the art cost was too high. \"Every component needed 7 different stage models (wood, wood2, stone, stone2 etc), this is a lot of art especially when you consider that things like stairs don t need that. The new system keeps these requirements low while allowing for the maximum customizations.\" The full notes are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://playrust.com/devblog-34/\">over here</a>.&nbsp; ",

You may also have heard grumblings from some corners of the community that Minecraft creator Markus \"Notch\" Persson \"sold out\" by taking the money and abandoning his game and, by extension, his millions of adoring fans to the fickle whims of of a corporate villain. But Garry Newman, the man behind indie darlings Garry's Mod and Rust, says he'd do exactly the same thing if he could, and you probably would too. Newman pointed out in a blog post that went up shortly after the Mojang deal was was confirmed that everything changes for an indie developer once he starts hiring people to work for him, because you're suddenly responsible for a lot more people than just yourself. Citing the case of Blitz Game Studios, which shut down in September 2013, laying off 175 employees, and then effectively re-launched in November under a new name, he wrote, \"Those are the guys you don't want to be.\" \"I am sure more than the top guys at Mojang became very financially rich due to this deal and that's something that should be admired not seen as a bad thing,\" he continued. \"Long story short, I d have done the same thing. The money is enough to very much take care of all the staff. The game is in relatively safe hands. Mojang s legacy is as a huge success story instead of a one hit wonder. Everyone wins. Can you seriously say you d have done it differently?\" No, Garry. No, I cannot. ",

The news comes via Garry Newman himself, who managed to drag himself away from mountains of cold hard cash for long enough to Tweet the news. Garry's Mod originated as a Half-Life 2 mod. It hit Steam in 2006 and, according to figures from April 2013, has earned over $22 million. More than a year later, and since the game went standalone earlier this year, that figure has no doubt increased significantly. As reference, the game had sold a mere one million copies back in 2011. Along with the new sales milestone Newman provided a platform breakdown for the title. The vast majority sold for Windows, 336,765 sold for Mac and 28,322 for Linux. As for the future of Facepunch Studios, Rust is still in development, albeit in Early Access, while Riftlight is a newly announced topdown shooter which looks pretty sweet. &nbsp;",

Deuce (working title) is being described as \"tennis crossed with Street Fighter\" and OK, we're going to have to examine that a little bit. Expect over-the-top characters, themed arenas and extravagant special moves: for instance, a teleport power that swaps the direction of the ball mid-flight. *Andy Murray's sullen head perks up in interest*. Deuce appears to be developer Ian James' baby, so don't expect Garry Newman or, indeed, Gary Numan to suddenly divert all of Facepunch's resources to this newest project. (Meanwhile, Gary Numan is probably working on an album or something.) The fact that Rust is in Early Access does muddy the waters a little bit, but development teams work on multiple prototypes all the time just usually in secret. Here's how Deuce is looking at the moment, from Ian's post: \"So far I ve pretty much got a functional tennis game with some placeholder special moves already in place. There s still some issues to iron out such as how and when to trigger special moves but I m iterating on these ideas all the time. There are also functional multiplayer modes including local and online play.\" There will be a \"large roster\" of playable characters, with concept art showing images of a moustachioed luchador and a Southern redneck massive stereotypes, in other words. It sounds pretty fun in a Mario Tennis sort of way, and it's obviously a massive departure from Facepunch's nudey survival sim, though perhaps not quite so huge a departure from the extremely silly Garry's Mod. If you're wondering, like a joking commenter under the reveal post, whether Rust, Garry's Mod and Riftlight have now been cancelled, here's Garry Newman's tongue-in-cheek reply: \"and half-life 3 sorry :(\" Thanks, Eurogamer.",

For instance, I ate a cheese, ham and pickle sandwich for lunch, and can only imagine that my decision has already sent someone into an incandescent fury. Luckily, what I didn't do was announce a new game. Facepunch Studios did, and the Rust developer is now faced with a backlash. The reason? Early Access survival game Rust isn't yet finished. \"Are we crazy?\" asks Facepunch's Garry Newman, who is about to drop some analogies up ins. \"Are we doing it wrong? Should every person in the company be working on the same thing? Should HBO make one TV show at a time? Should Warner Brothers make one movie at a time?\" The point, as you can probably tell, is that work on Riftlight won't affect the development of Rust. In fact, it's one of a number of games being developed by the company. \"Assuming read the full post and got all the information and are still angry... they are probably going to be even angrier to find out that we have three other prototypes being worked on by Facepunch staff.\" \"Our strategy at the moment is to hire talented people to make the games they want to play,\" Newman writes. \"We re not asking you to fund this. We re not starting a kickstarter and begging you for money we re funding it. \"We are spending money Rust and Garry s Mod make to do this. Arguing that we should be re-investing that money back into only those games is like telling apple they can t spend the money they made from iPhone and Macs to fund the development of the iPad. Keep in mind that we spent money Garry s Mod made to develop Rust and that turned out pretty good, right? Or should Helk and Pat have been working on Garry s Mod all that time?\" Newman points to the @RustUpdates Twitter account as a sign of the work that's still being done on the game, and also states his belief that \"funding\" a game is different to buying into Early Access. \"We funded Rust for 1-2 years before it eventually became what it is. You bought early access to it. When you buy a pizza you aren t funding Dominos, you re just buying a pizza. It s true that the sales of Rust have been insane and we have stepped up development to suit, and I think you only have to compare the experimental version to the live version to see that.\" Finally, Newman confirms that all the people who work on Rust are still working on Rust not the studio's other prototypes.",

It s a documentary series about a guy called Les Stroud who spends a week in the world s most inhospitable places deserts, rainforests, tundras and survives with only the clothes on his back. Fakers like Bear Grylls have doctors on hand, camera crews, and cosy hotels to return to after filming, but Stroud does it all for real and films everything himself. It s really good TV, and I promise that after you watch the first episode you ll be hooked. Anyway, what Survivorman shows us is that nature is terrifying, and doesn t care whether you live or die. These great, lonely expanses, whether it s the dense jungles of the Amazon or the icy plains of Alaska, are cruel, merciless places. Stroud is a seasoned survival expert, and even he struggles to find food or keep warm sometimes. Imagine if you were out there. You wouldn t last a day. So why do survival games always have enemies in them? Zombies, cannibals, wild animals it s completely unnecessary. Nature has already done the hard work and designed the most formidable, intimidating, ruthless villain imaginable: itself. Survival sim developers seem to think they need to include some kind of threat to keep players interested, but that really isn t the case. Being stranded in the middle of nowhere with no food, no fire, and night closing in is scarier than any monster. A survival game doesn t need conflict. There are other ways to keep a player engaged. There could be exploration elements; discovering abandoned camps or ruined buildings, and using them as makeshift shelters. There might be stories to discover, or clues to escaping the wilderness like an old map left behind by a hiker with a route scribbled on it. Or imagine finding something like Christopher McCandless bus, and reading his diary by a flickering campfire. But for this hypothetical game to really work, a lot of love would have to be put into the atmosphere and design of the world. You d need realistic weather and lighting, and stunning natural beauty. That s another thing I love about Survivorman: Stroud is always in awe of the majesty of his surroundings, but also respectful, and occasionally fearful, of them. With a large, diverse, and beautiful environment to explore I d love somewhere like a rainy forest in the Pacific Northwest I d play the game just to wander the landscape and see what I could find before nightfall. But let s say you re an indie developer making your dream realistic survival game, but the guy holding the cheque that ll decide whether the project lives or dies insists on some kind of danger. Well, in that case, you do it subtle. You make animal attacks rare, but possible. As you walk through the forest at night, you might hear a growl, or something stalking you. But it s unlikely it ll ever show itself; until that one, unexpected time when it does, and you have to run for your life. That would be infinitely more compelling than a million shambling zombies. One survival game that almost gets it right is Miasmata. I love the realistic character movement, cartography system, and being able to forage for plants to craft medicines. But then that stupid monster turns up and I lose all interest. The Forest recently added a hidden enemy-free mode (type veganmode on the main menu), but it s clear the game was designed with the cannibal natives in mind, and it feels a bit empty and aimless without them. No developer I know of has been brave enough to design a survival game without any threat. Who ll be the first?",

Fortunately, creator Garry Newman has confirmed that purchasers of the original Early Access release of Rust won't be left out in the cold. I spent a good chunk of time with Rust for an alpha review in January, and the short version is that I liked it quite a lot. But as good as it is for players, Newman told PCGamesN that it's a mess on the development side. The problem is that the game is rooted in a prototype for an open-world Hitman-style game that has very little in common with what Rust has become. \"There's a lot of systems that are integral to Rust that are 3,000 lines long, that could be 100 lines long,\" Newman said. \"So every time you go to change something you have to chase around finding how these five different systems that it doesn't really need work, then you change it and it breaks 4 different systems that you thought had nothing to do with it.\" With so much of the game needing to be changed, Facepunch decided to just start over again. The new version will simplify and speed development, and also bring changes to the interface, crafting and visual fidelity, all while maintaining or even improving performance. But this is all happening in an experimental development branch, while the original the one I played remains the default. Just to be sure, we asked Newman if gamers who have the old version of Rust will be given the new one, and the unsurprising answer is \"yes.\" \"They get the new version,\" he told us. \"We're still developing the same game, we just switched tracks.\" Rust is available now, in both the default and experimental branches, on Steam Early Access.",

        "contents": "The Steam Summer Sale is nearly halfway over and a number of games have been discounted tremendously, from classic games to more recent releases. However, the list of discount titles have also included offerings from Steam Early Access and that has caused some discussion among game developers. Some developers fall on the side that involving Early Access games in the Steam Summer Sale is a boon to their efforts. Their product may not yet be complete, but it would help push their game's development forward. Others feel that because the product is incomplete, it should not necessarily be treated like a finished game and that sales should come later. So Shacknews is taking a look at both sides of this discussion with the help of some noteworthy developers in the gaming community that currently have a horse in the Early Access race.",

I asked the Garry's Mod and Rust creator to show us his computer setup and he told me, flat out, that he doesn't use a standard PC. Then I asked him to send pictures of the setup and he included male genitalia on one of his monitors. Dude is messing with me. But when you're Garry Newman, looking in on the ridiculousness of the industry, you can do that. You can see the notion that a game developer should have some hand-crafted PC with a giant case and laugh. You can get an email from someone about showing off your rig and decide to have a little bit of fun. And his rationale for his non-traditional working setup is fascinating. What's in your PC? My work PC is a Mac Pro running Windows 8.1. 3.7GHz quad-core with 10MB of L3 cache 12GB (3 x 4GB) of 1866MHz DDR3 ECC 1TB PCIe-based flash storage Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each What's the most interesting part of your setup? Probably the fact that it's a Mac Pro. It looks like a bin. What's on your desk? Mac Pro, 2 Apple Displays (connected via thunderbolt), a phone that I never use and a printer. Do you have a gaming PC? No I don't have a gaming 'PC'. The Mac is probably more powerful and sexy looking than any gaming PC I could build. I've never had any problems with performance. PC manufacturers have kind of got it wrong for 10 years when designing gaming PCs. I don't want a computer that looks like a motorbike, I'm not 12 years old. I want a PC that doesn't look out of place in my living room. I don't want to have to lock it away in its own room. At one time I did build a smaller PC with a smaller case, but it was always a struggle to fit everything in, and even then everything was quite loud. Even though I use a Mac I don't use OSX. This kind of makes me a sinner in both camps. PC users hate it because I'm using a Mac (even though it's just a PC) and Mac users hate it because I'm using Windows. Blur added to obscure giant Rust penis. At home I have an iMac with Windows installed. OSX has a tool built in to let you easily install Windows. It's not running emulated, it creates a partition and you boot into it. I have one wire coming from my computer, and that's plugged in the wall to power it. The only disadvantages to using a Mac are the price and the fact that you can't really upgrade them (except for memory). To me this isn't a big deal because I'm rich as fuck so I'm more likely to just buy the latest model instead of trying to get 10fps extra in BF4 by upgrading the graphics card. My days of taking my PC to bits to make it faster are over. In the same way that I don't take my TV or fridge to bits and change components. This stuff doesn't interest me. I just want to use it. What are you playing right now? Banished. What's your favorite game and why? Ever? My favourite game ever is probably Black and White 2. I don't know exactly why but it's a game that I return to and play through at least once a year. Mr. Newman also sent a picture of his \"PS4/XBone/Steambox desk\" for inclusion: ",

Player Model You might be wondering why we haven’t added any player clothes since we released on Steam. Well that is obviously because the player model system is a huge car crash. All the clothes are included as part of the player model. I tackled that this week. The player model is now just animation data and we can drop models onto it. This means that in the future if we want to add a new set of clothes for the player – the artist just needs to model it. They don’t need to recompile the whole player. This is a huge deal to us because we want to explore customizing the player’s look a lot in the future. We want improvised clothing. We want blood decals. This makes that feasible. Player Animation Player animation is something that I think we can all agree needs a bit of love. So we’ve switched over to Mechanim. This means we no longer code our animation system in code. We use an nice friendly editor. This allows us to alter the animations nice and quickly, visually, logically. Did I mention that it’s really easy too?. <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/home/2014/April/29/17-46/13.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> The mechanim stuff has a bunch of cool IK stuff built in too. This means we don’t have to animate things like the player turning to face something, or looking up and down. We can do it in code – which makes it look a lot smoother. We can even place the hands and feet on world objects. This opens up a lot of possibilities for the future. Here’s what it looks like when we force the player model to point at a cube. This isn’t one of the possibilities. <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/home/2014/April/29/20-49/m17d.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> Player Shadow The player now has a shadow. This happened on accident and we decided we’d keep it in. It does feel quite nice in game, and gives you a greater sense of being there <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/16_RB4.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> Netcode The network code is pretty much feature complete now.. and we’re currently testing it. Replacing the netcode might sound like a daunting task, but it turned out to be pretty simple. Early this week we were happily jumping about with other white cubes building campfire bridges. <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/home/2014/April/27/18-11/6.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> One of the big scary systems in the netcode went in this week. The PVS culling system. It’s a pretty simple system in theory. You divide the world up into a grid, then the player only gets information about stuff in the cell he’s in (and the surrounding cells). But there’s a lot of moving parts. You need to account for objects moving from one cell to another, you need to tell players in the cell it left that it’s now gone, and players in the cell it entered that it now exists, and what if a player is subscribed to both cells? You need to account for players moving between cells, you need to send players entering a cell the contents of that cell, you need to tell them to delete the contents of cells they’re leaving. But from tests this seems to have all worked out. So we got networking working, threw the player models on the players. Now we are at this stage. <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/23_EmA.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> Procedural Maps Andre is working hard on the procedural maps. They look a bit like the Windows XP desktop background at the moment, but progress is going well. We’re really pleased with it. <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/17_LLM.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> It’s very early days in this development but it’s at a place where I think we’re ready to share it with you. It isn’t finished, there’s a lot we want to explore. This doesn’t rule out specifically made maps, but I think there’s a lot more value for money in this method, where the server owner will generate a map from a seed.. so every server you go on could potentially have a completely different map. Dan’s Stuff Dan has been keeping himself busy, as usual. Alex & Minh’s stuff Alex and Minh have been doing awesome work this week on the view models. The viewmodels currently use two different rigs. Which make things hard for us. They also all have the hands included in them. There will come a stage at some point where we’ll want to swap the hands out with a different pair. So we’ve been working on unifying the whole system.. which is more work than you would think. But we’re making progress. The viewmodel system has been changed to use Mechanim too. It was previously using an insane amount of custom code – which we’ve managed to completely make redundant. <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/14_evZ.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> Tom’s Stuff Tom, desperate to restore his reputation, has been working on a rocket launcher model this week. Experimental Branch The experimental branch is on Steam, and you can join it if you want to watch the development. But if you’re more interested in playing Rust I would stick to the current live branch. You might lose your settings and stuff if you switch to the experimental branch and then switch back. But here’s how it’s done. <a href=\"http://files.facepunch.com/garry/26_ZLt.mp4\">Watch/Download the video</a> Our plan right now is to port everything back over to the experimental branch until it’s in a playable, feature complete condition. At which point the experimental branch will be the default branch, and the current live branch will be put on a legacy branch. This means you will still be able to play the old branch if you want to. We won’t be forcing anyone onto the new system that don’t want it. Reposted from <a href=\"http://playrust.com/friday-devblog-6/\">here</a>. ",

        "contents": "Hey guys, another Friday Devblog. I’m going to try to keep this one short and sweet. Sorry – turned out neither short nor sweet. Network Recode We use uLink in our current implementation of Rust. We have been mostly happy with it. We had issues when we first launched with DDOS attacks. Servers could be taken down really easily with just a few packets. When we mentioned it on this site we were surprised by how reactive the uLink guys were. A few DDOS exploits were fixed, and more were discovered and fixed. Eventually everything was fixed, we all agreed that their support was top notch and we were very happy. Then a couple of weeks later the CEO emailed me asking to ‘help correct some mistaken information’. He also mentioned that they were changing their EULA so that if we made another post about bugs that hadn’t been fixed they’d revoke our license. From our point of view the only reason these exploits were eventually fixed was because we made that post. We could have easily posted a ticket and waited over two months with no resolution again – but in the meantime no-one could play Rust. Then a few weeks later we got another email asking us if we’d like to buy a yearly support license. It cost 25 times more than our existing yearly license.. or we could buy a yearly full source license, for 50 times our existing license fee. I asked what we were paying our existing license fee for. We don’t want to pay them for access to their source code so we can fix it for them. But on balance even though it did feel like a bit of a shake-down we decided that we’d made enough money from Rust so far that we could justify the ‘support license’, especially with how much their engineers helped us over the holidays. At this point we got distracted with a bunch of other issues.. then one of their engineers made it clear that they’ve been told not to help us with any of our issues until we have a support agreement, because they have to “prioritize on tasks that are economically sensible”. So we decided to write our own networking library. Don’t get me wrong, the decision wasn’t totally based on pettiness and spite. We also have a few technical reasons to do this. To do what we want to do we need more control. Don’t worry, this isn’t something we decided yesterday. We decided it a long time ago. And the good news is that the new implementation is pretty much finished and ready to be tested. (I don’t like announcing intentions, I like announcing results) We’re obviously not going to inflict this change on everyone without testing it properly, so some time in the next couple of weeks we’ll have an experimental build up on Steam for people to help test it so we can iterate and evolve. Oh and because we’re awesome this new implementation lets the server and client co-exist in one build. So you can make listen servers, and single player versions. We’re not totally sure whether that’s something we’re going to make available straight away.. but it not having to compile/create/join a server every time you change code sure makes development a billion times faster. Other Stuff Here’s what the artists have been up to. Dan made some new barrels! Tom made a hammer Gooseman made a bear And a Deer When is the next update? So what’s likely to happen is this. Some time in the next 2-3 weeks a new branch will appear on Steam. The community will be split in two. New and old. We’re not going to take the old branch away from you until everyone is in universal agreement that the new branch is the future. And even then we’ll probably keep the old branch anyway – just for a laugh. Reposted from <a href=\"http://playrust.com/friday-devblog-4/\">here</a>. ",

        "contents": "I don’t look forward to posting these updates. Each one of these devblogs is a reminder of how much we’re failing you. So here’s what’s been keeping us busy this week. Humble Store We put Rust on the <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/rust_storefront\">Humble Store</a>. We didn’t sell Rust anywhere but Steam, because it’s early access and we’re actively developing we didn’t want to whore it out everywhere. Honestly – right now, the less people playing it the better. But Humble Store changed our mind. 10% of all sales go to charity. So we decided it wouldn’t hurt. More Item Editor I want to explain more about the Item Editor. I want to make it clear why we’re bothering, and why it’s awesome. So let me walk you through how the <a href=\"http://admin.playrust.com/item/edit/3533/?tab=oven\">Camp Fire</a> item works. If you click the link above you will see a number of modules. For any item these modules can be turned on and off. World Model controls what the item looks like when you drop it into the world (right click > drop). This could be a different model to what it normally looks like. It could be a sack for example. Container means that this item can contain other items. You can specify what type of items, and whether these items are accessible in the inventory, world model and deployed. Crafting lets you define blueprints to make this item. Deployable means this item can be placed in the world when selected in the belt bar. The oven lets you specify the temperature this item and its contents reaches when switched on. And then we have events.. these events all add context options to the fireplace. So when you right click in the inventory or ‘use’ in the world, you are presented with these options. These events have conditions. So for example.. the “Ignite” option won’t show if the fire is already on, or if the fire doesn’t contain fuel. So here’s how that looks in game when you use the item. So the fire works. What about cooking stuff? Well, that’s generic too. <a href=\"http://admin.playrust.com/item/edit/1/?tab=event&subid=1\">Take a look at this page</a>. As you can probably see.. this event gets run when the temperature is between 150 and 250. When the cooked var reaches 100 the action gets run. Which is to swap the current item with a cooked version. This is nice and generic, nice and open. We can easily add an event to cooked chicken so that if t’s cooked for another 60 seconds, it becomes burnt chicken. Then if it’s cooked for another 60 seconds it becomes charcoal. This exact same logic can be applied to a furnace object, or a freezer – without any extra coding. So what about fuel? You need to put wood in the fire, right? Well technically not any more. We can add the <a href=\"http://admin.playrust.com/item/edit/514/?tab=burnable\">burnable module</a> to anything and it instantly becomes a fuel source for an oven. Other Stuff So that’s been keeping us busy. Dan has finished the <a href=\"https://trello.com/c/ssMj4kiy/51-bear-trap\">Bear Trap model</a>, and Alex has animated it. Alex and Tom have started <a href=\"https://trello.com/c/q2bslIhy/56-player-model-r-d\">investigating a more customizable player model</a>. Tom is also <a href=\"https://trello.com/c/7fRHAOhg/47-wv-rock-models\">finishing off work on the new rocks</a>. Andre has been <a href=\"https://trello.com/c/H5OBO1tC/287-first-person-controller-changes-to-explore\">exploring the possibility of dumping viewmodels and using the player’s model instead</a>. Time Scale We made a bold decision this week, which will mean that the next update will either come a lot faster than we’re expecting, or a lot slower. We’re hoping it’s a lot faster, and I hope I have more to share about that next week once we’ve walked the path a while. Sorry again for this huge update void. Please understand that when we released Rust we didn’t expect anyone to buy it, so we thought we had lots of time to slowly remove shitty placeholder code and replace it with super awesome future proof code. We expected to slowly build up a following while we were developing. We need to make drastic changes to the codebase to be able to continue.

The more you change, the more you need to change. You get into the situation where it’s quicker and easier to replace existing code than integrate it with the new system. That’s what’s happening. The Item System The old item system was a bit of a mess. So it was re-coded. We now load items via JSON. Which is generated by the item editor website. You can add modules to an item in the editor website to add functionality. There were a few features on our wishlist for the new item system. Items need to all have size and weight. We need to make items be able to store other items inside them. We think this will open a world of emergent gameplay if we can pull it off right. For example, you could possibly put some poison inside some chicken. You could put a key in an apple and feed it to a pig. There’s a lot of options here. We’re hoping that by being able to add universal components to items like this, we’ll be able to make the system more open ended. An example of this is the ‘throwable’ component. The axe, the flare and the pickaxe should all be throwable – right? Deployables A deployable is something in your inventory that you place in the world. The deployables system is being re-written too. This isn’t such a big deal, because it kind of works exactly the same. But unlike the old system, the new system keeps hold of the `item`. This means that it’s feasible to be able to pick deployed items back up. Internally this makes the code cleaner and more generic because we can use exactly the same inventory code to browse the contents of an item in the inventory when it’s deployed in the world. Weapons and Tools The weapons system is being re-coded too. We’ve only just started this so I don’t know of any obvious improvements. One of our dreams is to make reloading more involved with modern weapons. We don’t want you to just press reload and it somehow, in the background, takes your clip out and fills it up with bullets from your inventory, then puts it back in. We want you to go into combat situations will your clips loaded. I am probably alone here.. but I want you to sit in your home, manually dragging bullets into clips. Then when you’re in a battle situation, you’ll hold down reload and choose which clip you want to swap to. This way, when we introduce different types of ammunition (tracer etc), you’ll be able to put them in your clips in a specific order. I’m sure a lot of people don’t see that as a good idea, but I see it as a good way to ‘nerf’ modern weapons in a common sense way. Building System We’re going to change the building system a lot in this pass. We’re not ready to talk about that yet though :) Clothing We haven’t modified the clothing system yet – and will probably just make it ‘work’ without many changes in order to get the update out as soon as we can, then return to it again later on. Timescale All these changes come at a bit of a cost. You want updates, and we can’t get them. We’ll try to get the experimental branch in a workable state as soon as possible.. but right now we’re looking at least a couple of weeks more. I know it sucks, and I wish we didn’t have to do this. But again – once this is done we will have some serious traction to push things in the direction we want to be headed. Source: http://playrust.com/",

So that’s what we are going to do. Even if that means every week we post “replaced 6000 lines of terrible code with 1000 lines of not so terrible code. NO UPDATE?!?!? We understand you want weekly updates filled with a shitload of new content. To make that possible things need to change. So we’re working. That’s why we haven’t been posting updates. I think the important thing for people to realise is that when we launched Rust it was still pretty much a prototype. Most (if not all) of the code is terrible. I’m sure people have decompiled rust and thought that their decompiler was broken. It isn’t – that’s the code. Replacing this code isn’t a matter of programmer pride. It’s something that we need to do to push forward. The code is very limiting right now. It’s hard to understand and there’s too much of it. Once it’s all cleaned out we’ll be able to push on and iterate faster. If we try to do that now we’ll end up spinning ourselves into a web. This is a lot of what we’re doing now. Replacing old terrible, complicated systems with clean, tidy, future proof systems. Trading Cards As some people have noticed yesterday we released our first set of trading cards. I was hesitant about posting about this yesterday because I knew the comments would be filled with “NICE RELEASE TRADING CARDS BUT NOT UPDATES”. So let me clear this up. Our programmers didn’t make the trading cards. We’re programming. We didn’t delay releasing updates so we could make trading cards. We wanted to release this set of cards during our early alpha to capture where we’re at right now. The hope is that every 6 months or so we’ll release a new set of cards capturing the state of the game, the community and events surrounding it. I think Meg and Rob have done a great job on the cards and the backgrounds, and I hope you agree. New Inventory System One of the code systems that is getting totally replaced is the inventory system. Why? Well, this. You can literally open any of these inventory files and find code that doesn’t explain itself. Code that uses ambiguous variable names. Basically, shit, unmaintainable code. This code is also tied very harshly into our old GUI system, NGUI. Which in the next update is completely replaced by our new system of choice, DFGUI. (Which will probably be replaced again by Unity’s new GUI system when we eventually move to Unity 5 in a few months (which is why this new inventory code is very much UI agnostic)). I know what you’re thinking. You don’t care what the code is like. What does it mean for you? And we agree. It’s be a waste of time if we re-wrote a bunch of code and everything was the same. So we are changing things up a bit, making previously impossible things possible. Here’s a look at the prototype UI for the new menu. This is obviously quite early in the development and a lot of stuff is missing, but I think it shows a few things that the new system has that the old one doesn’t. It’s scalable, so if you’re playing in a large resolution, or on the TV you will still be able to see what you’re doing. You can queue and cancel crafting items. Text labels are all unicode, which means we can support translations. The biggest change is that it now uses the new item system, which is enabled by the new item editor (which is also a WIP). Summary We have been distracted by stuff over the last couple of weeks. I had some business bullshit on my mind. Helk has got some rather significant family health problems. I’m back at it hard now and Helk is slowly recovering and getting back to work. We are working for you, but please keep your expectations reasonable. We’re still a relatively small team. Just because we’ve sold a million copies – it doesn’t mean we’re going to hire 1,000 people. More cooks do not make a better game. That said, we are hiring if you’re awesome so hit us up!

The very instant I popped into the world I heard a voice behind me, yelling. Who are you! It was more of a statement of rage than a question. Shocked, I turned and saw him. Silhouetted against the sky, a man stood atop a wrecked building, stretching a bow and pointing an arrow at me. His name was Blazing Bazing. He was completely naked. &#8230; ",

Here's a tip: don't run around at night with a lit torch or you'll get shot. I know this because I once ran around at night with a lit torch and got shot. That's why, more recently, when I was alone and lost in the middle of the night, I only lit my torch for a second to take a quick look. Here's another tip: don't light your torch even for a second to take look around or you'll get shot. I did. For a second. And I got shot. In the early-access crafting survival game Rust, I'd recently become stuck in a comfy rut. I'd made some friends and together we'd created a safe valley neighborhood there seemed no real reason to stray from. With plenty of resources to gather and trade and a network of helpful neighbors, I was finding this notoriously violent and unpredictable game a bit, well, humdrum. Eventually, I became curious about what else the world of Rust had to offer. What lay outside my peaceful valley? What was down the road? What was over those hills? And what was over whatever was over those hills? Also, I just accidentally got lost one day and really had no choice but to step out of my comfort zone and start exploring. So, there I was, completely lost, at night. I lit my torch to get a look around just for a second and someone immediately opened fire from close by. Bleeding, I ran away and someone chased me, continuing to fire. I was about to run out of blood, and perhaps he was about to run out of bullets, because we both stopped at about the same time. I crouched, bandaging myself, trying to hide in the grass. I could hear his footsteps circling nearby. I started eating all my food, just so if he killed me there wouldn't be much to loot. Yes, while crouched bleeding in the bushes, I ate five cooked chicken breasts simply out of spite. Finally, in stable condition again, I took off running. He either lost interest or lost sight of me, and I didn't hear him again. Huh. Now I'm the weirdo creeping around people's houses in the middle of the night. As I ran through the night, player-made buildings loomed at me from the darkness. Some small and simple, some grand and complex. As soon as one passed from view another would appear, the creations of dozens of players I'd never even seen in all my hours spent on the server. Most of the homes were dark and silent. Very occasionally, I would overhear a snippet of conversation as two or more players worked through the night on some crafting project, locked safely in their communal home. Sometimes, while pausing outside a building with windows, a pink face would silently peep down at me through the gloom, then retreat from view. It's always darkest before the dawn. Except in Rust, where it's darkest all damn night. I reached the ocean at dawn, and yet another large building overlooking it. Who was building all of these structures? How did they find the time? This server had been wiped clean and reset less than a week ago and despite spending some eighteen hours playing I'd barely managed to prop up my ugly, three-story hovel and help my friends with a couple small side projects. Some of these buildings I was seeing were preposterously huge and intricate. Many were incomplete, and nearly all seemed completely unattended. That house has more stories than Isaac Asimov. AM I RITE I continued on as the sun came up. I ran through the day, passing dozens of shelters, shacks, homes, strongholds, and forts. I kept running as the sun began to go down, and ran through the night again. Soon I began to see fewer buildings, and eventually, none at all. When the sun rose again, I couldn't see evidence of another player in any direction. I saw no more wild animals, no more irradiated beasts, no more logpiles to chop or even boulders to mine. Just hills, dirt, and trees. I was in the wastelands. Leave only footprints, take only pictures. Because there's simply nothing else TO take. For two full days and nights I sprinted. I sprinted until my hand began to cramp from holding down the keys. There was so much nothing, acres of nothing. Miles of it. One night I built a tiny dwelling and a campfire on the tallest hill I could find, just so there would be something to look at. In the middle of nowhere, I added a little somewhere. I spent the night cooking in my shack and crafting whatever I could just to give myself something to do. The next morning I started sprinting again. Two more full days and nights I ran, and still, nothing. No people, no buildings, no animals, and except for trees no resources. It's impressive how massive the world of Rust is, and it's bizarre how empty that world can be, especially when it feels so crowded in other spots. For days, the only proof I wasn't alone on the server was the steady scroll of inane blather and accusations of hacking in the global chat window. Eventually, I found the other edge of the island and tried to psych myself up for a long, finger-cramping run back to civilization. Before I left, I decided to see what happens when you step into the ocean in Rust. Spoiler alert: you die instantly. While I was a little disappointed I wanted to make it all the way back home again on foot I was also relieved because I was damn sick of running my way through all of Rust's nothingness. I respawned at my sleeping bag in my house. And there I was instantly confused. When I spawn in my house, I usually find myself staring at one of my four walls. Instead, I was staring at the rocks and trees of my home valley. Why had I spawned outside? My three-story house has become a one-story hole. A moment later I realized I had spawned inside. It was just that my walls were gone. As was my ceiling. And door. And my stairs. Oh, and all of the stuff I'd spent long hours collecting and crafting. Someone had blown my house apart and taken everything in it. I'd been raided! Damn! I ran off to find adventure and excitement and it had happened to my house while I was away! I ran over to my neighbor's massive home, to see if he'd seen anything. His house was missing some doors and walls, too. I ran to all of my friends' homes, and they were all blasted open, empty, silent. The whole neighborhood had been sacked. I spotted someone coming toward me across the valley and I ran to meet him. \"Hey, do you know what happened?\" I asked. He shot me dead instantly. I respawned in what was left of my house. \"What happened was,\" the stranger said in text chat, \"I killed you.\" Twice more that day I was shot and killed in the fields I used to feel safe in. The valley was no longer full of friendly people I knew, it was full of violent people I didn't. My workbench and forge had survived the raid, so I spent the next day and night scurrying around the valley, collecting all the resources I could. I crafted a gun, some ammo, and some new walls. The only thing I didn't have enough metal for was a new door, so I huddled in my house until morning, guarding my meager stash. While other players freely text-chatted about Mass Effect, I spent the evening pointing my loaded pistol at the open doorway of what used to be my home. They're talking about the indoctrination theory. That's not going to help me stay awake all night. I eventually got my hovel rebuilt, at least the ground floor, though who knows how long it will last. As for my group of friends, I haven't ever seen them again, not on that server. There are new structures being built in the valley all the time, but I'm shot dead whenever I go near them. I'm no longer a part of this neighborhood. It's under new management.",

It's the dead of night and I'm in my cabin, which, at the moment, is essentially just a box. But I have plans for expansion. Big plans! Like adding a second box. Next to the main box. So it'll be two boxes. Anyway, I'm crafting with the spoils of my daytime scavenging and hunting. I've got ore simmering in the furnace, food cooking in the campfire, and I'm banging together some new building materials at my workbench. That's when I hear footsteps outside. They approach slowly, crunching through the grass, until they're right outside my cabin wall. Then they stop. Then... nothing. Having a house in the Early Access crafting survival game Rust comes with a few benefits. Drop a sleeping bag, and now you have a place to respawn. Build a workbench and a forge, and now you have a place to craft. Build a storage box, and now you have a place to store your materials. There's a downside, however. Once you've got a home, you've got neighbors. And neighbors love to drop by. A sleeping bag, a roaring fire... oh, and some creep outside peekin' in. Take this current visitor, who has walked up to my cabin and is apparently standing just outside. I hold my breath, straining to listen. I'm nervous. I mean, I know my door can't be opened by anyone but me, and my tiny cabin is almost certainly too small for someone to bother wasting explosives trying to get in. But still... there's someone some other human person standing right outside my walls in the middle of the night. I extinguish my forge and campfire, plunging my cabin into darkness. I hold my breath. There's some shuffling outside. I can barely see a human figure crouching in the moonlight. He's peering through the narrow gaps in my walls. He's a virtual foot away from me and we're staring at each other through a crack in the wall. It's... unsettling. I fire a shotgun blast at the wall, knowing I can't hurt him from in here, but mostly to let him know I actually do have a gun and I'm not AFK. He crouches there a moment longer, then I hear him walk away. The next night, again, I hear footsteps approach. This time, they stop right outside my door. \"Hello,\" says a hollow, monotone voice. \"Hello. I'm friendly. You can open your door.\" Somehow I'm not convinced. He circles my house a couple times, reassuring me in his odd, flat voice that it's OK to let him in. I sit inside, eyes wide, until the footsteps recede. Compared to the people in Rust, bears are nothing to worry about. The next day I build another room onto my house, and put in some exposed stairs leading to what I plan to be the second floor. Around dawn, I have another visitor. I douse my flames and listen while the footsteps go from the grass outside to the boulder next to my house. Then there's a clunk as he jumps onto my roof. Whoever he is, he's walking around directly above me. \"Anybody home?\" a voice asks, knowing full well that somebody is home. \"Anybody? If nobody's home, then... I'll just tear down these stairs.\" There's a splintering noise as he starts smashing my new staircase. I have no idea if he can actually ruin my stairs or not, but I'd prefer he didn't. I go outside. \"What's going on?\" I ask him. He walks off my roof and lands in the grass. He's wearing only pants, and holding a rock. \"Come here, and I'll show you.\" I walk over, because in general I choose to be trusting. Also: I am extremely stupid. He immediately begins trying to smash me with his rock. I pull out my pipe shotgun and fire. Naturally, I miss. The only thing worse than a guy who might have a shotgun is a guy who definitely has a rock. We have a merry little chase. Him, trying to bash me with a rock while hopping around like a kangaroo, me backpedaling, firing wildly, missing, and trying to reload my one-shot boomstick. Finally, I make a buttonhook around my house, slither up the boulder, and slide down the other side to the grass. He follows but makes the mistake of leaping off the boulder. He lands with a crunch and drops to the ground, where his prone body appears to suddenly be sleeping. I assume he's dead, but just to be safe I shoot him at point blank range. His body vanishes in a spray of blood and is replaced by a backpack. He's carrying nothing but starter gear: torches and two bandages. And his rock. The dude from Part 1? He's still looking out for me. With a big gun. So, it seems I've been welcomed to the neighborhood, Rust-style! It's not all bad though. The kind benefactor from my first diary entry lives a short distance away, and drops by every so often to see how I'm doing, to give me the local news, and to brutally kill any interlopers he spots. When I tell him about the guy who tried bashing my head in, and how long it took me to kill him, he says, \"Yeah, when someone comes at you with a rock like that... it's hard to kill a naked jumping man.\" Meanwhile, this ninja brandishing an axe? He was super nice. I'm also starting to be recognized in the valley. Not all strangers slink around my house in the middle of the night: many come over and introduce themselves. My friend has friends, soon I learn their names and get comfortable having them around. We share resources if someone has a project going. We swap news, stories, and advice. If someone accidentally gets shot (which happens), apologies are made. If someone accidentally gets shot and killed (which also happens), gear is politely returned. It really feels like a little neighborhood. A weird, violent little neighborhood filled with irradiated bears and mostly-naked men. Now the sight of naked men running toward me is a happy one. It means I'm home. Speaking of the neighborhood, it's sprouted some new buildings. The next time I log in, someone has built a wide three story building with barred windows and a series of ramps leading up one side of it. I'm impressed: it's taken me days to build a tiny three-story, and someone arrived and threw this together alone in a few hours. However, as you can sort of see in the screenshot, our new neighbor left out an important detail: one ceiling section. Word around the valley is, as soon as he logged off, everyone in our 'hood climbed the side of his house, jumped through the roof, and looted his storage crates. I have a look inside myself: the place has been entirely cleaned out. He hasn't been back. I guess it pays to get friendly with the locals before building a condo on their block. Walls are important. Doors are important. Ceilings? Super-important. Speaking of friendly locals, it's now been days since I've had anyone creep around or try to kill me, which makes me think that perhaps I'm leading a too-sheltered life. I've got my cozy corner of the server, and it's great, but maybe it's time I left it for a bit, to get a true taste of the outside world. Maybe it's time I went walkabout! I should point out, I don't make this decision. It's sort of made for me. After a day of hunting, I've run back to the cliff where my house is located, but when I get there my house is missing. It's because I've run to the wrong cliff. I run to another distant cliff, but it's the wrong one as well. Two things occur to me: I'm completely and utterly lost, and the sun has gone down. How hard could it be to find my way home? Alone? In the dark? Oh god no. You know how Bilbo Baggins went There and Back Again? Next week, I try to do the same.",

The new update will include big updates to Unity s audio and lighting tools and 64-bit engine support, according to Unity Technologies. Unity 5 will be available for pre-order starting today, and is accompanied by a trailer featuring lots of flashy light rendering and a wub-wub distortion soundtrack. Every time we ship a new version of Unity, we re looking to empower developers with technology that's more powerful and easier to apply than ever before, David Helgason, CEO of Unity Technologies, wrote in a press release. With the huge additions of physically-based shading, lighting workflows, a new platform, and a new built-in method for user acquisition, we re improving Unity dramatically from both a creative and business perspective. Unity has also partnered with Mozilla to bring the game engine to WebGL, meaning that Unity games could run inside Firefox without any additional plug-ins. Mozilla has written up a full post about the collaboration here, and the Unity booth will be showing off this ability with in-browser builds of Dead Trigger 2. Users who pre-order will also get access to the current build of Unity 4 and all planned updates. Unity 4 launched two years ago, and has provided the base for games like Rust, Kerbal Space Program, Gone Home, and Surgeon Simulator. Thanks to Aaron San Filippo, developer of Unity game Race the Sun, for the tip.",

By now, we're completely familiar with the basics of crafting games. You hit a tree until it becomes tree parts, then use the tree parts to build wooden things. You smash a rock until it becomes ore, then smelt the ore to build metal things. You meet a half-naked guy named Batman, and he follows you around for ten minutes eerily moaning, \"Take me to your house. Show me your house. Show me your houuuuuse.\" Actually, that last part might not be common to crafting games. But Batman's weirdness is not that unusual in Rust, the early-access crafting survival game from Facepunch Studios. My first day in Rust was not particularly unusual. I found some trees and hit them. I saw some rocks and smashed them. I encountered some animals and killed them, and encountered some monsters and ran away. I saw the creations of others and became determined to create things of my own. Standard stuff. Use this thing to smash those things, right? Pff. Who needs a tutorial? Then I built a campfire and tried to cook the animal meat I'd harvested, but not understanding how to properly use the campfire, I accidentally ate all of the meat raw, and then began vomiting onto my campfire. Then I died mid-vomit. That part wasn't quite so standard. Campfires give you comfort, a place to cook, and a spot to die barfing. My first night in Rust, I ran around with a lit torch, looking for somewhere safe to spend the night, finding only darkened cabins with locked doors. Some wolves attacked me, bit me, and chased me. I found an empty shelter, a simple wooden room with no door, and hid inside. I was hurt from wolf bites, I was trapped by the wolves themselves, I was hungry but had no food, I was cold but had no fire, and I was taking radiation damage from something nearby. Eventually my torch ran out and I died in that little hut, in complete darkness. Where's the 'domesticate wolf' button? The next day, I decided that if I was going to die alone in pain and misery, it should at least be in my own doorless hut. So, I crafted a stone axe and ran around I whacking trees all day. I also met some of the locals. Another player ran up behind me and screamed, ear-splittingly, into the mic, then ran away laughing. I met Batman, as described above, and tried to ignore his soft, hollow moans. Someone else passed by and, when I said hello, said something so profane in response that I'm not sure it can be reproduced in writing without adding a few new letters to my keyboard. Don't give me those doe eyes. Though if you do, I'll probably wind up eating them. Another half-naked man approached. \"Frosh Man,\" he said. \"Do you have a bandage?\" I said my name was \"Frohman,\" and that I didn't have a bandage (not realizing that new spawns actually have two by default) and he started walking away. A moment later a gunshot rang out nearby and the half-naked man started screaming. \"Frosh Man has a gun! Frosh Man tried to shoot me! Oh my God. Oh my God. Frosh Man tried to shoot me!\" \"It wasn't me,\" I told him. \"I don't have a gun.\" \"Oh my God,\" he repeated, running around the map. \"Everybody, stay away from Frosh Man. He has a gun. He tried to shoot me. Stay away from Frosh Man! Oh my God!\" He continued loudly accusing me of violence until he disappeared over a hill and his voice faded. Eventually, I collected enough wood, then built my shelter just as night fell. In the corner, I placed my campfire, and carefully carefully inserted some raw chicken breasts I'd gotten from a deer I killed (yes, dead deer give you chicken breasts at the moment). I cooked them and ate them, and I suddenly felt better about everything. I had a whacking tool and a shelter and warmth and enough food, and thus had cleared the first hurdles in every survival game. Maybe everything would be okay. Then, another half-naked man, this one pointing a shotgun at my face, suddenly slipped into my shelter. Maybe everything would not be okay after all. I'm pretty sure I know how this particular campfire story goes. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Is this your first time playing? You really shouldn't have a campfire going in the middle of the night, everyone can see it.\" \"I'm pretty new to this,\" I admitted. \"I just needed to cook some food before I starved to death.\" I waited for a blast of gunfire, or failing that, a blast of profane derision. \"Here,\" he said. \"Take this stuff.\" From his bare torso, bags began to fly, one by one, until they littered the ground in front of me. He gave me wood planks. He gave me ore. He gave me walls, pillars, a roof and a doorway. He gave me storage boxes and a smelting forge and a sleeping bag. He gave me a shotgun, and tons of ammo. As we ran together through the night he answered my crafting questions (\"Can you build a compass?\") and game questions (\"Is there an in-game map?\") and my personal questions (\"Am I naked?\"). The answers: no, no, yes. He gave me some pants. When another player tried to kill me with an arrow, my guide fired his shotgun and chased the attacked away. As dawn came, he showed me a good spot to build my house, in a place called Resource Valley. Campfire, forge, sleeping bag, crates, and half-naked protector. Cozy as can be. It was amazing. By showing my complete ignorance to a stranger in this crafting game, I had somehow crafted the perfect item: a guardian angel, a tour guide, a mentor. A friend! Within the hour, I had a real house built, with walls and a roof and a door that only I could open. I had crates full of loot and a gun full of ammo, all due to the generosity of my tutor. Thanks to him, I had a home. A house just isn't a home without a welcome mat. Of course, once you have a home in Rust, you have something else as well: neighbors. But we'll get to that particular peril of homeownership next time.",

Then we want to open it up to the public – like TF2 did with hats. Obviously items submitted by the public wouldn’t automatically appear in game. We’ll be looking through them, you’ll be voting on them, we’ll be editing and accepting them and making sure it all works. That’s our dream anyway. The website side is really easy. It’s getting the items in game that’s a bit more involved and might take a couple of weeks.. because a lot of stuff needs replacing. The good news is that it’s all crap and needs replacing with a better system, and once we’ve laid the foundations we’ll be able to add new items like it’s nothing. The New UI As part of these changes above we’re making a run at changing the UI. This is something we’ve been wanting to do for a while. At the moment we use a GUI system called NGUI. It’s the devil. Our version of the devil is quite a bit worse though because it’s been chopped up and edited. So we’re working to get rid and use DFGUI – which is what all the menu, chat and popup notifications use. So why bother updating the UI when there’s so many other things that need doing? Well – we’re doing it because of those things. Right now we’re restricted by the UI because we know we want to replace it eventually so we’re putting off adding things (like putting stuff in stuff, weight effects etc) because we don’t want to write code to throw it away.

The arid multiplayer survival sim drops players into the middle of its world mostly naked and armed only with a rock. Silliness inevitably follows, and is often captured by streamers, and those who keep an ongoing record of their in-game lives for posterity, who happen to have caught some farcical moments along the way. We've rounded up a few of the best Rust videos so far, featuring a determined and oft-killed in-game reporter, sky wolves, a house beneath the sea and more. The Rust Reporter Nothing highlights the absurdity of Rust better than Argyle Alligator's running commentary. Slipping into the role of intrepid investigative journalist, he scours Rust's brown wastelands for incidents, and finds himself saying things like \"there is a mutant wolf trying to attack a man and another man is helping him with a rock ... a bear has joined the chase!\" And watch Argyle interview players in this equally-good video. Naked Conga You take many risks when you enter the world of Rust. There's the risk of starving, or being eaten by a wolf. There's also a risk of being co-opted into a nude conga at gunpoint by the \"Penis Brothers\". That is the risk you take when you enter the world of Rust. How to deal with bandits What do you do when a bunch of raiders come knocking with shotguns? The answer, if you're Youtuber \"bill gates\", is to kill everyone. This guy is good at Rust. The god of gifts Now let's turn to the altruistic side of Rust. If you're going to give away items to other players for free, you might as well do it properly, with a couple of dramatic campfires and a booming voice. Would you take this guy's offerings? Oompa Loompa murder How did this player find themselves in the middle of a murderous circle of bandits bopping up and down to the Oompa Loompa theme? Anyway, it happened, and here's what happened next. The best possible use for bullets YouTube comment: \"I dit it it freakin fun to do it but it costed me like 60 bullets lol\". Worth it, surely. Rust's Rapture Water doesn't always work quite as it's supposed to in Rust, which is why you can apparently lay down lit campfires while submerged, and build huge underwater towers. Death by sky wolves Where's all that barking coming from - OH GOD NO THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE SUN. Rust is still in very early stages. For all the group frolicking/murdering we've seen in the videos above, it's still a very buggy game in this alpha state. That's assuming that flying wolves ARE a bug, and not some ingenious feature that we've yet to fully comprehend.

We did want to get it out last week but we don’t like running the risk of having something broken over the weekends. So we opted to wait a couple of days instead. New Sky The biggest most obvious change in this update is the new sky. We’re still tweaking to get it looking how we want it to look. So why bother? There’s hundreds of other things you want – why bother changing the stupid sky? Well I’m glad you asked. The old sky was a slow horrible FPS killer. It rendered using two cameras.. which induces a bug in Unity that meant we couldn’t (without a bit of hacking around) have refraction effects in game. Everyone should see a nice framerate boost thanks to the sky being replaced. And it renders in a single camera – which means we’re free to use the refraction effects again (so expect to see pixelated penises again). One gameplay change the new sky might have is the with mr moon. Depending on the moon cycle night is no longer pitch black. We think this is a good thing. There’s a few rendering issues that we hope to fix as we go on. One is the tree lighting. Distance trees appear too bright. This is something we’ve battled with before – and as far as I’m aware it’s a Unity3D bug because I’ve seen it happen before. I’m sure we’ll be able to solve it though – so please excuse any issues like this for now. We’re working towards making it as perfect as we can. New Water As a happy consequence of the sky being replaced, we were able to bring you much better looking water. We expect water to play a bigger role in the game as we push forward (instead of the death plane that it currently is). So having it not look terrible anymore is a big win for us. There’s an extra option in the options menu to turn reflections on/off, as they do have an effect on performance. When you turn reflections off, it’ll still reflect the sky. Which has no real performance effect and stops it looking terrible. OSX and Linux Fixes We hired the new sky’s creator, André Straubmeier last week and as well as improving the sky for Rust, he’s been making Linux and OSX work properly. So Linux and OSX users should now see the grass being rendered properly and be able to join the game with high graphics settings (which is apparently caused by compiling for 64bit, we’re going to investigate that further). Item Durability You know how you’ve had to replace your mouse and keyboard 3 times since you got Rust because you’ve used them so much? Well now you can experience that feeling in game too. Items will now become damaged in game due to repeated usage. Items can be repaired at a workbench. You can keep repairing your items but eventually they’ll just get that unreliable that you’ll want to throw them off a cliff. Armor also loses condition when damage is taken, so you’ll probably have to eventually throw your pants of a cliff too.",

In multiplayer survival sim Rust, nudity is encouraged, but using software to disrespect gravity, walls, or augment a human's natural aiming ability is punishable by permanent ban. CheatPunch, a new anti-cheat system described in yesterday's update notes, has already detected and banned 4,621 players. CheatPunch currently only monitors official servers and unofficial servers which choose to run it, but Facepunch Studios implies that it will be mandatory \"We re testing it out on our official servers to make sure it all works before forcing it on everyone else.\" Bans will be permanent and there will be no appeals. \"If you get kicked from the official servers with the message that you ve been banned then you have been caught,\" reads the post. \"You re a naughty boy. You know what you have done. You won t get unbanned. We know it was your 9 year old cousin. We know your computer got hijacked. We know that the CIA is getting you banned from all your games on Steam so you will join them in the hunt for aliens.\" Despite kicking nearly 5,000 players, Facepunch calls CheatPunch a \"stop-gap solution\" and says it's \"not hard to get around.\" \"We fully expect cheats to be touted as CheatPunch proof quite soon,\" reads the post. \"That s cool. We re never going to be finished fighting.\" And we may never be finished hitting each other with rocks. At least the 4,621 players banned represents less than one percent of the one million players who own Rust. Assuming the software makes accurate accusations, the honest majority wins and can continue to torture and murder each other in peace.",

Poke around the community for a bit, and you'll find more good times in a game with such a sheer degree of freedom. Those flashes of spontaneity are just a small part of why Rust is really cool. Its success is, by now, not a big surprise after a pretty strong early access alpha and taking the top spot for survival RPG player activity, but today marks another notch in Rust's handcrafted leather belt: it's sold over 1 million copies, as tweeted today by Facepunch founder Garry Newman. As a comparison, it took Garry's Mod a little over five years to hit the same sales milestone since launching on Steam in 2006. More impressive is the fact that Rust is still in alpha, with Facepunch continually tweaking and updating the game as it nears a full release. Rust first arrived on Steam Early Access on December 11. Last week, Facepunch pushed out a sizable patch that removed zombies from the game entirely and improved animal behavior beyond derp levels. A million sales in almost exactly two months--not bad for a WIP title with a warning line of contains violence and caveman-themed nudity.\" We've got our own thoughts on Rust's alpha right here.

Your ramshackle hut, built through sweat and tears, stands for the your accomplishments. The weighty rock you use to crush an interloper's head like a grape? That's just being a friendly neighbor. And the zombies...well, I still don't know what the zombies mean, but they're pretty annoying. So much so, in fact, that Facepunch's latest update yanks them out of its sandbox survival-thon entirely replacing them with less-stupid animals. \"The longer we keep zombies in, the more complaints we d get about removing them,\" Facepunch writes in the patch notes. \"We are forcing ourselves to deal with it. We are no longer a zombie survival game!\" Instead of walking corpses, we'll now meet red bears and wolves with a similar appetite for eating your face off a temporary swap, Facepunch assures, until the reveal of something fresher in the future. The patch also fixes wildlife calmly standing around in the vicinity of gunshots and predators along with numerous bug squashes and performance tweaks. Oh, and we get more rocks. Here's the rest of the changes: Fixed bugs with the level (such as rocks intersecting buildings) The \"oil tank\" area has been modified with cover Workbenches make you craft faster when standing next to them Added new player animations Improved melee attack animations Added locked backpacks and lockpick test (off by default) When you die, your backpack is locked for everyone else but you for a time Someone else can use a lockpick tool to bypass this time Lockpick tools are a default blueprint You can't use lockpicks on doors The amount of time the backpack is locked for is per-server and can be set with the command player.backpackLockTime seconds (can be turned off by setting player.backpackLockTime to 0) Footstep sounds will never play the same sound as the one previously played Grass textures have been improved Rust is pretty cool and it's already generating its fair share of memorable moments though it still shows some rough spots in its alpha state. Rust's Steam page houses the update's full notes, if you want to take a look.",

Even though VAC is doing a great job, a lot of people think it’s not responsive enough. What use is a hacker being banned in a week, when he’s on the server annoying you right now? We agree. So we’ve been talking to a few different companies about other anti-cheat solutions. If we go for one of these, we want it to be super super lightweight. We don’t want to force you to install an obstrusive third party program. We don’t want to make you sign up for another system. We’re also taking steps to deal with some of the more obvious of these problems ourselves. This is something we’re hoping you’ll start seeing the results of quite soon.. but please understand that we’re doing this from scratch – and these things take time. The very last thing we want to do is rush out a system that accidentally bans legitimate users – and then have to unban everyone. There needs to be no doubt that a specific steam account has been used to cheat. It’s important to realise that there’s a lot about our anti-cheat measures that we can’t talk about, for obvious reasons. So it might look like we’re not doing anything about cheats. But please keep in mind that making the game as cheat free as possible is in our interest just as much as yours. It’s our game, of course we care. Early Access We feel like we aren’t making it clear enough that the game is Early Access. Rust is still in development. This isn’t 95% finished, like a regular beta. This is 10% finished. We’ve got the bare bone foundations of a game here. We’re still developing it. This isn’t just is trying to make excused for putting out a buggy game. This is how it is. Update Speed We really feel like we’re letting you down with the slow release/size of updates. We’ve been trying to throw out weekly updates, but this isn’t consistent. We’re looking at our work-flow and trying to identify ways to get stuff done faster. A lot of this is us thinking to ourselves “is spending 2 hours tweaking the colour of that texture a good use of my time”. But there’s a lot of ways we want to enpower the community to help us out. These are things we’re thinking about right now, and stuff we hope to be experimenting with in the future. Trello We have a Trello up with issues and stuff. This is just for us. You can see what we’re working on, and we’re trying to post updates regularly on the cards so you can experience the progress. This isn’t all we’re doing, we have a private board too – to hide some surprises/secret stuff we’re working on. This isn’t somewhere for you to post bug reports, issues or requests – but you can certainly sign up and give us a vote on the cards you think are important or are looking forward to. Server Stability The huge attacks we were seeing on our servers a month ago seem to have stopped. We have reports of people attacking individual servers, this doesn’t seem to be any more of an issue than in a game like TF2. Servers do start to suffer once they’ve had 200 people building stuff on them for a week or so. This is something that was impossible for us to test before we had 200 people that wanted to play. We are looking into performance issues, and fixing them where we’re can. This is an ongoing thing. Server Hosts We’re not looking for more GSP’s right now. We’re happy with the small group we’ve got. We’ll make a news post appealing when we’re looking for more. Popularity We are blown away by the popularity of Rust so far. It doesn’t even seem real yet. Our original plan was to release on Steam Early Access, without making a big deal of it, and slowly build up a bigger fan base by releasing regular updates, until we reached a point where we felt the game was ready for a bigger audience – and then start advertising it and bringing more people in. The unjustifiable popularity is both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing because we’ve sold 750,000 copies in a month and a half, and this is an amount we never even imagined selling over the game’s lifetime. We’ve been the number one best seller for two weeks, we never imagined ever being listed. Rust has already made us 2/3rds the amount of money that Garry’s Mod has made in 8 years – and we never imagined reaching GMod’s popularity ever again. We’ve been the fourth most played game on Steam at points, reaching 50,000 online players – this is more than we could have ever dreamed of. But it’s also a curse because the amount of people playing has kind of given us a sensory overload. We see all these amazing things happening, voices from all directions, ideas, bugs, cheaters.. and we’re scrambling to catch up with everything. So please don’t be offended if we’re not doing what you want us to, if we don’t respond to emails or tweets, if we’re not administrating the servers properly.

They welcome in Sega Mobile's Ethan Einhorn and Area 5's (and former 1up Show alum) Matt Chandronait to break down what happened this week with everything involving Microsoft, EA, and Machinima, discussing how it could potentially affect an audience's perception of YouTube content providers. The talk then turns towards the world of mobile game development and how much of a brave new world it becomes for newcomers, especially those coming in from the media. The crew then recaps the <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/tag/best-of-2013\">Shacknews Best of 2013</a> (particularly <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/game/gone-home\">Gone Home</a> at #3 and the gradual backlash that's built across the online sphere towards The Fullbright Company's game) before jumping into the many possibilities presented by remote play through the Vita, the Wii U GamePad, and Nvidia's Shield.

Life is hard in the multiplayer survival game (read our alpha review to find out why it's worth playing), but with the right knowledge, you can at least make it through a day. Which brings us to our first tip: Check the time. If sundown is approaching, consider quitting for 20 minutes and coming back at dawn. It's cheesy, but spending a night in the open without food or shelter puts you at a real disadvantage. Your first steps The rock: Your best friend in the early going. Once you're ready to begin, equip the rock in your inventory, then find a pile of logs and hit it to \"harvest\" wood. Trees will do as well, but they provide far less wood for the same amount of work. Keep your eyes open for free-standing boulders and do the same to them to gather stones, metal ore, and sulfur ore. Work quickly, and when you have ten wood and five stones, press \"Tab\" to enter the inventory, pull down the crafting menu and make a stone hatchet. Bye bye, rock! Log piles are far better sources of wood than trees. While you continue collecting wood and stones with the hatchet, keep your eyes open for animals. There are two you can kill at this stage: boars, which you can outrun, or wolves, which you won't have to. Wolves will mess you up badly, but you can usually take one down without dying by walking backwards and hitting it with the hatchet while it attacks; even so, do yourself a favor and try to find a boar. Be careful while you're stalking your prey, because unlike the real world, the animals in Rust get along fabulously and where there's boars and deer, wolves and bears often aren't very far away. If you don't get at least five cloth from your first kill, find another animal and do it again. Killing pigs with a rock isn't the worst thing you'll do in Rust. It's probably best to avoid other people during this delicate time. Some of your fellow players may be very helpful but there are a lot of griefers out there too, and while it's easy enough to get away from a guy with a rock, dodging a spray of bullets is another matter entirely. Pay attention to the conversation to get a feel for how things are going; if you see a lot of players complaining about being killed (and they will most definitely complain) you should probably keep a low profile. You can also simplify your life by turning off the grass with the F1 console command \"grass.on false,\" entered without quotes. The denuded landscape isn't as pretty, but it's a lot easier to see things on the ground. On the next page, craft shelter, armor, and weapons... Let's go crafting! It may not look like much, but it'll get you on your feet. Collect as many resources as possible until hunger or darkness sets in, then craft a wooden shelter and place it in an out-of-the-way corner by putting it in a quick-access slot and then selecting it. Craft and attach a door the same way, then go inside, lock up, and make a campfire. Place and start it, then press and hold the \"Interact\" key and click \"Open\" when the menu pops up. Put the raw meat you collected from your kills it will all be chicken breasts, by the way into the \"Cook\" square and give it a few minutes to roast up into a tasty meal. Meat won't go bad, so cook as much as you can. Your hovel holds all the necessities: fireplace, furnace, workbench, and sleeping bag. With the food on the grill, go back into the crafting menu and whip up a bow and a bunch of arrows 20 or 30 at least. You'll need 35 wood and five cloth to make the bow, which is why you may need to kill multiple animals with your hatchet. The bow isn't terribly accurate but it hits hard and makes hunting a relative breeze, and at this stage that's what you need. A simple bow eliminates most animal dangers (but watch out for bears). If you have sufficient cloth remaining, make armor; if not, whip up what you can, then eat up (at least some of the chicken should be cooked by now) and go hunting. Depending on how much was left over after building the bow you're going to need 40 to 50 pieces of cloth to make the next big jump in progress, so don't be shy about killing everything you see. Once you have enough, get back home and craft whatever armor remains unmade plus a sleeping bag. Place the sleeping bag on the floor of your cabin to create a respawn point, then build a wooden storage box, place it and put excess food, wood, stones, and whatever else you can spare inside. Having a stocked-up respawn point makes bouncing back from death a lot easier assuming nobody comes along and blows it up. Gearing up and getting serious &nbsp; By now you should have a good supply of basic crafting materials, so at this point the game becomes less about staying alive and more about transitioning from prey to predator. Use animal fat and excess cloth to make low-grade fuel, then use that and some rocks to make a furnace. Wood, metal, and sulfur ore goes into the furnace; charcoal, sulfur, and metal fragments come out. Use wood and stones to make a workbench it'll be crowded in your little hut but everything will fit as long as you're not too sloppy with the layout and with all the necessary furnishings in place you can craft a proper firearm, plus gunpowder and ammunition. Stay away from places like this until you're packing heat. It's a lot to do in a single day but with a good jump on the morning and a little bit of luck, it won't be much trouble at all. And now, properly armed and armored, you're ready to strike out into the world. But keep the bow bullets are scarce. Good luck!",

Here we try new alphas and revisit old ones to separate the promising gems from the bug-ravaged time wasters. This week Craig goes full Bear Grylls, and throws himself into three different sandbox survival games, DayZ, Rust and 7 Days to Die. DayZ's arrival on Steam Early Access was the most prominent and most talked about of the people-vs-people-vs-environment releases, but it wasn't the first. Just a week before it came out, Facepunch (of Garry's Mod fame and fortune) released Rust, a DayZish game focusing on crafting yourself up from a sort of pre-industrial spawnee to a land-camping hermit. And just a few days before that, 7 Days To Die landed, bringing with it all the technical panache of an animated gif of a PS1 game. I've spent lots of time scrounging for survival in all three, but are any worth supporting on Early Access? The nature of these games means there's a lot that can go wrong. At least Bohemia was clear about what they released, with this warning displayed prominently on the store section usually reserved for game info fluff: \"WARNING: THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME FUNCTIONING.\" It's not as typographically terrifying as they made out. I've lost a few characters: at least two have vanished in the dark hours when I wasn't playing the game, one died after a small fall from a short ladder, and I had to leave one to starve to death in a sort of limbo when I fell through a floor and couldn't get out. There are other issues: zombies will pursue you through walls, fences, and doors, which wrecks an otherwise carefully cultured sense of immersion. But thanks to the all-caps, I was prepared for this. Overly prepared, actually: those were just moments in almost 20 hours of zombie dodging. It hasn't crashed at all, it mostly runs smoothly (on an 580GTX, i7, 8BG RAM system), and my latest character has been alive for over a week. The internet is rife with tales the dirty sandbox, though my own tales are of a man watching the horror from behind a bush and backing away. It's capable of remarkable things, and in this stage I've already had more than 20's worth of fun from it. I can similarly recommend Rust. Rust was a DayZ combo-breaker for me: until I tried it on a whim, I'd spend my evenings yomping across Chernarus Plus. Now I flow between the two. It's a surprising survival game from the Garry's Mod developer, set in a world where you start off with a rock, a torch, and a medkit. Through endeavour and/or murder, you gain better tech. It's thematically similar to DayZ: a multiplayer sandbox where you're up against people and the environment (zombies, radiation, animals, falling down a ladder), but the details matter here. You can make a proper impact in Rust's world through the crafting system, which allows you to build tools, clothes and, most importantly, buildings. Your first night will be spent scavenging the land, hitting trees with a rock to carve out wood, and hitting stones to grab the makings of a hatchet. With that, you have the ability to gather things more speedily, which should allow you to build a shelter and a door. The world is strewn with little huts, built to house new spawns spat into the cruel world. With a hatchet to hand, and a generous pile of crafting recipes, it's possible to have a little single-room hut all of your own in a short span of time. They're dotted about the land, monuments to the people that came before, often abandoned. I've wandered the strange map (it's huge, but only has one road), climbed a mountain range, strolled across lonely plains, and everywhere I go has at least one abandoned shack clinging to a rock face like a lost goat. They're the base-level of the game's base-building: there are mazes, towers, even entire villages to discover, outposts of the people who play. Rust is a bit more cartoony than DayZ, but the players are no less barbarous. It is a survival game after all, which means you could go to the trouble of gathering the material to craft a bow and its arrows and hunt the wildlife for meat and cloth, or you could just find someone who's done it and beat them to death. I've been killed on sight many times, and I have stories of people luring friends into buildings and locking them in, tossing scraps of food in and taunting them. It might be awful, but it allows for people to be creatively vile. It's also remarkably well put together for a game supposedly released early, though like DayZ it suffers from the attention of hackers. In fact, that's the biggest technical trouble it currently faces, with wall-hackers able to wander into your locked buildings and loot your wooden palace. It does feel like an early access game, with obvious placeholders, missing text, and moments of immersive fumbling (chicken breasts being looted from dead pigs and bears, for example). Still, I find it hard to be angry when the sunsets are so lovely, and the dead of night comes alive with torchlit human endeavour. That's more than I can say for 7 Days To Die. It's way more expensive than both DayZ and Rust, and though it's craft-supported open world zombie survival sim, it's just not very impressive. If the idea of Early Access is to show off something that people might want to be part of and support, it just made me want to flee. It's an ugly game, and not in the artistic way the apocalypse can be. It has bad textures stretched over bustable world blocks (a la Minecraft), terrible animation, and incredibly awkward action that feels like it's running twice as fast as it needs to. But I think the sound is the most off-putting part of the experience: a soundtrack that attempts to evoke the dread of being surrounded by the undead, but with all the restraint of a hungry zombie. Everything makes a weary zombie sound, and it can feel like things are near you even if you're alone. Worse still are the reactions from a zombie when you assault them: one punch elicits a groan; further strikes - and it takes many to put one down - will create the effect of hitting the button on a soundboard over and over, piling zombie squelches up. It has almost no immersion or sense of dread, and the world is full of oddly placed objects to loot. Why am I looting birds nest and air conditioning units? If there's one thing it has going for it, it's that it leans heavily on crafting. The loot is everywhere, and your inventory enables you to combine objects to craft helpful items. It mostly makes sense, so if you place a pile of sticks in a line they become a club, or a fill out the sleeping bag template with cloth gives you something to place as a spawn point. In addition, every building can be barricaded by breaking down internal walls and filling doors and windows with those blocks. A multiplayer game I played at least had a little bit of ebb-and-flow to it as we tried to survive a zombie assaults by plugging the windows with broken down bits of the house. But after the tedious, flappy fighting against the witless AI, all I wanted to do was wall myself in. So two out of three aren't bad, and in fact both show a huge amount of promise. It's impressive that DayZ and Rust are capable of offering different things within the same space: DayZ is more of a survivalist game, whereas Rust's messy timeline invokes hunter-gathering. DayZ is about the fall of civilisation; Rust, if it has a goal other than to survive, is about the creation of one. Both are strong foundations for the developers to build on, and both are good games right now. That's more than can be said for our third contender. Like one of its infected antagonists, 7 Days To Die shambles, groaning, at the back of the pack. Is it worth playing right now? DayZ: Yes Rust: Yes, check out our Rust alpha review for more. 7 Days to Die: Nope, not yet. Have you played this week's alphas? What do you think? Are there any alphas you'd like Craig to try out? Let us know in the comments!",

Please don’t take that to mean that we’re rich now so we’re abandoning Rust in favor of jetsetting around the world. We’re doing it for you guys! In the meantime, here’s some stuff that is important to us – that we will be working on and thinking about. Sales and Online Players Sales have been strong. Stronger than strong. We really have been knocked on our arses by sales. Our plan was to release the alpha on to Steam in a low-key way and slowly build up steam until the game was in a decent state. But our player counts have exploded our wildest dreams. So we’ve obviously felt a bit shell-shocked by the popularity explosion we’ve seen and it’s scrambled our plans a bit. We’ve had to work with GSP’s to bring more servers online – and make them more manageable via RCON and stuff. This is something we didn’t think we’d have to do for a while because we thought we’d only need about 10 servers. Then we had the DDOS issues – which has taken a week or two to get past (we’re still seeing residual attacks on individual servers/websites – but for the most part they seem to have subsided). So thanks to everyone that has joined us on our journey so far. We’re going to be working hard to help you justify spending that $20 on our early alpha game and hope you enjoy the progress we make over the coming year. Cheating Well over 1,000 people have been VAC banned from Rust for cheating. We have also done a lot of work on both the client and server to make some cheats impossible. That’s not to say that cheating is eradicated. That’ll never happen. Even if we somehow manage to totally stop software based cheats.. people will still be wrapping dental floss around their monitor to form a crude crosshair. But it should now be pretty clear and obvious to people that VAC is active and if you cheat you stand a good chance of being banned. So don’t. We have been looking at other cheat solutions. Things like Punkbuster don’t really appeal to us. We don’t like the idea of forcing you guys install a cheat client on your PC to play Rust. Especially since VAC is already installed and works just as well. There are serverside solutions like Fairfight – which do appeal.. but we’re not so sure of their effectiveness or accuracy. The last thing we want to do is ban legitimate hard working players. It’s an area we will continue to test and review. Client Performance It pains us to see people posting videos and screenshots of Rust with the grass turned off. They are obviously doing this for performance reasons – and if it gained us 20fps extra we’d turn it off too. Performance is something we’re keeping a close eye on and looking for opportunities to improve FPS at every turn. Server Performance It’s not something that most of you have probably noticed or even care about. 128 player servers run kind of great. 256 player servers are pushing it. 512 player servers are non existent (I don’t think Steam technically even supports them). Server performance is something we hope to work on and improve. The problems probably aren’t apparent when you join a freshly made server.. but once the server has about 50,000+ structures it will start to get laggy – and we’ll start to see periods of unresponsiveness. We’re going to have to put some tools together to catch and log these hitches and hopefully get them fixed. Linux & Mac Getting Linux and Mac working just as well as their PC versions is another one of our top priorities. It’s important to realize that because we’re using Unity our hands are tied in a lot of ways here. If something runs great on Windows, but runs like crap on Linux – our options are pretty limited because all the workings are on Unity’s side of the engine. In fact most of the time our best and only option is to turn that feature off on that platform. This isn’t a great solution because you don’t want to play a game with crippled graphics. Mac users account for around 3% of our purchases and 2% of our online players. To us that means that 33% of those players either can’t start the game or aren’t enjoying the performance of it. We’re aware that some mac users can’t play the game and this is one of our top priorities. Linux users account for 0.4% of our sales and 0.2% of our online players. Similarly to Mac, we’re losing half the users somewhere – we have work to do here. Defending Yourself Defense is something we talk about a lot internally. We have a lot of offense.. weapons, grenades, explosives. The only defense we have right now are doors and spikey fence. It’s obvious that there’s a gap here that needs filling. Especially when defending unoccupied homes. When developing this gap we need to keep in mind that people are crafty and will find a way to work around it. They’ll build stairs over a fence. They’ll put a sleeping bag outside the base so when they die they can respawn there, pick up their weapons and carry on. We want to avoid adding systems to dissuade these types of behavior. If anything they should be rewarded – because they’re finding their own solutions to problems. We want to find solutions that allow the defending players to find innovative solutions to attacks. Ideally solutions that don’t involve putting a million doors in your house, or building a maze around it. Playing with Friends One of the most requested features, with 575 votes on trello is shared door access. This is a no brainer for us and reveals that people really want to play with their friends. They want their friends to share their house. They want to work with their friends to defend their house. Helping people to find, recognize and work with their friends is something we try to weigh into every decision we make. For example – if you and a friend are building a house together.. who controls the house? Should just the builder of a wall be able to rip it down easily – or all of his friends too? If we help people cooperate better – maybe there will be less murders. Removing Zombies Helk was meant to remove Zombies before we released on Steam. That never happened. The sooner we remove them the less people will miss them. We don’t know whether we’re actually going to have to replace them further down the line. It’s not something we want to rush into. Reskinning them so they’re ‘mutants’ instead of ‘zombies’ goes against the whole point of removing them in the first place (which is: we’re not a dayz clone anymore). Console Release A console release isn’t out of the question. But it’s not something we’re going to be dedicating lots of time to right now. Player Customization We skipped this completely on the first run at the player model because we just wanted something that worked. Customizable faces, beards, hair is something we’re in early talks about. It’s not as huge priority as other stuff on this list – but it’s something we’re basing decisions on.",

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/01/10/rust-alpha-review/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rust alpha review\"> </a> Written by Andy Chalk My first day on the island did not go well. Waking after some unknown calamity, it was only a few minutes before I stumbled upon a man-made structure and encountered its owner, working diligently to expand and improve his home. He was somewhat less pleased to see me, however, than I was to meet him. \"Leave or I kill,\" he said, four short words I failed to take sufficiently seriously, and a few seconds later he hit me in the face with a hatchet, and then again, and I was dead. That s life and death in Rust, an open-world survival game that falls somewhere between DayZ and Minecraft and has a way of bringing out both the best and the worst in its players. A babe in the woods Rust's only goal is to survive, and it s always challenging. You begin with nothing but a rock, a torch, and a couple of bandages, and if you try to spend more than two nights out in the open in that condition, you will die. It's an intimidating, sink-or-swim introduction to the game, but Rust isn't a forgiving experience. Most of the game world will do its best to kill you and while epic multiplayer battles are rare, ambush murders are not. Nor are you particularly durable, unlike conventional videogame characters, and if somebody puts a few bullets in you, you will die. Yet that fragility, coupled with the near-absolute freedom offered by an open-world, no-rules arena, is exactly what makes it work. \"Go forth and do whatever the hell you want\" is exhilarating. The player-built Fortress of Corrugated Metal There's a primal thrill to running through the jungle like some latter-day Tarzan, but if you're serious about staying alive then sooner or later you'll want to build some form of shelter. Construction options are quite limited so you won't be erecting any great architectural masterpieces, but having a relatively safe place to crash and store your stuff can extend your lifespan dramatically. Crafting is an even more important component of the game and while it's likewise neither particularly interesting nor flexible at this early stage of development, better equipment is the key to survival. The transition from prey to predator can be tedious, but once you're packing heat (and pants), the real fun begins. The conventional fauna is bad enough, but there are also deadly zombies and radioactive hotspots that give the game a faint whiff of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Worst of all are your fellow players, who ensure that no matter how powerful you are, you're never entirely free of danger. At one point, well-armed and equipped after several hours, I was hunting zombies near some radioactive fuel tanks. Quick double-taps from my MP5 dispatched them and I was starting to feel like a real badass, which is probably why I wasn't paying as much attention to my surroundings as I should have been while my attention was occupied by the inventory of my latest undead victim, a pair of bandits snuck up from behind and creamed me with a shotgun. I've come a long way from swinging a rock. That's not to say that everyone you meet is a paranoid, kill-or-be-killed social Darwinist, and in fact there's a considerable degree of cooperation to be found in some locales. But it comes cautiously, while vicious, violent death lurks everywhere. There are non-PvP servers for those who prefer less capriciously lethal entertainment, but while that cuts down on griefers, it also does away with one of the most undeniably exciting parts of the game: Random encounters with other human beings in which anything can happen. As frustrating as it is to be blown away without warning, that pervasive uncertainty is a central part of the survival experience, and Rust is vastly diminished without it. It's not too soon The Rust alpha test is available via Steam Early Access, and as you'd expect it's very much a work in progress. The graphics are no great shakes and you can expect wonky shadows, occasional clipping errors, and other glitches, and the sound effects don't even pretend to venture beyond minimal. Lag is sometimes a challenge, especially when you find yourself caught up in a spot of unpleasantness with your fellow island inhabitants, and simply finding someplace to play can be a hassle: Official servers tend to be crowded, while unofficial ones can be unreliable. Server wipes happen with major updates, so it's best not to get too attached to your stuff, and there are plenty of gameplay oddities: for instance, every animal you kill, from boars to bears, provides \"chicken breasts\" for food. (I haven't found any chickens in the game.) Mmm, chicken. Rust s alpha is rough, but it's surprisingly playable. The underlying systems are essentially complete and functional (or at least appear to be, from an outside-looking-in perspective) and recent updates have dramatically improved the performance of the server browser. Rust has a ton of potential, and it's an intense and impressive experience even now. Price: $20 Release date: Out now via Steam Early Access Developer: Facepunch Studios Multiplayer: Server dependent, typically 128 Link: http://www.playrust.com/ Play it on: Dual-core CPU, 8GB RAM, DirectX 9.0c video card Alternatively: DayZ Verdict: Fun to play now &nbsp; An intense, take-no-prisoners survival game, Rust is a great use of Steam Early Access. It's far from finished, but it's ready to play. This review is based on the current alpha build of the game. We will re-review this game once it is complete.",

        "contents": "<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/01/08/rust-interview/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Garry Newman interview: on Rust and player freedom &#8220;we give them the tools, they make the world&#8221;\"> </a> Rust has been causing a bit of a stir on Steam Early Access this week. The open world, player-driven survival game is made by Facepunch Studios, which includes the designer behind Garry's mod, Garry Newman. Players are free to hunt, gather and craft their own structures, choosing their own alliances and enemies in a bleak post apocalyptic environment. How is everyone getting along? What are the best player builds Facepunch have seen so far? We asked Garry, and you'll find his answers below. PC Gamer: What's the grand concept behind Rust? Why did you want to make it? Garry: We love DayZ and we wanted to make a game like it. So we did. We quickly realized that we couldn't create an explorable world as well done as DayZ so we came up with the idea of having the player create the world. This was the seed that spawned Rust. We really loved the idea of players starting with nothing, and having no goals but to exist in the world. Every decision we make is pushing emergent gameplay. So the players themselves decide how the games are made. We give them the tools, they make the world. For example.. a problem we had was that users wanted to be able to open each others doors. The solution suggested was to have a list of users that you can add to a door - to let your friends use them. That's great but it doesn't happen in real life. It's too secure. It's not exploitable. So what if the door has a combination that you share with friends. Or a key, that you make copies of and give to friends. This solves the problem but it leaves a lot of room for emergent gameplay. You could build a house and hide the key somewhere in the world for another player at a later time. You could be forced to hand over your key at gunpoint, and be locked out of your own house etc. PC Gamer: It's an incredibly ruthless game, and players often kill on sight. Do you have any plans to counter this, or do you see it as part of the experience? Garry: So one thing that was suggested was making 'bandits'. Making people turn evil, get a negative score if they attack other players. We hate that. People should be nice to each other because they get a nice feeling from being nice. There shouldn't be a system hanging around forcing people to be good. It removes a lot of gameplay fun. One of the things we did that made a huge difference here unexpectedly was add voice chat. A lot of the time players attack each other out of fear. They don't want to be the person to die. Being able to talk to the other guy and feel them out that way makes a huge difference. There's a lot of this 'tweaking' we can do, kind of social engineering to make people more comfortable with each other. PC Gamer: There are a lot of permadeath/survival games around at the moment. What do you think sets Rust apart from the competition? Garry: To be totally honest we haven't played any of the others. With Rust we're making the game we want to play. We're being ruthless with the development, being careful to test each theory instead of just dismissing it as a bad idea. We're handling the building, cooking, crafting stuff pretty well I think. To the point where I think it's convinced some of the bigger boys to add it to their games too. The fact that we can influence those that inspired us is proof enough that we're doing something right. PC Gamer: Have players done anything in the game that has impressed you? Garry: Hah - every time another player comes up to me in game and doesn't bash me to death with a rock I'm impressed. There's a lot of building that's impressed us. There's a lot of rival gangs stuff... that actually causes a lot of problems for us, because they get too powerful and consume all the resources on the map. We need to look at ways to balancing that. PC Gamer: There's lots of stories of players imprisoning other players and having fun with them. Garry: During early development we accidentally left a small white static cube out miles away from anywhere. There was a French server we joined and they'd built a huge shrine around it in a big circle, like a crop circle. Helk tells a story about one time he was talking to a new bunch of players and showing them the ropes, said good luck then he went to bed, expecting them to die within the next 10 minutes and then hate the game and never come back. When he went on next they'd played through the entire night, had got all sorts of weapons and built a huge fortress. PC Gamer: What kind of player behaviour have you noticed emerging? Any kinds of play styles that have surprised you? Garry: It's a weird thing. When any player can kill you easily - and they don't, it's like the biggest compliment ever. They become good friends. You go to bed, and lie there and think to yourself \"that was a nice guy, I hope I run into him again.\" It's a very weird feeling to be having in a game. I mean, people help each other out in TF2 all the time. A medic tops you up, but you don't feel a closeness to them. I guess it's because the world is so harsh you kind of feel closer to people that are kind. It must be an in-born reaction or something. PC Gamer: How much impact does the community have on the ongoing development of the game? Garry: It has a huge impact. It's a double edged sword. Some people get a lot of stuff wrong, in their suggestions and ideas.. and they get angry at us for doing things differently. They say we're going to ruin the game and stuff. Which I don't know.. Don't they think they know what we're doing? Why would we want to make our game worse? They don't really understand what the game is about and don't really trust us to take it in the right direction. But then there's a huge group that instantly get what we're trying to do. They get that we want to do things different. They understand why the game has to be harsh, why we can't add reputation points. And they make awesome suggestions that we'd never even thought of. Sometimes we'll have a problem and we'll have 5 solutions, but we know in our guts that none of them are perfect, they compromise what we're doing and they're going to cause more and more comprises down the line.

DayZ managed to fend off its competition throughout the Christmas sale: staying in the top spot throughout the event, all while avoiding the discount infection. It sold 875,000 copies in three weeks, and has now found a survival buddy in the shape of Rust. The alpha survival game from Garry Newman and Facepunch Studios is securely in second place on the Steam chart, and has itself sold 150,000 copies in the first two weeks. So what's the appeal of the game? To find out, Rust player and YouTube videographer Argyle Alligator started interviewing other players inside of the game. Their responses weave a tale of rocks, headshots and hilarity.",

A few issues have popped up relating to the net code that we are looking into and hope to fix immediately, From time to time you may experience what the community is calling ‘ghosting’ where you are unable to loot items and everyone else sees your player in one spot. For now you can just disconnect and reconnect to fix it until we solve the problem. A little note : Facepunch Official #1 (Dev) is now called Germany 1 Facepunch Official #2 is now called Germany 2 Thanks for playing! We will keep everyone informed as we make progress on these issues.",
