Roll cooldown reduced from 5s -> 4.25s Roll cooldown now starts when the roll ends Distant Savior Number Adjustments Level 1: 20% faster revive time Level 2: 30% faster revive time Level 3: 40% faster revive time Leave No Trace rework Players without the perk will leave footsteps always, whether crouching, walking, or sprinting. Crouching with this perk equipped for 0.25s will make all existing footsteps quickly disappear Level 1: no footsteps while crouching Level 2: no footsteps while walking Level 3: no footsteps ever This does not change audio cues, only visual footprints. Developer note: No Trace wasn't very useful before. This should make it viable to run, and the other adjustments should increase the risk associated with not running it. Shadow Walker number adjustments Level 1: 50% faster crouch move speed Level 2: 75% faster crouch move speed Level 3: 100% faster crouch move speed Think Fast rework Now reduces the number of rounds on the Reflex puzzle Level 1: 2 fewer rounds Level 2: 4 fewer rounds Level 3: 6 fewer rounds Developer note: the Reflex puzzle was very fast to complete, and the old Think Fast perk wasn't very strong. Increasing the required rounds to 16, and reworking a perk to allow players to effectively revert the puzzle to its pre-patch numbers, should increase the difficulty while increasing the viability of running this perk. No Pack Grabpacks can be repaired instantly, and survivors get UI showing who needs their grabpack fixed Level 1: Sabotage lasts 5 seconds Level 2: Sabotage lasts 10 seconds Level 3: Sabotage lasts 15 seconds Developer note: No Pack wasn't very fun to play against, and repairing took way too long to be worth it. This change hopefully reduces some frustration surrounding this sabotage, while increasing the skill required to use it effectively. Cosmetics Added Shamrock Survivor Skin Leprechaun Outfit Leprechaun Beard Lady Luck Mommy Skin Lucky Hands Pot of Gold Grabpack Fingers Crossed Gesture Improved Items in store can now be previewed before purchasing All hair items are now colorable Added equip animations Updated ponytail hair model to match style of other hair cosmetics UI Added In-game Scoreboard for Survivors See how your teammates are doing, what perks they have, and more Indicator for players who need their grabpack repaired during the No Pack sabotage Added setting for Grabpack volume Improved Improved perk selection screen user flow Displays all 3 perk slots clearly Allows for un-equipping perks Improved style of various texts throughout the game Reduced Result Screen time from 30s -> 15s Added more variants for overall result of match Bug Fixes Fixed camera clipping when carried by monster Fixed floating hands in the lobby Fixed potential crash related to music switching Fixed some clipping with Princess Dress Fixed survivors being able to enter lockers while No Escape sabotage is active Fixed Spanish not appearing as a localization option Fixed invalid sessions sometimes appearing in server browser Fixed wrong character showing up in customize menu Fixed invisible one-way audio walls in Theater and Factory Fixed Genius perk not doing anything Fixed visibility issues with footprints Updated Credits Fixed Limit FPS not working as expected Fixed ticket reward inconsistencies Fixed lobby music playing in tutorial Various fixes for jumpscare reliability Fixed pressing \"Enter\" as monster locking movement for 5 seconds Fixed \"repair puzzles\" indicator not showing for monsters Fixed not being able to wear masks with ponytail equipped Fixed lighting and normals on many cosmetics Fixed default survivor skin UVs Booby Trap Sabotage activation now properly notifies monster of location of sabotage Fixed various UI masking issues ",

This patch provides the framework for that, and allows us to monitor any bugs we might have with the host migration system. Minor changes & bugfixes: - Fixed jumpscare animation while entering locker - Added Cardboard boxy sounds - Added character turntable on customization screen - Toy part deposit nav indicator distance now represented by opacity - Fixed mouse going out of viewport - Fixed mommy's spotter ability not ending - Fixed lobby UI being stuck on players' screens - Fixed some soft-locks and exploitable areas in the toy factory and theater maps - Fixed bug where wuggies could kill player in tutorial - Fixed toy parts being dropped out-of-bounds when a player is jumpscared ",
