        "contents": "Hey everyone! There's been a lot of talk about 6v6 lately, and it's only intensified in recent weeks since we posted our latest Director's Take and made a Twitter post with a promise to talk about it in the future. Well, now is the future, and this is that next piece! So, let's get into it! Wait. Let's not get into it quite yet… This is a pretty complex and nuanced topic, and it gets to the beating heart of what makes this game tick. Our players have different opinions and preferences about the ideal number of players in an Overwatch match, and so does our team. We’re a microcosm of the broader community and discuss this internally. I’m hoping that this piece will serve as an introduction to our own discussions and a jumping off point to engage with all of you! I'd also like to set a few expectations and ground rules. First, it's pretty long (creators are going to lose their voices reading this one aloud). If you'd like a tl;dr, the 'What's Next' section should suffice. Secondly, I'm not here to tell you what you ought to like, or even what's empirically better. This is a game, and your preference for fun is relative to your own tastes, ability and experience. Lastly, there are years of decisions that affect such a fundamental piece of Overwatch. Some of you might be intimately aware of these, while others might not. Before diving in, I'd like to set the stage and give some context on some of the larger changes to the game that ultimately culminated in the 5v5 format we have today. Historical Context There have been three large format changes to Overwatch, and the first happened shortly after the game launched. This was Hero Limits. Before this there could be any number of a particular hero on one team. You could have six Genji’s, or six Reinhardt’s. If my memory serves me right, the winner of Team 4's first internal tournament was one Winston and five Zenyatta’s. We called it ‘Quinston’. Zenyatta Orbs stacked with no cap to healing at the time. It was glorious... and terrifying! During early development it was necessary to have duplicate heroes per team. Our first core combat milestone only had four heroes. As the roster grew this was no longer necessary and it also introduced issues. Overwatch heroes have very distinct kits with impactful abilities. Stacking abilities could be fun, but it posed challenges to balancing many of those abilities in game. People reference double barrier, but back then you could have six. Imagine cycling six Immortality Fields! The number of team compositions and strategies available was huge. The variety was great, but we didn't feel like we could ever truly balance the game without severely watering down our heroes, so we made the choice to impose a limit of one of each hero per team. This essentially solved the issue of ability stacking, but it did have a few side effects. It traded some of the creativity in putting together team compositions for a more consistent and balanced experience. It also took away some choice from players. If someone wanted to play Tracer, but you were already Tracer, they would be unable to. A theme of this, and future decisions, was limiting match variety as well as player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players. Remember this point, because we’ll touch on it a few more times in this piece. I think the hero limit rule was a great decision, and we would make it again. The other two large format changes have a lot of positive benefits but are not as clear cut. The second large change to the game's format was the move from ‘Open Queue’ to ‘Role Queue’, which limited team compositions to two heroes from each role. Before Role Queue, there was no enforced 2-2-2 team composition, and players had the freedom to select any role they liked once they loaded into a match. With Open Queue, teams had a lot of freedom of choice about what heroes and team compositions to play, but there were quite a few problems that Role Queue intended to address. Prior to implementing role queue, there was a stark imbalance in the number of people playing each role within each match. Damage was, by far (and still is today), the most popular role and tank was, by far, the least popular. In fact, seeing matches with five or even six Damage players on each team was not uncommon. This role imbalance frequently led to wildly imbalanced matches between teams. The game played better when heroes from all 3 roles were selected. The disparity caused social issues as players would try to pressure others into playing tank or support roles, even if they didn’t want to. It made balancing heroes more difficult, since we couldn't balance around a certain role ratio for each team. And it even made introducing new heroes more difficult, since any new hero kit had to take into consideration hundreds of different team compositions and abilities that could overlap with it. The move to a Role Queue format was aimed to mitigate these challenges. Moving to Role Queue solved many of these problems and added some additional benefits to the game as well. With Role Queue in place, matchmaking is based on skill within a given role, not just skill overall. Some players have wildly different skill ratings per role, so the ability to matchmake around set roles provides a big, measurable boost in match quality. Role Queue also solidified the identity of each role, and the fantasy of doing that role’s ‘job’ became clearer. However, the switch to the Role Queue system did have some downsides, the largest of which was much longer queue times. Prior to Role Queue, the matchmaker just needed to find 12 players of similar skill levels in order to put matches together. After Role Queue, it needed to find four players of each role to make a match. The total number of players queuing has no effect on this, it’s almost solely governed by the ratio of people queuing for the least popular role. Given the games’ lower relative ratio of players queueing for Tank than other Damage and Support roles, queue times went way up.  We’ll go into details on this later. The team tried to address this imbalance in various ways. We introduced a priority pass system that gave players who played low demand roles (Tank) a shorter queue when they switched to Damage. This had a positive effect for several weeks, but its influence quickly faded. We also introduced systems to reward players for playing Tank, eventually giving them a loot box and a bunch of XP for queuing for that role. None of these were able to put a dent in the demand for playing DPS. Damage queue times drifted a bit lower over time, but much of this was due to the introduction of Open Queue Competitive, and the permanent loss of Damage players unwilling to wait that long for a match. There were additional drawbacks with Role Queue. I mentioned earlier that many of our decisions made improvements to the game at the cost of match variety and player freedom. Team compositions were now locked to 2-2-2. This was another step to a more consistent experience within Overwatch, but sometimes consistency can start to feel ‘samey.’ There were some pretty exciting metas in the pre-Role Queue world and swapping to a hero of a different role mid-match was often a much bigger change (and more exciting!) than swapping to one of the same role. Like Hero Limits, Role Queue took away a part of the freedom in selecting heroes that served as the base of Overwatch, but I often wonder if the success of it is as cut and dry as that of Hero Limits. Could there be an in-between version that softens the original problems without completely solving them, and also isn’t quite as restrictive as our current Role Queue system? A bit more on that later. The third, major format change These challenges, as well as longer queue times, lead us to the third and most recent major format change to the game— the shift from 6v6 to 5v5. This is almost a blog within a blog, but we’re going to cover three things: Why we switched to 5v5 Queue times after the switch to 5v5 What the team thinks about 6v6 Here we go. Why we switched to 5v5 There were many reasons behind the transition to 5v5. When we launched Overwatch 2, we talked about the greater individual agency that players could have in 5v5. Overwatch is a team sport, and it requires players to rely on each other to be successful. This was even more the case previously and the game could be frustrating if your team was out of sync. Many times, fights in 6v6 couldn’t resolve until ultimate abilities came online. Correct that, until ultimate combos could be executed to break through two tanks worth of mitigation supported by high, uncontested healing output. The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs, but reaaaally low, lows. One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments. Overwatch 2 also has a greater emphasis on FPS gameplay. There’s less damage mitigation and CC, and players get to shoot at enemies more. Crowd Control could take players out of the game for extended periods of time, especially when they were chained back-to-back. A five second Sombra Hack, Mei Freeze on her primary fire, Brig Bash, Ana Sleep, Orisa Halt and Sigma Rock could all happen consecutively to one player! Typically, a Tank who could often survive this onslaught… at least in game, their real-life mental health was another story.  Damage heroes often complained that their role was the least impactful relative to the strength of super powerful Tank synergies and Support heroes undoing their playmaking. The emphasis on ability cooldown management, ult tracking, shooting barriers instead of players, and not big enough timing windows to just shoot enemies and get eliminations were all factors that contributed to this feeling. Support heroes also had to focus almost exclusively on healing since there were bigger team health pools and more incoming damage on the field with the additional Tank player. In 5v5 they have more agency to add some damage or duel other heroes. Tank synergy wasn’t always fun. It slowed the game down, and stabilized it, but sometimes it absolutely ground it to a halt. People point to the double shield meta as an example of this. It wasn’t just about double shields, though. The ability to stack a very defense heavy lineup, especially in game modes that required a team to push through a small choke, caused a lot of matches to feel like there was no progress at all. The game is faster now, and it doesn’t typically stall out. It feels like there is more room to move around a map without the need to earn every inch of it. In 5v5 fights are often less focused on moving around in a death ball formation and there is more room to take angles, flank, and duel other players, which brings in more of that FPS gameplay. While 6v6 can have high moments, it's also hard to follow. Tracking nine other players is easier than eleven. There are fewer visual effects on screen, especially during big team fights. Overwatch is a pretty demanding game and moving to 5v5 made it a bit more cognitively manageable. Lastly, one of the biggest benefits of 5v5 was dramatically reduced queue times. Let’s explore that. Queue time data and context The chart below shows Ranked Play queue times per role after the introduction of Role Queue to Overwatch in 2019, compared to queue times per role in Overwatch 2’s 5v5 Role Queue format. As you can see, the shift to 5v5 Role Queue dramatically reduced queue times for players in all roles, and most notably the Damage role (which is the most popular role). {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/7273fa06c6041e0bb3266a9dfd86691fd06c7827.png The biggest factor driving the difference between Overwatch and Overwatch 2 queue times is the ratio of players queueing for each role. We hear players speculate that long queue times are a result of not enough players playing Overwatch – that isn’t the case -- but instead that relative to the other roles, players generally queue tank less, leading to longer wait times for all while we wait for a Tank to free up to find a proper match. So, in practice, the actual ratio of players queueing for Tank, Damage and Support is much closer to the current 1-2-2 format than the previous 2-2-2 format. As a result, the 5v5 Role Queue format better mirrors actual player interest in each role, and making the switch resulted in shorter queues. The sharp drop-off in queue times in October of 2022 is when Overwatch 2, along with 5v5, shipped. The queue times of all heroes dropped and are now much shorter than they were in the 6v6 world. This is almost all because the game required one less Tank in a match. If you look at the current queue times you can see that there is still a lack of Tanks compared to our other roles. Just ‘flipping the switch’ and returning to 6v6 would likely cause a return to previous queue times or worse. Regardless of the amount of players in-game, queue times are always reflective of how many people are queued per role. In other words, the main driver of increased queue times is the ratio of players queued in each role. Since there are less players queuing as Tanks, queues would likely go back to the way they were before.   Thoughts on 6v6 The game started its life with six players on each team. I discussed why we moved away from 6v6, but that doesn’t mean it’s without any merit. There were moments and madness that could happen with twelve players in a match that just don't quite coalesce when there are ten. It was almost too much to keep track of. Correction, it was too much to keep track of at times, but that was part of the charm! There are big moments in Overwatch 2, but they don't quite have that same chaotic, over-the-top feeling to them. Part of that chaos allowed players to feel less pressure in a match. There was an extra player to take up a bit of the slack for someone that was performing poorly. And since that player was a tank, they had quite a bit of impact. There were a lot more hit points and defensive capabilities to burn through, which had a stabilizing effect on gameplay. Teams would fold a bit slower than they do now. We went over some of the issues of tank synergy earlier but having two of them allowed one to focus on protecting their backline while the other held ground or pushed into the enemy team. The tank role had a lot of depth in understanding how to work with the other tank on the team. This part of the mastery curve took a long time to learn, and for the small group of people devoted to it, that was part of its allure. We mentioned the difficulty in balancing tanks for 6v6 earlier, but the past year and a half has shown us that there are issues with balancing Tanks for 5v5 as well. For much of OW2 Tanks have been fairly balanced, but when one of them becomes a powerful outlier, like Mauga, that can be felt strongly in the world of one Tank. What's Next Ok! That was a lot of setup. I think I've put more effort into this than any essay I wrote in college! So where do we go from here? At the end of the day, we want to make the game that players want to play. Because of the challenges mentioned previously we are focused on making 5v5 the best experience that it can be. However, because we operate as a service to our players, we always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback, to give you the best game experience we can.  Rather than introduce a disruptive, permanent change to the game, we'd prefer to explore the space further and make changes based on that exploration. With that said, we're looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in Overwatch 2. The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test. Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results. This is taking some time, however, for reasons that may not be readily apparent. The first, and honestly largest, reason is the need to do this in a way that allows the game to have optimized technical performance (I’m referring to framerate and memory constraints) with 12 players in a match. There have been quite a few upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 that have an impact on the performance of the game. These range from new features like allied outlines and enabling healer vision by default, the addition of more technically demanding hero kits, as well as visual upgrades to UI, heroes and maps. In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can have significant impacts for our players, causing the game to underperform on older systems. Overwatch is a fast-paced game, and maintaining a game that runs smoothly across all our platforms is important for the player’s experience. While a limited time test could arrive sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently increase performance across the game. This would be a large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish. Another issue, and one that still gives me anxiety about opening this Pandora’s Box, is what to do with queue times if enough players prefer 6v6 to keep some form of it around. The team was not able to solve this issue previously. While we have some ideas now, there’s no guarantee that they will work. Is there a world where people are willing to live with long queue times to play this format? Maybe, but that’s a pretty risky move to make. We also have tens of millions of new players that have only played 5v5. We want to be openly mindful not to frustrate those who like the game as it is today. The outcome of these tests would give us a lot of valuable information to consider moving forward. We’d run the test for a few weeks and gauge interest from the community. Then we’d measure the impact it had on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, Arcade, etc. We’d take the lessons from this playtest to see what we can learn about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of Overwatch. We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for. Whether that’s a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out. I’m going to jump on a soap box for a moment. When you look at the changes to Overwatch since its inception, it’s clear that many of those have reduced some of the variety within an Overwatch match. We get feedback from some players that Overwatch can feel “the same” from game to game. While much of this gets attributed to 5v5, we feel that there is more at play here. Besides running experiments with 6v6, we’d like to run some that re-examine the ways we tried solving previous problems, specifically with the goal of bringing some of the freedom back to an Overwatch match without the severity of issues that accompanied it. For instance, we think there could be other ways of putting a team together that aren’t quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue. We’ll be running at least one Quick Play: Hacked based on this idea in Season 13. There are some gotchas to this direction, but after reading 400 pages of this blog, I hope you’re all able to see that there are trade-offs to many of the decisions that go into this game (and into any game, really). To Wrap It Up… For Now Your feedback has driven both our inspiration and commitment to testing new ideas in-game. We want to be super thoughtful about how we implement new ideas into the live game because there are millions of players who jump into Overwatch each season, and we want anything we put in-game to benefit the community as a whole. Ultimately, the Overwatch team wants to continue building the game that you want to play season after season. This blog (or thesis, rather) is just the start of this conversation. This isn’t the last time we’re going to be getting into 5v5 or 6v6, and we can’t wait to share more about our plans in the future. In closing, we appreciate you so much, and we love seeing your passion and dedication to the game, Team 4, and the Overwatch community. The team hears you, we see you, and we’re incredibly thankful to be on this ride with all of you. Can’t wait to share more in the upcoming months, and let’s make a great game, together.  - Aaron Keller ",

        "contents": "Now you can burn through the competition with the Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin, available in the Mythic Shop. A first of its kind, the Bound Demon Mythic Weapon Skin comes alive as you battle through the front lines. Burning in the blackened steel of an ancient hammer, this Bound Demon awaits a powerful warrior to wield its might. Whether charging into battle or holding the line with every swing, the Mythic Bound Demon Reinhardt Weapon Skin will react to your every attack. Some of the Overwatch 2 designers that helped forged this fiery weapon shared with us a bit of the process taking it from concept to modeling, to rigging and animation, and finally to the incredible visual effects that you’ll see in your games. What were your goals when creating the concept for the Bound Demon Mythic Weapon? Angela Song (Concept Artist): Our initial thought was to have the theme be magma, but once I started concepting, I decided to add a creature to make the weapon fiery and alive. Eventually we landed on Bound Demon, a cursed axe that glows with hellfire. The reactivity of the weapon echoes the demonic entity awakening and gaining power as you feed it more kills throughout the game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/205155abfe9023a0f84d660ee4aa1a00dd2e357d.png When it comes to the 3D modeling, how much work did it take to get the look of the weapon just right? Ryan Savas (Senior Hard Surface Artist): On the 3D modeling side, it was a constant back-and-forth between Tech Art, Animation, Concept, and VFX. We iterated a lot on how to make the weapon feel just as cool for the player as it does for their opponent, and seeing it come together week after week was incredible. Each team was trying to maximize the awesomeness of this axe from the second they caught wind of it, and it was amazing to be part of that experience. Seeing a model I made become a roaring inferno of magma and fire was incredible. The team really knows how to breathe life into everything we make! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/e8d335cd5ffbde41e3509e15f99956cdd73c732e.png Rein’s Mythic weapon has a fun weapon flourish animation that comes with the Reload. What was it like to build that into Reinhardt’s first-person view? Angela: For the flourish, we wanted a smooth animation that the player can constantly spam. Reinhardt jovially tossing and flipping the weapon felt like a natural fit. It suits his personality and encourages the player to spam it. Ana Martinez (Tech Artist): Tech art worked closely with the team to make a unique weapon setup for the animators to do their magic. We wanted to give the animation team the liberty to make the weapon roar, twist, and smirk as Reinhardt swings it around in a blazing inferno. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/420915a25e55420416b92ec99371236f47bb9713.png One of the features players can unlock is the visual effect that erupts in flames. What was it like designing this? Angela: The kill effect is fast but impactful. When I was concepting the weapon, I wanted it to feel like there was a lava explosion every time the player killed an enemy, like watching an eruption. Nick Quackenbush (Associate VFX Artist): I moved forward with the idea that the kill effect is a smoldering eruption, like the player is calling upon the demonic powers below the earth to finish off his wounded foes, sacrificing them and feeding the power to Bound Demon's endless hunger. Pick up the Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin now available in the Mythic Shop today. Unlock the base skin for 50 Mythic Shards and then unlock up to three levels of effects including weapon flourish, elimination effects, and reactive effects to unleash the demon on the battlefield. For a limited time, you can also unlock the Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin Bundle which instantly unlocks the base Mythic Weapon, along with 2,000 Overwatch Coins and 20 Battle Pass Tier skips. The Battlefield will be ablaze when you wield the Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon in your games! ",

        "contents": "Hey everyone! It's been a bit since our last Director's Take. We’ve missed a few of these in recent months. Sorry for the gap, speaking to all of you will continue to be a priority for the team. Let's talk about tanks. Let me rephrase that… a lot of you are talking about tanks, I'd like to contribute from a developer point of view. We've heard from players that the tank role is in a tough spot right now and has been since Season 8 ended. We agree. That's not to say that tanks were in a perfect spot before Season 9, but the problem now is that most of them just don't feel as 'tanky' as they should. Many times, both Support heroes need to focus solely on the tank just to keep them alive. In this scenario both the Tank and Supports can feel like they have limited options in their gameplay, as they are essentially tied to each other. Our internal stats show this as well. We've come up with a new metric since Season 9 that we simply call \"tankiness.\" It's roughly the number of deaths a hero experiences compared to how many deaths they ought to experience. There are a lot of stats that go into determining what an expected death is, and I’m not able to go into that level of detail here. The point is that your experience and our data are aligned. Since Season 9 almost all heroes in the game have become less tanky. This isn't all unintended. One of the issues we were addressing at the time was the sheer amount of burst damage and healing available. However, most tanks (excluding Ball, who is roughly the same) moved a lot further than heroes in other roles. Recent changes, like the headshot damage reduction on tanks, had some effect on this, but it’s still under where we'd like it to be. We still like many of the game wide changes that were implemented over the last few seasons - the projectile size increase, the headshot damage and knockback reduction on tanks, and the passive health regeneration on all heroes. However, what we’re currently discussing is whether the path forward from here should be centered around broad, systemic changes, or per hero changes. We’re discussing limited versions of the former, for instance we’re looking at reduced versions of the Damage role passive. However, we’d like to do more of the latter. Individual buffs or nerfs to heroes can have a dramatic impact on their effectiveness compared to a broad change that targets all heroes or a role. Additionally, it further reinforces the differences between heroes. For example, one of the reasons Reinhardt ought to feel tanky is through his shield. How does this relate to tanks? We’re putting together a patch that is targeted at increasing the tankiness of many of these heroes, but we’re doing it through individual changes to each of them. Ideally these changes would build on a hero’s fantasy. Increasing the health of Reinhardt’s shield is a good example of accomplishing both of those goals. This is a priority for our balance team, and right now we’re targeting either mid-Season 11 or Season 12. We’ll have more details on some of the changes to expect and more concrete timing soon. This touches on some discussions we’ve been having about balance philosophy in general. Balance in the game is very nuanced and doesn’t just depend on the total power level or win rate of a hero. We look at pick rate, skill tier, region and platform, not to mention a myriad of other individual stats like the amount of damage, deaths, and kills heroes have. On top of stats, design goals and community perception also guide our decisions. Some of the recent metas have brought into question the different ways we look at balancing heroes that could be considered niche. There are heroes that the community is ok with having both a high win rate and a high pick rate. When Reinhardt hits a 60% win rate, which is considered very high for us, and is played often there are few complaints. When a hero like Roadhog does this (he recently topped out at around 54%), the community reacts… differently. There are heroes that the community deems more ‘fair,’ or at least less frustrating, than others. The mechanics of some heroes, especially at really high levels of play, require us to pay more attention to them. We still want every hero to be competitively viable, and we love that some of our heroes can be the right situational pick, but we think it’s healthier for the game for us to proactively, and in a more timely manner, manage certain heroes and prevent them from dominating. In that vein, where is balance in the first few days of Season 11? On the tank side there is no standout winner with D.Va, Sigma, Winston, Junker Queen, Reinhardt and Zarya in the upper half. Their win rates are between 50-55%. With Damage, Pharah continues to excel at around 58%. Reaper (at 55%) and Mei (at 50%) have risen and Sojourn has dramatically fallen (around 44%). And Supports are relatively stable with Illari being the biggest mover, rising a few percentage points to 55%. That’s it for this week. We should have another Director’s Take out in a few weeks' time. Until then, have an amazing Season 11 and let’s make a great game!",

Competitive Play Updates Rank Percentage is now displayed on the Competitive Progress page allowing you to check your exact percentage without playing another match. Renamed the Modifiers “Win Streak” and “Loss Streak” to “Win Trend” and “Loss Trend” to more accurately convey that these modifiers are calculated by weighing the most recent games more heavily, but that they are not true streaks. Added more parameters for how the matchmaker handles wide groups, so that it can ensure better queue times. A button that allows you to view the match’s final Scoreboard has been added to each page during the end-of-game flow. Hero Updates General Knockdown time when two charging abilities collide reduced from 2 to 1.7 seconds. Developer Comments: This stun time reduction applies to the knockdown that happens when two charging abilities collide and result in a tie (with Reinhardt, Doomfist, Brigitte, Mauga, Bob). The counterplay and interaction of two charging abilities impacting each other is great, but it took both players out of the fight a little too long. Tank D.Va Boosters Impact damage increased from 15 to 25. Fusion Cannons Weapon spread reduced from 3.75 to 3.375 degrees. Developer Comments: These changes will improve D.Va’s effectiveness against smaller targets as she became less effective against armored enemies in the previous patch. Junker Queen Rampage Startup time reduced from 0.75 to 0.5 seconds. Jagged Blade Now pulls tanks further. Developer Comments: The Tank knockback resistance passive was affecting Junker Queen’s pull effect more than intended. The distance can be affected by their movement, but Tanks are now pulled in about 5-6 meters instead of only 3 meters or so. Orisa Javelin Spin Cooldown reduced from 9 to 8 seconds. Developer Comments: Orisa’s survivability was reduced more than necessary in her last round of changes so we’re partially reverting the cooldown increase to Javelin Spin. Roadhog Base health reduced from 650 to 600. Take a Breather Damage reduction reduced from 50 to 40%. Developer Comments: Roadhog’s already-powerful survivability increased significantly with the headshot damage reduction from the tank role passive so these changes are to help bring that back in line. DAMAGE Cassidy Flashbang Magnetic Grenade ability is now Flashbang. Hinders enemies instead of Stunning them for 1.2 seconds. Movement speed reduction increased from 30% to 50%. Hinder now prevents crouching movement. 45 explosive damage. 12 second cooldown. Deadeye Movement speed penalty now scales down over time, from 70% to 35%. Damage reduction now scales down over time, from 40% to 0%. Combat Roll Damage reduction reduced from 75 to 50%. Peacekeeper Secondary fire “Fan the Hammer” damage reduced from 50 to 45. Developer Comments: We’re reverting the Magnetic Grenade ability to be deployed like Cassidy’s previous Flashbang ability, but it will keep the Hinder effect instead of a full stun. We’ve heard feedback surrounding the Magnetic Grenade ability and agree that while the fantasy of a homing grenade was fun, the moment-to-moment gameplay of it often felt too unpredictable as to whether it would land or not. The Hinder effect has been a useful tool to act as a counter to highly mobile heroes without going back to a full stun and the enemy player losing the ability to fight back. The Deadeye ultimate is getting an adjustment to increase its flexibility toward the end of its duration, enabling it to get value outside of buying time for Cassidy or his allies, though it may be riskier to hold it for a long time as the damage reduction will fade away along with the movement speed penalty. Mei Endothermic Blaster Secondary fire base projectile size reduced from 0.15 to 0.12 meters. Secondary fire damage increased from 75 to 85. Developer Comments: Mei’s damage output over time is intended to be on the low end for a Damage hero, as she offers strong utility and survivability through her ability kit, but we would like to make the secondary fire icicle more rewarding by increasing the damage and slightly more difficult to land consistently. Reaper Hellfire Shotguns Weapon spread reduced from 6.5 to 6 degrees. Shadow Step Cast time reduced from 1.5 to 1.2 seconds. Developer Comments: With the previous patch change to how armor reduces damage, shotgun weapon heroes like Reaper lost some value since much of their gameplan revolved around pressuring large tank heroes. To help shift Reaper toward being more effective against smaller targets we’re tightening the weapon spread on the Hellfire Shotguns and reducing the amount of time enemies have to react to his Shadow Step teleport. Sojourn Railgun Secondary fire damage scaling reduced from 30-130 damage down to 1-100 damage. Secondary fire projectile no longer requires Overclock to pierce enemy players. Primary fire shots per second increased from 14 to 16. Overclock Energy charge rate increased from 100 to 120 per second. Developer Comments: This change is reducing the burst damage potential of the secondary fire Railgun shot to both lessen frustration from playing against that burst damage, and to shift power into her sustained primary fire damage. This should smooth out the feast-or-famine nature of Sojourn consistently hitting the secondary fire shots. Symmetra Base health increased from 100 to 125 (Total health increased from 250 to 275). Photon Projector Primary fire charge rate increased 25%. Developer Comments: To help solidify Symmetra as a close-range threat, we’re increasing her health to better survive in that range, along with how quickly her primary fire beam damage ramps up. SUPPORT Illari Healing Pylon Healing per projectile increased from 30 to 40. Pylon healing is now only half as effective when targeting Illari. Max health increased from 100 to 125. Outburst Damage increased from 10 to 25. Developer Comments: Illari’s Healing Pylon is intended to be useful for healing her team in relatively safe positions without much focus required, which enables her to either apply pressure with her primary fire or spot heal in bursts from her more limited secondary fire healing beam. To encourage this, it now has improved health and healing output, but is less effective when Illari uses it to heal herself. Kiriko Protection Suzu No longer cleanses hard knockdown stuns. Swift Step Cooldown increased from 7 to 8 seconds. Developer Comments: “Hard knockdown stuns” refer to most all of the existing knockdowns where the player is stunned and laying on the ground (such as Reinhardt’s Earthshatter), with the exception of Ana’s Sleep Dart effect, which is removed upon taking damage or Protection Suzu’s cleanse. Map Updates Colosseo Removed the glass and added stairs at first checkpoint for additional pathing and combat opportunities. Extended the map with a new lowered section and mega health pack behind the second checkpoint for flank/rotational strategies Added a route through a building that connects spawn/final point to second checkpoint. The initial spawn building has been pulled back to give players more room to smoothly navigate the area out front. There is no added run back time with this change. The stairs and cover surrounding the final point have been adjusted to improve the flow of the space and to help teams safely defend the final point. Push Game Mode Reduced the match time from 10 minutes to 8 minutes in Quick Play. Increased push robot speed by 10% when pushing the barricade for both Quick Play and Competitive. Bug Fixes Maps Numbani Fixed pieces of the environment that allowed abilities to pass through it. New Junk City Fixed lighting in some areas of the map. Hollywood Fixed areas of the map that could cause players to become temporarily stuck. Heroes Junker Queen Fixed a bug that caused Junker Queen’s Commanding Shout to play the audio again when using a Teleporter. Reinhardt Charge now correctly damages Ice Wall and Tree of Life. Venture Fixed an interaction that allowed Venture to stay burrowed indefinitely. Fixed the description of Drill Dash to match its functionality. Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that could allow it to charge Venture’s Ultimate Meter some situations. Zarya Fixed an interaction where a Particle Shielded Zarya standing on a Teleporter could prevent teammates from using the teleporter. ",

        "contents": "Overwatch would not be where it is without you. You’ve pushed the payload, fought to capture the point, and cheered your teams to victory. Whether you are a tank main, damage one-trick, or support superstar, you’re all heroes. Since Overwatch launched in 2016, we’ve had over 100 million players answer the call, and we’re celebrating this milestone with something very special. One of our favorite memories from this history of Overwatch is when we all came together for a great cause and helped make a difference in the lives of those affected by breast cancer. In May 2018, we introduced the Pink Mercy skin, which helped raise $12.7 million USD for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the number-one cause of cancer-related deaths in women globally. It is BCRF’s mission to prevent and cure breast cancer by advancing the world’s most promising research. Thanks to all of you, the original two-week campaign became the biggest single donation to BCRF - and still holds that record to this day! It fueled BCRF’s Precision Prevention Initiative (PPI) and key breakthroughs in breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and metastasis (a.k.a. stage 4 breast cancer). Specifically, the 2018 donation helped fund researchers who advanced promising AI tools in mammogram imaging, devised models to better predict how aggressive breast cancers will respond to treatment, identify drugs that could potentially delay tumor formation, and more. Now, to answer the call of so many of you who have been asking for Pink Mercy in the years since, and to once again support an incredible cause, we’re excited to announce beginning on June 25, you can purchase the original Pink Mercy skin for the original price of $14.99 USD, with 100% of the purchase price (excluding any applicable platform fees and taxes) to be donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.* {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/a379b79027a1c1312322ade8d727a108db8a178a.png And that’s not all! We’re also giving everyone the chance to help support this cause with a brand-new charity cosmetic bundle, the Rose Gold Mercy bundle, also available for purchase for a limited time starting on June 25. This bundle will be exclusively available for a limited time for $19.99 USD, and just like Pink Mercy, 100% of the purchase price (excluding any applicable platform fees and taxes) will be donated to BCRF*, funding critical breast cancer research. The bundle includes the all-new Rose Gold hero skin, plus the Mercy Heroic Weapon Skin—so you can show your support on whatever Mercy skin you choose! Plus, you’ll get three sprays, name cards, and player icons designed by community artists Angela Ziegler (@A2Ziegler) and Dani Ellis (@OWGrandma) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/c28085bf6381f7adee1f42ca74700f2527a0214d.png Whether you get a hold of the original Pink Mercy skin or the Rose Gold Mercy Bundle, you’ll be helping to fuel the research that gives people who have breast cancer longer, healthier lives. Answer the call of this wonderful cause from Tuesday, June 25 through Monday, July 8. Thank you for being a part of this incredible community—together, we are excited to once again make a difference! Frequently Asked Questions Q. Where can I go to learn more about the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and how contributions help support breast cancer research? A. The Breast Cancer Research Foundation is a nonprofit organization committed to achieving prevention and a cure for breast cancer by advancing the world’s most promising research. BCRF provides critical funding to scientists around the globe to fuel advances in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, metastasis and survivorship.

The Foundation is recognized as one of the most financially efficient nonprofits in the country and is the highest-rated breast cancer research organization in the U.S. You can read about how our 2018 campaign helped support innovative, lifesaving breast cancer research in this blog or on bcrf.org.

Developer Comments: As we continue to monitor Venture's gameplay throughout their release Season, we are making a change today that adds more flexibility to using Drill Dashes.

        "contents": "OVERWATCH 2 X PORSCHE Overwatch 2 and Porsche team up for an electric collaboration to showcase the shared essence of these two high-performance brands in an all-new event. Experience the fusion with Legendary Porsche D.Va and Porsche Pharah skins available now in the Premium Shop, plus earn other free high-voltage Porsche-themed cosmetics through event challenges now through June 3. COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES Demotion Protection Modifier The Demotion Protection modifier has been moved from below the Rank Progress bar into the bar itself to improve visibility when a player is in a Demotion Protection state. When Demotion Protection occurs, you will not be told when your progress is below that skill division’s range. If you lose your Demotion match, the Skill Rank adjustment will show only the adjustment from that match, instead of the net total of that match and the adjustment of the previous match. New - Pressure Competitive Modifier This rank modifier appears for players who are at the far ends of the overall skill distribution. For players who are very high ranked (like Champion), this modifier will show when you don’t earn as much progress from winning a match or drop more progress for losing a match. For players who are very low ranked (like low Bronze), this modifier will show when you earn more progress for winning a match or drop less progress for losing a match. Developer comments: This new modifier was added to show how our highest and lowest-skill players are being pushed toward a more average Rank. Competitive Play already calculates this Modifier to your Skill Rank adjustment, but it wasn't visible until now. Very high or very low-ranked players will see this Modifier after every match while they continue to maintain a Rank at the outer limits of the ranked spectrum. Climbing to the highest skill tiers like Grand Masters or Champions is not intended to be easy, and overcoming Pressure to reach the top is no longer a hidden challenge that players must face. Grouping Restrictions The Skill Tier legend was updated to show the changes to grouping restrictions that were applied in a previous update. The grouping restriction changes we applied are the following: Grand Master can now group within 3 divisions to be considered a narrow group. Champion can now group within 1 division to be considered a narrow group. Developer comment: While the Season 10 changes to grouping up with friends have contributed to a large improvement in match quality for most players, we’re still looking to reduce queue times for players and groups, especially for higher ranks. MATCHMAKING UPDATES When a player is currently on a loss streak, the matchmaker will try to avoid putting the player on a team that is statistically calculated to have a lower chance of winning. Developer comments: Loss streaks never feel good. Before each match, we make a prediction about which team will win the game, based on the information we have about the players on both teams. This is how modifiers such as Consolation, Reversal, Uphill Battle, and Expected give or take additional Rank Progress after each Competitive Play match. Since most matches will have a team that has a slightly higher chance of winning, placing a player on the team with the higher chance who is currently on a losing streak is aimed at helping them have a fair chance of breaking that streak. While this won't guarantee they'll win, it does provide a helping advantage. HERO UPDATES GENERAL Armor health has been reverted to provide a flat damage reduction of 5 per projectile, up to a maximum of 50% damage reduction. Out-of-combat health regeneration changed from 20 health per second to 10 health per second + 5% of maximum health. Developer comment: Armor is being reverted to its original functionality to better resistance rapid fire damage and shotgun-type weapons. Out-of-combat health regeneration has been a positive but subtle addition to the game, but had a much smaller impact for tank heroes due to their massive health pools, so we're adjusting it to heal for a percentage of maximum health. TANKS Role Passive Tanks now have 25% damage reduction against critical headshot damage. Knockback resistance increased from 30% to 50% Developer Comment: Although armor health will now be more effective in some of the more difficult matchups, it will also be losing potency against the typically slower, higher damage instances. To help reduce the feeling of tanks being taken out too quickly by high bursts of damage, the role-wide passive now provides improved defense against critical headshot damage. Junker Queen Commanding Shout Can now be activated while using other abilities. Cooldown reduced from 14 to 12 seconds. Developer Comment: Junker Queen being able to activate Commanding Shout while swinging her axe or during her Ultimate ability will make it more responsive for when an additional burst of health or movement speed is needed. Sigma Gravitic Flux No longer requires line of sight to the center of the effect. Developer Comment: Similar to how Graviton Surge functions, Gravitic Flux no longer needs line of sight to affect enemy targets in its area. There are a fair amount of counterplay options to deal with this ultimate so we're making it more reliable to grab enemy targets within its area of effect. Wrecking Ball Grappling Claw Impact damage increased from 50 to 60. Piledriver Movement lockout duration for enemies increased from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds. Minefield Damage increased from 130 to 165. Explosion knockback increased from 5 to 10. Developer Comment: Wrecking Ball has been performing much better after his recent update and these tuning changes will help his abilities feel more impactful. Zarya Graviton Surge Radius increased from 6 to 7 meters. Duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds Developer Comment: We have been increasing the value of some tank ultimate abilities to account for the increased health pools and it helps to make the decision of when to counter-swap more of an interesting tradeoff. Graviton Surge was still very useful to set up combos with other ultimate abilities but we want to makes sure it's powerful enough on its own. DAMAGE Junkrat Frag Launcher Impact damage increased from 40 to 45 (Total damage increased from 120 to 125). Developer Comment: Junkrat's weapon has great damage output but is unreliable outside of close range due to its slow projectile speed, which is an intended drawback to its high output. The Season 9 health changes affected Junkrat more than most other heroes since it now requires one more shot to secure an elimination. We're increasing the damage on direct impacts to return to 2 direct hits for an elimination, without making his combo with Concussion Mine as deadly as before since that one is much easier to execute. Echo Duplicate Ultimate gain multiplier while transformed increased from 4 to 4.5. Developer Comment: While the main benefit of Duplicate is a second health pool and the utility of another hero's abilities, it was often too difficult to charge an ultimate in the Duplicate time limit so we're increasing the bonus multiplier slightly. Hanzo Dragonstrike Speed increased from 12 to 15 meters per second. Developer Comment: The Dragonstrike ultimate hasn't been very effective outside of being used in a combo with other abilities that restrict enemy movement, so we're increasing its speed to help position it as less of a zoning tool and more likely to deal some damage. SUPPORT Brigitte Rally Now resets Shield Bash cooldown upon activation. Developer Comment: Resetting the Shield Bash cooldown on ultimate activation was too much potential burst damage for Brigitte when the average maximum health of everyone was lower, but it's much more reasonable now that it won't be as lethal. BUG FIXES GENERAL Fixed a bug with Mirrorwatch not generating stats in Game Reports. Fixed a bug with Competitive Progress not incrementing correctly. MAPS General bug fixes and improvements were performed on multiple maps. Eichenwalde Fixed an area that could cause players to temporarily become stuck. Samoa Fixed a spot on the map that players could become temporarily stuck in . Shambali Fixed a location where players could become stuck for a period of time. HEROES Mercy Vengeance Skin - Fixed a bug with the feathers on the skin not being properly aligned. Venture Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that counted turrets and other non-player targets as valid for the Excavation Annihilation challenge. Fixed an issue that could occur with Burrow where Venture could remain burrowed above the ground. ",

        "contents": "Hey, everyone! I’m glad to see all of you digging into Season 10. We’ve loved seeing you welcome our newest hero, Venture, and enjoy the Mirrorwatch event (playable now in the Arcade!). However, this week, I want to look ahead to our midseason update and discuss some changes we have on the way for the Tank role. In Overwatch 2, tanks are the imposing heroes who take the brunt of the fight while enabling their teammates to secure eliminations.  While tanks are a big target for opponents to focus on, many team comps aim to burn down a Tank’s HP quickly, or they get moved around a lot from displacement abilities. We’ve received feedback that tanks can either feel like they get taken down too quickly in a fight or that they’re impossible to take down.   So, our midseason update is going to help balance how many hits tanks can take to stay in the fight better.  First, we’re specifically buffing the Tank passive to have a 25% damage reduction from headshots, which should help cut down on being burst down in a fight. We’re also increasing the knockback resistance for tanks from 30% to 50%, which should allow them to hold the front line a lot more and not feel as subjected to displacement abilities. We’re also making some global gameplay changes that impact tanks. One is that we’re reverting the Armor damage reduction back to reducing five damage per projectile with up to a 50% maximum. This means heroes like Reaper or Tracer will have more work to do to take down heroes like Reinhardt.  Heroes with high burst damage per projectile will still be effective but these kinds of Tanks have better means to counterplay that type of damage. Next, we made a light change to our overall HP recovery passive that will enable mobile tanks to get back to the front lines faster: The health regeneration passive for all heroes will no longer recover 20 HP per second out of combat but instead recover 10 Health + 5% of their maximum HP per second. This means a hero like Reinhardt will recover their health at 45 health per second in a Role Queue match. Altogether, these changes should have an impact on some of the pain points our tank players are experiencing, as well as the balance of the game. I have a feeling we’ll see a lot of movement in the meta over the remainder of Season 10. In some more individual changes, Junker Queen is getting a buffed Commanding Shout, which will be activated even if you are channeling other abilities like Carnage or Rampage, and its cooldown is getting reduced to 12 seconds. This change should allow her to be more engaged in intense fights where you need to charge in more quickly. With Wrecking Ball, we’re seeing some creative play with the changes to his Grappling Claw; however, his ability to contribute to the fight is getting a small buff. The impact damage from a full-charged swing using Grappling Claw is getting increased from 50 to 60. Piledriver is increasing the enemy movement lockout from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds. And finally, Minefield will be a little more threatening, with explosion damage increased from 130 to 165 and knockback increased from 5 to 10 meters. Additional changes coming this midseason include some light buffs for Junkrat, Echo, and Hanzo, but we’ll reveal those when you can jump and take these changes for a test drive when the Midseason patch arrives on May 14. That’s all for this week, everyone! Thanks for reading, and let’s make a great game. ",

        "contents": "We’re thrilled that Venture is finally in the hero lineup, and it’s been fun to see you get your hands on their groundbreaking kit and mechanics. Today two developers who were part of our newest hero's strike team will share a behind-the-scenes look at how Venture, became Venture. Hero strike teams consist of many different disciplines across Team 4. There is no one formula for how heroes come to life, but it always starts with assembling a group of developers who will embark on the journey of creating a new hero together. Today, we’re going to hear from two of those developers – one concept artist and one narrative designer - to talk about how Venture’s art and aesthetic were created, as well as how their character and personality came to life. Let’s get into it! Venture’s Concept Art Hi! I’m Daryl Tan, Lead Character Concept Artist on Team 4. Being on the team that brought Venture to life was an incredible experience, and I’d like to share some of that with you! I’m going to walk us through some early concepts and talk about how we landed on Venture’s finalized artwork. When we started the early concept phases for Venture, the only thing we knew about the hero was that we wanted this hero to dig underground – so, they needed a huge drill. Senior concept artist Kejun Wang tried multiple themes and configurations for the drill, including sound-based drills and exosuit setups. This early phase is where the concept team really gets to experiment and set the creative direction for the art of the hero. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/d3dd0326569685530a87076e4816f9ce9b277f94.jpg Concept art is one piece of the puzzle when it comes to making a hero. Every hero has this taskforce (so to speak) that includes developers from hero design, concept art, animation, narrative—roughly, about 13-14 developers in total work on a single hero. For Venture, narrative designer Miranda Moyer worked closely with us to land on the direction of a swashbuckling archeologist. We thought this was an awesome idea, so we started to lean into this overall aesthetic—a daring explorer with a big drill. This character background also inspired their development code name: ‘Miner’. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/f7d80479f59c30c72198578baca49999737a3723.jpg Their early concept combined a bunch of ideas from the blue-sky concepts above (a “blue-sky” concept is when you set no barriers for your creativity). If you look closely, you can see which elements we picked out from those thumbnails! There are other elements we need to consider while creating new concepts. For example, we want our heroes to have recognizable silhouettes—not just for gameplay reasons, but also to solidify them individually and celebrate the uniqueness of all our heroes. We gave Venture a big backpack and longer coat because these elements felt unique to Venture’s identity, as well as differentiating their silhouette from other heroes’. We were really excited by the drill concept and thought it was really cool, but we had to visualize what this would look like in 3D. We worked closely with our character art team to block out some of these early ideas for the drill to see how they resonate in-game.  While we liked the vibe and presence of the drill’s initial concept, what we had on paper didn’t feel right in 3D from a first-person perspective. We needed the drill to be immediately recognizable at a glance, so we streamlined the shape of the drill head into a more iconic, conical shape. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/ab7352f865a76ac30249f8e96edff967d5af222b.jpg We took these early 3D mockups to puzzle out all the complex moving parts on the Smart Excavator. You can see the two different states, drill and canon, and how we started to piece out their aesthetics, representing their respective functions. This is an extremely collaborative process, including developers from modeling, animation, concept art, and many other teams. We enjoyed partnering together to juggle all the different shapes and movements of Venture’s various components, all while making sure everything was recognizable, looking good from the player perspective and feeling good in-game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/50f91c63685974a1fc76b864cbcc00d4d7149c54.jpg The way Venture holds their drill was inspired by motorcycle themes, which you can see manifest in the look of its overall shape looked and how loud the drill is meant to be. This inspiration also led to bike-inspired flame decals on the weapon and the flame tattoo on their neck. Another fun tidbit around the design—Venture's off-hand grip of their weapon was inspired by vacuum cleaners! Putting together Venture’s finalized concept art was an extremely collaborative process for the hero strike team. We draw inspiration from unlikely places, as well as each other, which is why the team always feels empowered to try new things—however outlandish they might be sometimes! We’re really happy with where Venture’s art landed. We think their overall aesthetic fits well with their personality and character, but I will let our awesome narrative designer, Miranda Moyer, tell you more about that! See you in-game! Darly Tan, Lead Character Concept Artist Narrative design for a swashbuckling archeologist Hi! I’m Miranda Moyer, senior narrative designer on Team 4. Venture’s story and background were interesting to craft because everything was inspired by their gameplay kit. Venture’s development name was ‘Miner’ because the team wanted to build around the idea of a giant drill. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/2aac2d666e00aafc269b62a481a43979e42f5acb.png We started exploring different archetypes that matched this gameplay and weapon, and this inspiration led us to archaeology. We asked ourselves what an archeologist looks like in the bright, hopeful future of Overwatch. Our story ignited this romantic idea that even the well-charted world of the future is still full of mystery and adventure if you’re willing to look for it. We built on this idea to create their personality. To fit the archetype of an adventurous archaeologist, we wanted someone who was daring, passionate, and unabashedly themselves. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/08602125b08d1126b80b846e13942facbd9cfddb.png This personality ended up meshing really well with Venture’s gender identity. Venture is our first trans non-binary hero, and they use they/them pronouns. To ensure we would represent Venture’s identity as authentically as possible, the development team for Venture worked very closely with the LGBT Network at Blizzard as well as gender non-conforming developers on Team 4, gathering feedback and refining them over time. We even consulted with a queer fashion company to help us realize Venture in a way that felt most true to their identity and the queer community at large. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/7bfff1f0e84a357cb267a18c1b2c64d151cc6a3b.png Venture overflows with enthusiasm for the world and all its history. Their hands-on personality shines in their animations, voice, and gameplay. Above all, Venture is willing to do anything it takes to solve whatever mystery they’re chasing (even if they might chomp on a few rocks along the way). We hope you have as much fun playing them as we did bringing them to life. We’d dig that :D Miranda Moyer, Senior Narrative Designer ",

        "contents": "Overwatch 2 Retail Patch Notes – April 16, 2024 Check out the latest patch notes for Overwatch 2! Limited-Time Mode: Clash Trial Clash is an upcoming core game mode in Overwatch 2. Teams must battle back and forth over 5 capture points, with each captured objective adding a point to the prevailing team's score. Teams can win in two ways: either by having control of all five objectives at once, or by scoring five points total before the other team. Clash will be available as a limited-time trial through April 29. How Clash is played • Five total objectives placed in a linear pattern on a mirrored map. • Only one objective is active at a time. • Matches start with the center objective active. • Players capture an objective by standing on it and filling in a progress bar. Capture progress cannot be made if enemy players are contesting the objective. • When a team captures the current objective, they are awarded one point to their total score and a new objective moving forward from the scoring team’s side is activated. • Objectives can be secured multiple times. If a team is pushed off an objective and the other team successfully captures it, the next active point will be in the opposite direction. Win Conditions Complete one of these conditions to win the match: • A team has successfully captured five objectives throughout the match to reach a total score of five. • Regardless of score, a team manages to take the final objective (A or E) on the opponents’ side. Hanaoka – New Map Explore never-before-seen corners of Hanamura in the new map Hanaoka, inspired by the visual themes of the beloved Assault map. Explore the shops and restaurants around town or follow the scent of Sakura trees into the once-proud Shimada castle. Mythic Hero Skin Updates Mythic Hero Skins • Mythic Hero Skins are now unlocked in the new Mythic Shop in exchange for Mythic Prisms. • Mythic Hero Skins are unlocked for 50 Mythic Prisms with a starting set of customizations and then can be leveled up with 10 Mythic Prisms per level. You can unlock the skin and all available customizations for a Mythic Hero Skin for 80 Prisms. Introducing Mythic Prisms • Mythic Prisms can be earned in the Premium Battle Pass and used in the Mythic Shop to purchase the current featured Mythic Hero Skin for the season and select previous Mythic hero skins. You can earn a total of 80 Mythic Prisms when you complete Premium Battle Pass. • Earning Mythic Prisms in the Premium Battle Pass is the easiest way to unlock a Mythic Hero Skin and all customizations each season. You can also purchase additional Mythic Prisms in game or in your platform’s store marketplace. General Updates Challenges • Completing Weekly Challenge milestones will now reward additional Battle Pass XP. • Overwatch Coins that were earned in the Weekly Challenges can now be earned in the Battle Pass for all players. • Reduced the number of Weekly Challenges. Developer Comments: The number of Weekly Challenges has grown over time, and we are simplifying what players can aim to accomplish, while also making earning Battle Pass XP more straightforward. Endorsement Changes • Players who are actioned for disruptive behavior and reduced to Endorsement Level 0 cannot use text or voice chat features until they return to Endorsement Level 1. Developer Comments: Since we added the Endorsement system to Overwatch, players who have been actioned because of social reports (Inappropriate Communication, Gameplay Sabotage, etc) have had their Endorsement Level reduced to Level 0. That part of the system isn't changing, but going forward, Level 0 players will no longer be able to speak in voice channels or type in text chat in most modes. Hide My Name • Updated option in Streamer Protect, found in your Social Options. • You are now able to hide your BattleTag from other players in your group and from your friends in the match as well. • When enabled, anywhere your BattleTag is displayed to players during a match now displays a random anonymized BattleTag, instead of only to the player with the \"Hide My Name\" setting visibly enabled. Developer Comments: \"The \"Hide My Name\" setting in the Social Options now displays a random anonymized Battle Tag to all players in a match, instead of only to the player with the \"Hide My Name\" setting enabled. New settings have been added to \"Hide My Name From Friends\" and \"Hide My Name From Group.\" Of these two settings, \"Hide My Name From Friends\" takes priority when group members are also friends. A large list of hand-crafted BattleTags have been created to support this feature. Could it contain easter eggs or silly references?\" Progression • Added progression badges/sub-badges and rewards for Venture. Rewards can be found in Hero Challenges. Leaver Penalties Two new thresholds for Unranked Leave Penalties have been added: • Leaving two out of 20 games will result in a 5-minute suspension from queuing for most modes. • 10 or more out of 20 games will result in a 48-hour suspension from queuing for most modes. • All other threshold tiers are unchanged. Developer Comments: Overwatch 2 is a competitive game even for Unranked game modes, and the match experience for all remaining players is negatively affected when a player leaves before it is completed. Remember a penalty only applies when you leave games and not when you complete games. By introducing a lighter 5-minute penalty, we aim to discourage players from deliberately leaving games they don’t want to play, while not impacting those who may have a technical issue or an urgent need to step away from the game which they can resolve by the time the queue suspension is finished. The larger 48-hour suspension aims to target a very small portion of players who are aggressively leaving games. • Leaving 10 games in Competitive Play will now result in a season ban regardless of the number of games completed. • Players can still get banned from Competitive Play in as few as 5 games if they leave very consistently and don’t complete enough games to get back into good standing. • Games completed in Competitive Play now count toward the 20-game window of the Unranked Leaver Penalty. Developer Comments: We already suspend players who leave a Competitive and increase penalties up to a season ban for leaving games frequently, but players can work their way back into good standing if they complete several matches. However, this new rule will stop players from gaming the system over time. Competitive Updates Competitive Role-Specific Titles • End-of-season titles for Competitive Role Queue now include the role the rank was achieved in. • Examples include Champion Tank, Champion Support, Champion Damage, and Open Queue Champion. Competitive Progress • Each Role Rank Card now displays the associated Competitive Role-Specific title. • Role Rank Cards can now be selected to open the Match History for the selected role. • Match history will display the following: Map / Game Mode, Heroes / Role, Date, Score, Results of the match • Match History can now be selected to open the Game Report for a match. Grouping Restrictions • All previous Competitive Grouping Restrictions have been removed. • All groups in Competitive Play are now classified as Narrow or Wide. • Players between Bronze and Diamond must be within five divisions of each other player in their group to be in a Narrow Group. • Players at Master must be within three divisions of each other player in their group to be in a Narrow Group. • Players at Grandmaster and Champion cannot be in Narrow groups, regardless of how close their ranks are. This restriction ensures that our highest-ranked players have the highest quality Narrow matches. • Narrow Groups will always be matched against other Narrow Groups or solo players. If a group has both Wide and Narrow configurations of players, the Narrow configuration will always be prioritized. • Any group that does not meet the criteria is considered a Wide Group. • Wide Groups of four players may not queue. This restriction exists so that solo players are never required to make a Wide match. • Wide Groups have increased queue times and reduced match quality because it’s more difficult to find another group of players with the same ranks in the same roles to match against. • The amount a player’s Rank Progress changes after each match is modified by the group’s width. • The wider the group is, the less their ranks will change when winning or losing. • The higher the rank of the highest-ranked player in a Wide Group, the less the ranks of all players in the group will change when winning or losing. • Players will now be informed if the configuration of roles they have selected would result in a Wide Group. • The Tier Legend has been updated, and a new banner has been added to explain the rules described above. Rank Information • New Modifier: “Wide”—this modifier reduces changes in Rank Progress when winning or losing matches. The wider your group, the less your Rank Progress will change with each win or loss. • The modifier “Volatile” has been renamed to “Demotion.” • Arrows displayed under the modifiers have been changed to point from left to right instead of right to left. • New Modifier: Demotion Protection • This modifier appears on the Rank Progress bar to denote when you did not go down in Skill Division because of a loss. If you lose the next match after, then you are dropped down to the previous Skill Division. • Victory and Defeat have been added below the Rank Progress bar where modifiers are displayed. Golden Weapons • Golden weapons can now be purchased with either Legacy Competitive Points or 2024 Competitive Points. You cannot purchase weapons with a combination of both currencies. Hero Updates New Hero: Venture • Venture has been added to the line-up. • Venture is immediately available to play in Competitive Play. Developer Comments: This is a pretty major change from past heroes, but we’ve always wanted to allow new heroes into Competitive when a new season for Overwatch 2 launches. In the past, we wanted to make sure new heroes were free of any bugs or outstanding balance issues, as well as giving players enough time to unlock a hero from the Battle Pass. Because of the recent hero trial, we’re confident Venture is ready to jump into the action right away.. Tanks Doomfist Rocket Punch • The empowered punch is no longer consumed when the windup is canceled by using Seismic Slam or Power Block. Developer Comments: This quality-of-life improvement streamlines the transition between charging up an empowered Rocket Punch and another ability by removing the requirement of pressing the cancel input first. Junker Queen Carnage • Impact damage increased from 90 to 105. Reinhardt Earthshatter • Knockdown duration increased from 2.75 to 3 seconds. • Shockwave range increased from 20 to 25 meters. Sigma Experimental Barrier • Movement speed increased from 16.5 to 20 meters per second. Developer Comments: This change will improve Sigma's ability to protect allies that are further away from him. Wrecking Ball Grappling Claw • Hold the jump input while the Grappling Claw is attached to terrain to retract it, pulling yourself towards the anchor point. This action can be rebound in his hero settings. • Now has a one second cooldown if Wrecking Ball never reaches ramming speed before canceling the ability. Interrupting him with Hack, Hinder, and stuns will still trigger the full cooldown. • The maximum duration timer no longer triggers unless he reaches ramming speed. Adaptive Shield • Can now be reactivated to redistribute up to 300 overhealth to nearby allies, capping at 75 per person. • Enemy and ally detection radius increased from 10 to 13 meters. Minefield • Health increased from 50 to 60. Developer Comments: The general goals here are to add a direct way for Wrecking Ball to support his allies aside from purely enemy team disruption, make the hero more approachable while also adding more avenues for skill expression, and improve quality of life around the grapple. Damage Sombra Virus • Total damage over time decreased from 100 to 90. Tracer Recall • Cooldown increased from 12 to 13 seconds. Pulse Bomb • Base projectile size decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 meters. The total projectile size is now 0.25 meters. Developer Comments: There is now more downtime before Tracer can safely reengage after driving her away and Pulse Bomb will require more precision. Venture Drill Dash • Impact damage decreased from 60 to 40. • Damage over time increased from 40 to 60. Clobber • Impact damage decreased from 40 to 30. • Damage over time increased from 30 to 40. Tectonic Shock • Vertical knockback decreased by 30%. Developer Comments: We are redistributing the damage on some of their abilities so that positioning relative to the enemy and tracking a target are more important for dealing maximum damage. Support Illari Solar Rifle • Primary fire recovery increased from 0.2 to 0.25 seconds. • Secondary fire heal-per-second increased from 105 to 115. Lúcio Sonic Amplifier • Damage per projectile decreased from 20 to 18. Soundwave • Damage increased from 35 to 45. Lifeweaver Rejuvenating Dash • Heal increased from 50 to 60. Tree of Life • Pulse healing increased from 75 to 90. Moira Biotic Grasp • Damage per second decreased from 65 to 60. Coalescence • Self-heal per second increased from 50 to 55. Bug Fixes General • Hero Mastery Gauntlet - fixed a bug that could cause more AI teammates than intended. • Fixed a bug with Wall Climb that could allow Heroes with the passive to climb infinitely. • Fixed a bug with Diamond, Masters, and Grandmaster not playing any effects when entering the Top 500. • Fixed a bug with duplicate entries on the Leaderboard. • Fixed the missing flash notification on taskbar when joining a game as a backfill. Maps • Fixed in a previous update - resolved an issue where jump pads could become deactivated. Circuit Royale • Fixed an issue with the payload tires launching players unexpectedly. Paraiso • Fixed an area near the second point where the payload dock could negatively impact Earth Shatter and Tectonic Shock's ability to hit larger heroes. Heroes Echo • Fixed an issue with Duplicate that could prevent a death being counted if it was used as Echo falls off the map. Doomfist • Fixed an interaction with Mei's Ice Wall that could allow you to get under the map. • Fixed a bug with Power Block sounds triggering even if it was not blocking damage. Illari • Fixed an issue with Captive Sun affecting targets through floors and ceilings. Junkrat • Fixed a bug with Riptire receiving the self-healing passive. Lifeweaver • Fixed a bug where some un-targetable heroes could be healed by Tree of Life. Mauga • Fixed an interaction with Overrun and Brigitte's Shield Bash that resulted in Mauga being knocked down with Overrun active. Mercy Fixed a bug with the Caduceus Staff not opening up with the Parasol emote and Pose. Venture Fixed a bug that would prevent Drill Dash from activating while underground if the input was pressed while falling through the air and Burrow was active. Fixed a bug where Drill Dash could deal damage multiple times with the initial impact and instantly kill targets or knock them back exceedingly far. Fixed a bug where certain heroes were still being pushed back even if they escaped from Drill Dash. Fixed a bug where Venture would sometimes launch very far if using Drill Dash off a ledge while Burrowed. Fixed a bug where attempting to emerge during Burrow near ledges would sometimes end the ability prematurely. Fixed a bug where the third-person camera would snap back to first-person instantly if you were in the air when burrow ended. Fixed a bug where UI prompts for emerging and Drill Dash were not visible during Burrow. Fixed a bug that could allow players to prevent footfall audio from playing. ",

        "contents": "Mythic hero skins are the ultimate customization for heroes in Overwatch 2. Every Mythic hero skin is uniquely crafted to push the limits in artwork, animation, and effects. Players have had the chance to Dragon Blade in high-tech style with Cyberdemon Genji, conquer the galaxy with Infinite Emperor Sigma, and save Overland with Adventurer Tracer. Now, whether you are coming back for a new season or are a brand-new player, you can collect the Mythic hero skins for your favorite heroes and level up with the customizations you want in the all-new Mythic Shop. We’re excited to give you the choice of what Mythic skins you want to collect, and this update is just the start as we continue to evolve Mythic cosmetics. Keep reading how you can progress through the Premium Battle Pass and earn your way to your next Mythic skin. Collect New Mythic Prisms in the Premium Battle Pass We’re giving you the choice to select your own Mythic Hero skin. Whether you are adding the new Vengeance Mercy Mythic, or getting a skin for one of your favorite heroes, you get to pick what Mythic hero skin to unlock by collecting Mythic Prisms. The best way to get Mythic Prisms is by collecting them as you progress through the Premium Battle Pass. Here’s how it will work. Starting on Tier 8, you’ll collect 8 Mythic Prisms every 10 tiers until Tier 78. At Tier 48, you’ll be able to unlock the base level of Mythic hero skin that you want to collect and can unlock more customization levels every time you earn 10 Mythic Prisms. Once you complete Tier 78 of your Premium Battle Pass, you’ll earn enough Mythic Prisms to unlock the remaining customization levels for your Mythic hero skin. Completing your Premium Battle Pass every season is the best way to earning Mythic Prisms, allowing you to unlock the choice of your next Mythic hero skin and all of that skin’s customizations every season. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/3309cd7bfa09e04a84f85bcb028beeeac828540b.png Choose Your Mythic Mythic Prisms can be redeemed in the Mythic Shop, dedicated entirely to collecting Mythic hero skins. Each season, you can spend your Mythic Prisms on the newest Mythic hero skin released that season or choose from your favorite Mythic hero skins released in earlier seasons. Right now, you can be among the first players to unlock the new Vengeance Mercy Mythic Hero Skin, which is the featured Mythic skin for Season 10. The featured Mythic hero skin for each season will only be available for a limited time to redeem—the length of that season—then cycle out of the Mythic Shop for the following two seasons. You can continue to upgrade your owned Mythic hero skins with levels of customization even after that skin leaves the Mythic Shop after their featured season ends. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/ca2c4642b720d183a4820dd71033e69bd467e591.png The Mythic shop allows you to get the Mythic hero skins you want to get first or catch up from past seasons you may have missed. While not every previous Mythic skin will be immediately available, you’ll be able to pick up the Mythic hero skins from Seasons 1 through 7, including favorites like Cyberdemon Genji, Sun Deity Kiriko, and A6000 Warbot Ana, just to name a few starting in Season 10. When Season 11 comes, you have your chance again to pick up Grand Beast Orisa. Then in Season 12, you can have another chance to summon Ancient Caller Moira and add her to your collection. Level Up Your Mythic Each Mythic hero skin will now have multiple levels of unlockable customization, with the base level unlocked for 50 Mythic Prisms. Your base skin will include one set of customizations, along with other cool features such as voice effects, voice interactions, animations, or unique VFX that make you stand out on the battlefield. Then, level up your Mythic hero skin with up to three more levels of customization. Each additional level requires 10 Prisms and will unlock access to additional cosmetic configurations, color options, and weapon styles. Skin levels need to be progressed and unlocked sequentially as you work your way to the top level and unlock all of the customizations for your Mythic hero skin. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/b40713eba08c87ca4b29b43973739a2d4c7ef378.png We look forward to hearing what you think as we continue to evolve this new feature and add new Mythic cosmetics to the game. Mythic Prisms and the Mythic Shop, along with the new Vengeance Mercy Mythic Hero Skin, is now live with Season 10, so pick up the Premium Battle Pass today and start collecting Mythic Prisms to unlock the Mythic hero skin you want.  F.A.Q. If I just want to get the Mythic hero skin, can I just purchase the Mythic hero skin directly? Mythic hero skins and customizations are unlocked with Mythic Prisms. The best way to unlock a Mythic hero skin and all that skin’s customizations is by upgrading and completing the Premium Battle Pass versus purchasing Mythic Prisms directly. You can unlock Premium Battle Pass with 1,000 Overwatch Coins or when you purchase the Ultimate Battle Pass bundle. How many Mythic Prisms will I earn through the completion of a Premium Battle Pass? You can earn 80 Mythic Prisms if you can complete the Premium Battle Pass, which is enough to unlock and fully customize the Mythic hero skin of your choice. What happens when I spend all of the Mythic Prisms from this season’s Premium Battle Pass, and I want to unlock more Mythic hero skins and customizations? The Premium Battle Pass is the best way as it always provides enough Mythic Prisms to unlock all levels of one Mythic hero skin per season. However, if you would like more Prisms to unlock an additional Mythic hero skin or customization, you can directly purchase additional Mythic Prisms in-game through the Battle.net shop or your game platform store. Can I only unlock new Mythic Hero Skins in the season they premiere in? Each season features a new Mythic hero skin to collect, but if you don’t unlock it by the time the season completes, they will be taken out of the shop for two seasons, and you will need to wait until the third season to have another chance to unlock and collect that skin. What happens if I unlock only a part of a new Mythic hero skin, like the Vengeance Mythic Mercy skin in Season 10, but the season ends? Can I still unlock parts of Vengeance Mythic Mercy right away? As long as you unlock the base Mythic hero skin (first level) while it is available in the Mythic shop, you will be able to unlock additional customizations even when the base Mythic hero skin is not available. If you do not unlock the base level of a season-featured Mythic hero skin before the season ends, you will need to wait two seasons before you can have another chance to unlock it. Can I unlock the level 4 customizations first, before the other levels? You can only unlock levels in sequential order as you upgrade your Mythic hero skin. This means level 1 must be unlocked before level 2, and so forth, each unlocking customizations including colors, armor configurations, and weapon styles. There is an option to “unlock all” levels at once when viewing a Mythic hero skin, which is available, providing you have enough Mythic Prisms to complete the unlock. Can I use Overwatch Coins or Credits to buy Mythic hero skins or upgrades? No, only Mythic Prisms can unlock Mythic hero skins and customizations, and Coins and Credits cannot be redeemed for Prisms. Can Mythic Prisms be used to unlock Legendary or other Overwatch content from the In-Game Shop or Hero Gallery? No, you must use Coins or Credits to unlock content from the In-Game Shop or Hero Gallery (the available content that can be collected with Overwatch Credits will vary). Can I earn Mythic Prisms from the free Battle Pass or through any Challenges? No. Mythic Prisms can only be earned by progressing through the Premium Battle Pass or through directly purchasing Prisms in game. How many levels of customization are there for Mythic hero skins? Most Mythic Hero Skins currently have three additional levels of customization after you unlock the base Mythic Hero Skin. ",

        "contents": "As we dig into Season 10 of Overwatch 2, we're thrilled to introduce our newest hero, Venture. We also have a first look at our new game mode, Clash, and updates to how you acquire new Heroes. So, get ready to embark on an epic excavation of greatness! You Can’t Spell Adventure without Venture Break ground with the newest Damage hero, Venture, a spirited archaeologist who channels their passion for history into daring acts of heroism. Armed with a massive drill and an arsenal of seismic abilities, Venture brings a fresh dynamic to the battlefield (and underneath it). Outwit your adversaries and unearth victory as you dive, dig, drill, and deliver massive damage in the process. Harnessing the power of their Smart Excavator, Venture primarily launches unstable seismic energy that explodes, and deals burst damage. With their Burrow ability, they can become invulnerable underground while gathering momentum for a calculated ambush upon re-emergence. Then use Drill Dash to dash forward to make some space as you knock opponents back. When you’re ready to totally obliterate anyone foolish enough to be in your path, Venture can unleash a massive shockwave with their Tectonic Shock Ultimate. Whether you’re traversing a covert subterranean path or bursting out to engage in close-quarter combat, Venture offers versatile gameplay that will wreak havoc on your adversaries. Dig Into the Battle with Venture and All Overwatch Heroes Right Away We want every player to be able to experience all the excitement that each hero has to offer. So, starting with Venture, all past, present, and future heroes will be unlocked immediately for everyone who has completed their new player experience. Also, since Venture got some fantastic field experience from their Hero Trial, we’ve made some adjustments to their kit, and we’re thrilled to share that we’ll be releasing Venture into Competitive right away when Season 10 begins tomorrow. This is a pretty major change from past heroes, but we’ve always wanted to allow new heroes into Competitive when a new season for Overwatch 2 launches. In the past, we wanted to make sure new heroes were free of any bugs or outstanding balance issues, as well as giving players enough time to unlock a hero from the Battle Pass. Because of the recent hero trial, and now unlocking all heroes, we’re confident Venture is ready to jump into the action right away. So, Venture forth and break some ground – all of it. So, Venture forth and break some ground – all of it. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/5f8ecb454d6b5e3844fb0faee7040f8de6012680.png Allegiances Change in Mirrorwatch Discover a world turned over in the reversed reality adventure, Mirrorwatch: a limited-time event set in a mirror universe where the virtuous have crumbled into villainy, and the wicked emerge as heroes. Swap alignments and experiment with reimagined Heroes and abilities like Strike Commander Doomfist’s Power Block shield, Vengeance Mercy's Soul Burn detonation, and Agent Colomar Sombra's Anti-Virus Ultimate. Twist reality further, taking the fight into a redesigned Watchpoint Gibraltar, where Talon has taken over. Explore this unique mirror universe for a limited time from April 23 to May 13. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/a908c5612497668e79339ccd05759c0e712c39a5.png New Ways to Earn and Unlock Rewards In response to your feedback, we're embarking on a journey to make it easier to earn rewards and give you more control over your Overwatch 2 experience. To that end, Coins are coming out of Weekly Challenges and going into the Battle Pass, making them easier to earn as you play. But that's not all – we’re pumping up the number of Coins you can earn per season, with up to 600 Overwatch Coins now available through the Battle Pass.  Choose Your Mythic Path In Season 10, we are introducing Mythic Prisms which will allow you to pick the Mythic hero skin of your choice.  The best way to collect Mythic Prisms is by upgrading to the Premium Battle Pass. The Mythic Prisms you collect can be used to unlock and upgrade Mythic hero skins and upgrade them with unlockable customizations. Once you conquer the Premium Battle Pass, you will have 80 Prisms, which is enough to fully unlock one complete Mythic skin, making this the best way to get Mythic Prisms every season.  This season, our newest Mythic hero skin is none other than Vengeance Mercy! Taking up the name “Vengeance,” Dr. Angela Ziegler leads Talon in a fight for a better world, where she wields full control over life and death. Mythic Vengeance Mercy will have three new color combinations and masks available, as well as two hair options and Caduceus Staff variations to unlock. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/33cc8a58ed588ce876e3c7e4e274780e996b8907.png Not a Mercy Main? Not a problem. You can also choose to spend your Mythic Prisms to pick up select previous Mythic hero skins like Mythic Cyberdemon Genji, Amaterasu Kiriko, and Galactic Emperor Sigma, or you can save them for new Mythic cosmetics that may appear in the shop in the future. Stay tuned for a deeper dive into Mythic Prisms, unlocks, progression, and more when Season 10 officially launches tomorrow. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/96e3f2f81ff889aa9ce6ba017aff936f5069e499.png Blur the Lines Between Good and Evil in the Battle Pass Evil is good and heroes have fallen: earn over 80 tiers of rewards when you pick up the Mirrorwatch-themed Season 10 Premium Battle Pass. Collect new Legendary skins including Agent Colomar Sombra, Junker Symmetra, Strike Commander Ogundimu Doomfist, Talon Brigitte, Captain Lacroix Widowmaker, and more. Step further into the mirror universe with the Ultimate Battle Pass Bundle, which is stacked with 2000 Overwatch Coins, 20 tier skips, plus the Fallen Knight Reinhardt and Arch-Commandant Amari Legendary skins. Clash for the Win Prepare for the adrenaline-pumping Clash game mode, a limited-time trial to start Season 10. This ultimate tug-of-war challenges teams to capture points along a linear path. With five capture points strategically placed on a mirrored map, teams must deftly maneuver to capture and defend points to clinch victory. Dynamic spawns and streamlined map routes expedite your return to the fight, maximizing time spent in the heat of battle. The Clash trial will allow you to explore Hanaoka, a brand-new map spanning an area within the beloved Hanamura district, offering fresh battlegrounds to conquer with a familiar feel. Don't miss out on the Clash trial, now available in the Arcade, from April 16 to April 29. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/9fd96b7fc23448fb476197f10c36615ab2293d9c.png Wreck and Roll with Hero Updates Wrecking Ball is rolling onto the scene with a few new upgrades to his kit. Wrecking Ball can now protect his teammates as you dive into the enemy lines and use Adaptive Shield, providing the option to transfer some of the additional shield health to nearby allies. Grappling Claw gets a new upgrade for greater control as you swing: now you can press primary fire while the claw is attached to the map terrain and retract Wrecking Ball for additional mobility. Lastly, Grappling Claw’s cooldown has been adjusted to be partially refunded if you don’t reach fireball speeds. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/a1ad41801cfc9b1293af9db454707de0c8f23b8f.png We also have a variety of other balance changes coming this season. Sombra and Tracer have been powerful picks since we introduced our core gameplay updates last season, so we’re toning down their kits. Sombra’s virus will have less damage dealt over time to help compensate for the initial burst damage, and Tracer’s Pulse bomb will now be more difficult to land on targets to level the field a bit when playing against her. Going into this season, many of our Tanks will receive small buffs to give heroes like Reinhardt more impact with abilities like Earthshatter. Finally, we’re shifting the power between damage and healing for some of our support heroes, including Moira and Illari, along with providing some buffs for Lifeweaver to better tune his kit. Check out these changes in detail in our Patch Notes preview on the forums.  Updates to Competitive and More We’ve got some major updates for Competitive Play - first up, you can now unlock any Golden Weapon with 2024 Competitive Points. Note you can’t spend the balance of your Legacy Competitive Points with your 2024 Points when redeeming for any Golden Weapon Variant though. We're making it easier for friends to play together in Competitive by removing grouping restrictions. Groups that have widely varied skill levels will be placed in a “Wide Group.” These Wide Groups will only ever play against other Wide Groups, meaning your matches may be a little sillier, take longer to queue, and you will receive less gains and losses to your rank after games. Solo players will never encounter wide groups, as you can only make a Wide Group of up to three people. Defense Matrix is getting an update, with new leaver penalty updates for both Unranked and Competitive modes. Finally, Streamer Protect now includes server-side features to hide your name from teammates and opponents in your games, instead of just covering your name in your own game client. Learn more about grouping restrictions, disruptive play mitigation, and other future updates in our recent Developer Update and our Defense Matrix blog. Fair and fun competitive play is a priority for our team, and we will continue to upgrade our Defense Matrix to mitigate disruptive play. Start your adventure and drill into the competition with this exciting new chapter in Overwatch 2. Log on tomorrow and unearth greatness in Season 10 firsthand. See you on (or underneath) the battlefield, heroes!",

        "contents": "Defense Matrix Update: Season 10 and Beyond Learn about upcoming changes to Overwatch that help get friends playing together while cutting down disruptive behavior. We’re back with a new Defense Matrix update on our efforts to keep Overwatch 2 a fun, safe, and inclusive experience for everyone. Our latest Developer Update revealed new features that aim to bring friends together while protecting you from disruptive players, so let’s dive a bit deeper into these changes and what you can expect in the coming seasons. Playing Competitive with Friends Overwatch 2 has always been a game best played with friends. However, in Competitive Play, it may not always work to group up if your friends are too far from your rank. That’s why we’re introducing “Wide Groups” in Season 10, and you’ll now be able to play with your friends in Competitive no matter their rank. So what, exactly, is a Wide Group? A Wide Group is when the highest and lowest ranked players are too far apart in Skill Tier and Divisions. Any groups with Diamond or lower ranked players that are more than five Skill Divisions apart are a Wide Group. Any groups with Masters players that are more than three Skill Divisions apart are also Wide Groups. Finally, any groups that have a Grand Masters or Champion Player are also Wide Groups regardless of how many Skill Divisions apart they are. With this new queue option comes some tradeoffs. For one, queue times will be longer as we work to pair you with other wide groups, using Role Delta tech to ensure the match is as close as possible. For example, a Wide Group with a Platinum player and Bronze player will be matched against another group with similar skill distribution to try and deliver the fairest match possible. However, some matches may not appear to be as balanced as you may encounter opponents who are very different in skill level than you are. Thankfully though, such encounters won’t necessarily have as much of an impact on your progress in the Competitive ranks. There will also be a new Modifier at the end of a match when playing in a Wide Group. It wouldn’t be fair for lower-skilled players to be directly boosted to higher ranks when they group with higher-skilled players, so some groups, depending on the skill gap, are likely to see little to no change in their skill progression. This helps ensure that high-skilled players don’t boost their lower-ranked friends. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/8dcd6da6c8da48ceea01482bda4378f2bb4220f4.png Solo players will only play with other solo players or “Narrow Groups,” ensuring they never play against any Wide Groups. This also means we won’t allow a Wide Group of four players to queue because solo players do not join matches with Wide Groups. This change should encourage players not to play on alternate accounts when they want to play with their friends. You can look forward to this new update for Competitive matchmaking to begin in Season 10. Update on Stopping Leavers We’ve already made adjustments to discourage leaving Unranked games of Overwatch, and there are a few more changes coming in Season 10. We’ve also taken a firm stance on leavers in Competitive Play and have a new update for that game mode as well. For Unranked games, players who leave four of their last 20 games played are put on cooldown for 20 minutes before they can queue again, with an increase to four hours if you leave at least six of their last 20 games. We’ll be adding two additional tiers: a five-minute penalty for leaving two of their last 20 games played, and a 48-hour suspension from queuing for any matchmaking mode for those who leave 10 (or more) out of their last 20 games played. Very few players deliberately leave 50% or more games, but we think this step will help further reduce the impact leavers can have in unranked Overwatch 2 games. To work back into good standing, Competitive now counts toward a player’s 20 games played. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/7b637f4556cda97942966b48f67b2b5760db9235.png Competitive Play is also receiving a notable addition to its penalty system for leaving games. Players can be suspended from Competitive Play whenever they leave any Competitive Play match. Penalties start off small at 15 minutes, but quickly escalate if they repeatedly leave games, and can even trigger a Season Ban, which will disqualify them for the remainder of that Competitive Season. When players complete several Competitive Matches, they’ll work back into good standing. Now we’re introducing a rule to Competitive Play that caps the total number of games you can leave in a season, regardless of how frequent it is. Players who leave 10 Competitive matches in a season will be immediately banned for the season. This should help curb those players who deliberately choose to leave a match, thinking they won’t have to deal with a lengthy suspension if they haven’t left their most recent games played. Remember, deliberately leaving or having a disconnection still counts as leaving. While we understand it is often not intentional, it still greatly impacts the high-stakes experience that Competitive provides. While any player can have a technical issue when playing, it's important not to jump back into Competitive Play until you are confident that any technical issue is resolved. If you need help troubleshooting disconnections or crashes, be sure to check out our support site. Expanding Streamer Protect Streamer Protect will now be called “Hide My Name” and will be an effective tool for all players, not just streamers. Last year, we introduced features that enabled players to hide their account information on their own client, with the goal of discouraging disruptive players from watching streamers and attempting to queue into that streamer’s game. However, this did not address harassment issues for players who are better known. When you activate Hide My Name, your BattleTag will appear as one of several dozen randomly generated BattleTags, ranging from Krusher99 to GarlicBread and many other fun references from Overwatch 2 and our community. This name will be displayed not only for your own game client but also for all other players in the lobby. After the match, players can see everyone’s actual BattleTags by checking the Social Menu. Don’t worry if you encounter disruptive players and are unsure if they are using a covered BattleTag. You can still report any player you encounter during and after the match, which will be reported to that player’s account. Expanding Avoid as Teammate “Avoid as Teammate” allows players the choice to not be paired with specific players on the same team when finding a match. This is a good way to step away from disruptive players, or players with a different playstyle than yours. In a future update, you’ll be able to add up to 10 players on your Avoid as Teammate list. For most players below Grand Masters, this will likely allow you to avoid all 10 players on your list. Those on the higher end of the ranked ladder may still see some of your avoided players that are lower in priority, especially when your queue time gets longer. The current Avoid as Teammate system allows you to avoid up to three players you encounter. This has been the maximum because adding more slots would make finding matches for players at higher ranks like Grand Master or Champion impossible. However, thanks to your feedback, we’re going to help give everyone more agency over which players they are paired with on their team. To better tailor your experience, you can toggle which players you absolutely don’t want to play with versus those you would rather avoid if you can help it. When your list is full, and you want to avoid a new player, they will be added automatically, dropping the player who’s been on the list the longest. Don’t worry—you can pin any players to ensure they don’t fall off your list. This will enable a smoother user experience and allow you to get back in the queue faster. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/856a4ba392942578297e5c5b30c51c0be4cd69f9.png Mitigating Disruptive Chat We never consider it acceptable for anyone to harass, insult, or abuse any other player through chat. We’ve already taken many steps to identify disruptive chat faster and take action in cases of clearly identified disruptive chat, and soon we’ll have more updates to improve the chat experience for all players. When a player is actioned for disruptive chat or not playing fairly in the game, we demote their Endorsement Rating to “Level 0.” Even new players start at Level 1, so you can only reach this level if you are actioned for breaking the Blizzard In-Game Code of Conduct. Coming later this year, we are going to prevent anyone with a Level 0 Endorsement Rating from using any text or voice chat in their matches. These privileges can be restored once the player reaches Level 1 again, which is done by playing your best, helping your team, and communicating with the in-game ping system. We also recognize that some players like being disruptive to others while they spectate their friends' matches. Since it’s not possible to report spectators who are disruptive on console platforms, and very limited on PC, access to team and match chat channels will be removed. Friends can still chat with each other through a Whisper. Faster Reporting Every day, we work to action disruptive players and correct inappropriate behavior in our games, and your reports help us with this. However, we understand it's not easy to report when you are in the middle of a match. We’re designing an easier-to-use interface that should enable all players to report as soon as they see disruptive behavior, and we look forward to sharing more later this year. Remember, when you report a player as being abusive in either text or voice chat as soon as possible, it's easier for our system to better identify that player’s disruptive behavior. To learn more about how to report players in Overwatch, see our support article. Introducing Player Surveys We’re always watching for your feedback, whether it be on social media, through communities from our top content creators, or other places of note. As we continue striving to make Overwatch 2 a safer and more inclusive experience for all players, we’re providing a new way for players to help make their voices heard. We’ll be introducing new player surveys into Overwatch 2. We’ll randomly choose players whenever they complete a match after the end-of-match flow, including the Play of the Game and your progression updates. If you are selected, you will be prompted by a new splash screen with an invitation to participate in an optional survey that you can access by clicking the link or scanning the QR code on your phone. You’ll have your chance to let us know what you think about new modes, events, and features, along with telling us how we can help protect you from disruptive players. We look forward to seeing your participation when we launch this feature in a future update. Thanks for Playing Together To recap, our change to grouping up with friends in Competitive, Leaver Penalties updates, and our improved Streamer Protect will launch in Season 10.  The other features (and more!) will be coming in the following seasons. We’ll be back with more updates later, so stay tuned as we continue to work on stopping cheating and promote good teamwork in every match of Overwatch 2. Thanks, everyone, and let’s have a great game! ",

        "contents": "Hello! It’s been a while since my last blog – but we’ve been hard at work! Let’s get right into it! First off, I am thrilled that you have welcomed our newest hero, Venture, to the line-up. Venture’s ecstatic personality has charmed many of you, and you have already asked us so many questions about their backstory and personality. While I am unsure if they like to munch on rocks, they have drilled their way to being the top-picked hero in Quick Play this past weekend. We’ll be revealing more about Venture’s story and how they were developed shortly after Season 10 launches. One of the biggest reasons so many of us instantly fell in love with Venture is the incredible voice talent of Valeria Rodriguez. We instantly knew they were a hit when we saw how much energy they could put into their voice and how they matched Venture’s personality perfectly. We are also thrilled that many of you have welcomed Valeria into our community. Watching all of your reactions from the hero trial, we’re pretty happy with how Venture’s initial kit turned out.  The team was really happy with where Venture landed from a balance perspective during the trial, and it gave us confidence that they could release early into Competitive. We’re still deciding how early, but we feel they are in a suitable state (fun to play and fair to play against). While we don’t foresee needing to make many changes to their kit, we’re going to be listening closely to your thoughts on how Venture is doing in-game. We’ve heard a lot of feedback that you like the tempo momentum Venture brings, being able to engage and disengage in fights.  But we’re looking at tweaking a few things for Venture at the start of Season 10. First, we’re slightly shifting some of their burst damage from their Drill Dash and Clobber (their melee) into damage over time. Next, we’re looking to reduce the vertical knockback of Tectonic Shock. Alongside those minor changes to Venture, we have a number of other hero changes coming in Season 10. Starting with our Tanks, we're upping the impact of Junker Queen's Carnage and Reinhardt's Earthshatter, so both abilities cut through better in the post-Season 9 world. The biggest Tank changes coming into Season 10 though are for Wrecking Ball. There are some great improvements to Wrecking Ball's Grappling Hook, including a reduced cooldown when not entering ramming speed and the ability to retract himself to where the Grapple is attached by holding down Primary Fire or Jump. There are also some changes to Adaptive Shields. Now after using Adaptive Shields, you can reactivate the ability to transfer up to 300 overhealth to nearby allies, capped at 75 overhealth per ally. This change should give Wrecking Ball more capability of protecting his allies and initiating engagements, defining features of what we want to see in Tanks. For our Damage heroes, there will be some light adjustments for Sombra and Tracer. Sombra's Virus damage is taking a small hit on the damage over time amount (100 to 90) since the ability now has more upfront burst. Tracer has been quite strong since the Season 9 changes--she's one of the least touched heroes in OW's history, her kit flows spectacularly well! We are looking at some light changes for her right now, to make her slightly more punishable and require more precision. Moving on to Support, we are looking at shifts in power for Moira, Lucio, and Illari. That means taking power from one part of their kit and funneling it into another - to somewhat maintain the overall power budget of the hero. Illari, for example, is receiving a slight nerf to her Primary Fire recovery time - 0.2 to 0.25 seconds - but giving more power back to her Secondary Fire heal and increase its HPS from 105 to 115. There are also some light buffs for Lifeweaver as we continue to evaluate where healthy power can be injected into his kit. Many of you may have seen the recent Developer Update this month, and we’re just as excited as you are for those changes, including heroes no longer being locked behind the Battle Pass. We’re incredibly excited about Season 10, and we’ve got some more changes that will make Overwatch more fun for everyone next season and throughout the year. We’ll have another Developer Update coming out tomorrow, which will touch on things we’re doing for Competitive and updates on what we’re doing to help make Overwatch a more safe and inclusive experience for everyone. So, I hope you’ll check it out. That’s all I got for now. We can’t wait to see all of you jump into Season 10, which begins April 16. Thanks, and let’s make a great game! ",

        "contents": "Greetings, heroes! We have big updates on the horizon we're excited to share with you. Hero Releases Let's kick things off with the stars of our game – the heroes. Starting Season 10, all new heroes will be immediately unlocked when they launch. All existing heroes will also be unlocked for players. This means that heroes will no longer need to be unlocked through the Battle Pass to be playable in all game modes.       New players will still need to complete the first-time user experience to unlock heroes as they learn the ropes. Once the heroes from the original Overwatch roster have been unlocked, all Overwatch 2 heroes will also become available. Last year at BlizzCon, we gave a sneak peek at our 40 th hero, Venture, showcasing their unique underground mechanics and daring, adventurous spirit. We’re excited to share that all players will have immediate access to Venture when they officially join the Overwatch 2 lineup in Season 10.   Mythic Changes We want to provide you with more control over how you earn Mythic hero skins. Season 10 will introduce changes to how you earn, upgrade, and unlock Mythic hero skins through the new Mythic Shop. The Mythic Shop will allow you to work towards past and current seasonal Mythic hero skins as you progress through the Premium Battle Pass. You get to decide how far into each Mythic skin you would like to build. So, for example, if you don't want to fully unlock all of a skin's color or model variations, you can spread your progression towards other Mythic hero skins. We’re also adding past Mythic hero skins to the Mythic Shop, giving you the opportunity to pick up your favorites. Seasonal Mythic hero skins will be available two seasons after their debut. This means Mythic hero skins from Seasons 1 through 7 will be available in the Mythic Shop starting Season 10.  We’ll share more information on the Mythic Shop and additional changes to the Premium Battle Pass as we get closer to Season 10. Challenges and Coins Starting Season 10, you will earn coins as you progress through the Free and Premium tracks of the Battle Pass, making them easier and more consistent to earn. We’re also increasing the number of coins you can earn for free from 540 to 600 coins per season. Weekly challenges will be more flexible to fit with your playstyle, and they will now reward Battle Pass XP. Keeping Gameplay Fresh Beyond heroes and customization, we’re also continuing to look at ways to refresh the core of Overwatch 2's gameplay. Season 9 saw big changes to Competitive and core gameplay mechanics. Our vision in the long term is to maintain a regular heartbeat in the game by consistently introducing new or updated systems, shaking up the meta, implementing rank resets, and introducing new rewards. We’re looking at how often this happens and listening closely to your feedback. We're committed to making Overwatch 2 as fair, fun, and competitive as possible. More Maps to Explore We’re excited to share plans on how we release and update maps. The brand-new mode we introduced at BlizzCon 2023, Clash, will make its debut this year with two accompanying maps. Get ready for intense action in the limited-time Clash trial on the new Hanaoka map at the start of Season 10. We’re excited to hear your feedback. Season 11 will introduce Runasapi, the new Push map set against the stunning backdrop of Peru in the world of Illari and the Inti Warriors. We're reworking some existing maps as well. Season 11 will also bring a reworked Colosseo. We’ve been listening to your feedback on Dorado, Circuit Royale, Havana, and Numbani. We’re working on significant updates for these maps, so keep letting us know what other maps you would like us to look at in the future. verwatch 2 is evolving every season, and your feedback is a huge part of that evolution. As we approach Season 10 and beyond, the team is committed to delivering a fun experience for everyone. Stay tuned for another Developer Update closer to Season 10 that covers upcoming competitive and Defense Matrix updates including how we’re addressing disruptive player behavior, grouping restrictions and competitive, and player anonymity. Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey – let's make a great game! ",

You can acquire new upgrades when you obtain energy by defeating the attack bots throughout the course. Upgrades can include the ability to repair your towers or activate turrets that can help defend your towers. What upgrades you encounter are randomized, making every game unique. Maximize Your Score Build your score and earn bonuses when you can keep your towers standing and/or undamaged. How many bots you can eliminate and how well you can land critical hits or support your team will determine how high you can score.

        "contents": "Hello, wonderful people, and welcome to the mid-Season 9 Director's Take! This season had the most significant changes to the game that we've made in a long time. When we launched Season 9 in February, we wanted to make sure to keep an eye on your feedback and react to what we saw. We've had two patches so far, and we have another one, which is quite the stunner, coming up next week. Let's get into that… no, wait! ...Let's talk about where we're at… and then get into that. The changes made this season were designed to address multiple issues in the game, based largely in part on your feedback. We're happy with how these modifications have shifted the game, but there are two areas we want to improve a bit: the Damage passive, and how some individual heroes have landed after the shakeup. We think the direction we’re heading in is correct but agree that some changes still need to be ironed out. Let's start with the Damage passive. It's had quite a big impact on the game. It was designed to push our Damage heroes to the forefront of a fight. In terms of securing kills, it's definitely doing this. Overwatch is about eliminating the opponents and sending them back to spawn, so we think it's healthy for Damage heroes to have a large impact here… but it may be pushed a bit too far. There can be moments where it feels a bit too dangerous, even as a Tank, to expose yourself, or where your health can burn down quicker than expected while being healed. One of the goals of the recent health increase was to soften some of the burst damage in the game. This is one of those effects that can be very difficult to tune just right, so we're going to take a small step back in the next patch and lessen the healing reduction from 20% to 15%. We'll keep an eye on it and go from there. With balance, we're touching roughly half the heroes in the roster in this patch. The power of heroes moved around a lot this season, and while we think this type of change can be healthy for the game, we'd still like to make sure that all heroes feel viable. We'll release the full set of patch notes in a few days, but I'd like to get into a few of the more notable changes that we're making here. On the Support side, we're making a fairly significant buff to Ana's grenade. Its damage and healing will move from 60 to 90 health to give her more self-survivability. Ana is an interesting hero, and one of the most played in the entire game. So, we're hoping that this adjustment brings her to a place where she feels viable but not dominant. We're also making a few adjustments to Lifeweaver to help with his healing burst potential . His maximum heal will increase from 70 to 80, with the maximum charge increasing from 1 to 1.15 seconds. Along with the reduced Damage role passive, we think both he and Mercy will be more reliable moving forward. Doomfist and Mauga are two of the Tanks getting a tune up. Meteor Strike's minimum damage will increase from 15 to 50. While this might not seem like a big change, the amount of damage this Ultimate does scales from the edge of its effect to the center and should result in a lot more guaranteed damage. Ultimately, we want Meteor Strike to give Doomfist or his team the ability to follow it up and secure eliminations more reliably. Mauga is getting changes to his Cardiac Overdrive ability: its duration will decrease from 5 to 4 seconds, and its cooldown will decrease from 12 to 10 seconds. Additionally, it will fill his passive overhealth by 100. We want the ability to be more reliable and more consistently give Mauga additional survivability. Mauga will also receive a buff to his Overrun: the Stomp damage will increase from 45 to 60. A Tank we are not touching in this patch is Wrecking Ball, but we have a small rework coming to our loveable-yet-deranged, hamster in Season 10. Expect all of these changes and more to go live for our Midseason Update next Tuesday, March 12. I’d like to reiterate that we’ll be watching the game and listening to your feedback when these changes go live and react accordingly. In fact, we’re already talking about some of the modifications that we’ll be making in Season 10. We're also going to be running our next Quick Play: Hacked later this season. This one is called Double Trouble and it removes the one hero limitation in game. Role Queue will still be active, but this means that players can choose two of the same hero for both Damage and Support roles. The hero limit was something that was implemented in Overwatch early into the original launch. At the time we didn’t have Role Queue in the game, and players could create a team of five Winstons and a Support. We called this strategy the “Quinston” and it won our first internal tournament! However, now that we do have Role Queue in the game, the possibility of creating comps like this is gone. Giving players more freedom in which hero they choose and more creativity in putting comps together could be great… we can’t wait to see what you come up with! That's it for this update. We're looking forward to next week's patch, and let's make a great game! ",

        "contents": "Hi everyone, and Happy Friday! :) It's been a very exciting week and a half for Overwatch 2! Season 9: Champions shipped with a new and improved version of our Competitive system and a pretty comprehensive set of changes to the core mechanics of our game. We're incredibly invested in these changes having a positive impact on the game and are committed to making rapid iterations to them to make that happen. In fact, earlier this week, we made our first pass at tuning with a set of refined projectile sizes and health changes for some of our heroes. We'll keep an eye on how these play out in order to inform you of our next set of changes. Let's talk about the reworked Competitive Play system, which also launched with Season 9. There's been a lot of excitement around it. In fact, there's been a pretty sizeable shift in our player population because of it. Previously, Quick Play was the most popular mode in Overwatch. It accounted for roughly 40% of the total match hours in the game, while Competitive Play sat at around 35%. Those numbers have since shifted, and Competitive Play now makes up about 45% of match hours, with Quick Play around 32%. An interesting thing to note here is that the total number of hours that people are playing Quick Play isn't down; it's just that people are playing a lot more Competitive Play! We're really excited about this and take it as confirmation that people would like to see more changes and improvements to that side of the game, as well as systemic PvP improvements. Speaking of improvements, we'll be making more changes in mid-Season 9 and Season 10. One of the largest of these will include the removal of grouping restrictions in Season 10. We'd like people to be able to play with their friends in every area of the game, however we'd also like to keep Overwatch's competitive integrity intact. Groups with a large range of player skill—what we call wide groups—will only play against other wide groups. Narrow groups will only be matched with other narrow groups. For most players we think this will have a big benefit to their match quality. We'll also be adding features to the Competitive Progress screen, such as Match History and a Scorecard, implementing role-specific titles, showing the rank range on the scoreboard, and more. We're also looking into a small set of Top 500 improvements but haven't nailed down which season they'll go live yet. Lastly, I'd like to take a quick moment to talk about our Quick Play: Hacked feature. The biggest goal is to help inform the types of improvements we could make to the core game. For instance, based on the first one we ran, Quicker Play, we're looking at making a few changes to the game. We'll be increasing the speed of the Push bot when he's pushing the barrier. We're implementing a speed boost out of spawn for Flashpoint maps, as well as during setup for defenders on Hybrid and Escort modes. We’ll also be reducing the match length of Push from 10 minutes to 8 minutes in Quick Play and are discussing whether to do that in Competitive. We received a lot of feedback on the way we ran the first event, and I'd like to take a moment to address some of it. The first question that people asked was why we would run this mode in Quick Play rather than something like our old Experimental Card, which was originally created for this purpose. The truth is that the Experimental card was never popular enough for us to get the type of data we wanted from it. Only about 18% of our players joined this queue, and out of those, the overwhelming majority would only play 1 match before going back to their preferred modes. We'd like to get longer-term data and feedback on these tests than what Experimental was giving us. It's difficult for anyone, devs or players, to make an assessment of a game-wide change in just one match. The other piece of feedback we heard was that big disruptive changes to Quick Play didn't give players an option of playing their favorite mode if they didn't like those changes. Based on what we heard, we will change the way we run Quick Play: Hacked for future events. When we want to test things that have the potential of being fairly disruptive, we'll run the mode on a separate card next to Quick Play. When we want to test something that is a little more moderate, we will probably take over Quick Play but do it for a shorter period of time during the week. And when we have a test that we feel has little disruption to the core game, we'll probably run it the same way we did the original. That's it for this week. Hope everyone is having a blast in Season 9. Thanks for reading, and let's make a great game! ",

        "contents": "WELCOME TO SEASON 9: CHAMPIONS Season 9 brings core gameplay updates, a reworked Competitive game mode, and a new Co-op event that will test the courage of even the bravest heroes as they face a dangerous threat of cosmic proportions. NEW EVENT: COSMIC CRISIS Face off against eldritch abominations in the twisted reality of Cosmic Crisis, a brand-new co-op mission. Work with three other players to repair your ship and escape the ruins of Ecopoint Antarctica while fighting off the monstrous Null Sector. But keep an eye out for your teammates… an ancient power lurks in the shadows, waiting for its chance to strike. COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES Developer Comments: With your feedback, we’ve made new improvements to Competitive Play that aim to provide more transparency into your progress after every match, plus we introduced a new skill tier and new Competitive Rewards to earn. Skill Rank Reset Given the significant changes to our heroes and the addition of a new skill tier, this reset is designed to give all players a chance to climb higher than ever before. All roles in Role Queue and Open Queue in Competitive Play have been reset to Unranked. Placement Matches Placements have been rebuilt from the ground up. Your predicted rank will be displayed after each placement match. You must complete 10 matches in a role to receive your Skill Rank for that role. Winning your placements will have a significant impact on your final rank. Competitive Updates Competitive Updates have been reworked. Instead of requiring five wins or 15 losses to get a Competitive Update, updates now happen after every match. Going forward, the Competitive Updates page now hosts information about your ranks in Role Queue and Open Queue, as well as your progress toward Competitive Point rewards. Skill Modifiers Modifiers now appear on the Competitive Progress page after each match. Skill modifiers provide information on how much a rank will gain or lose progress after a match, including win or loss streaks, rank instability, and match favorability. New Skill Tier - Champion A new rank has been added above Grandmaster, called Champion, that is more exclusive than any other rank in Overwatch. Only an exceedingly small percentage of players will ever occupy this echelon of Competitive Play. Versus Screen The range of ranks for players in a match of Competitive Play is now displayed on the same screen where both teams are shown with their name cards, player icons, and titles. New Grouping Requirements Bronze through Diamond Players may group with other players within 2 Skill Tiers of their own Skill Rank. Master players may group with other players within 1 Skill Tier of their own Skill Rank. Grandmaster players may group with other players within 3 Skill Divisions of their own Skill Rank. Champion players may group with only one other player within 3 Skill Divisions of their own Skill Rank. Art & UI Updates Skill Tier and Skill Division art for rank icons have been redesigned for improved readability. The Competitive Skill Tier legend has been redesigned to include updated and new relevant information. Competitive Points Each win now grants 10 Competitive Points. Each draw now grants 5 Competitive Points. Each loss still grants 0 Competitive Points. Competitive Progression Competitive Challenges that award additional Competitive Points at the end of the season have been replaced with a new Competitive Progression system. Every match grants progress toward your Competitive Progression meter, and after earning 30 you will receive an additional 100 Competitive Points. Wins award 3 progress toward your Competitive Progression meter. Draws and Losses award 1 progress. Competitive Rewards Jade Weapon Variants have been introduced. Each Jade Weapon Variant costs 3000 Competitive Points to purchase. All players will start this season with a balance of 0 Competitive Points. All existing Competitive Points have been converted into a new currency, Legacy Competitive Points. Each Golden Weapon Variant now costs 3000 Competitive Points to purchase. At the end of a Competitive Year, any remaining balance of Competitive Points converts to Legacy Competitive Points. Matchmaking Rating At the start of this season only, the internal Matchmaking Ratings for all players have been adjusted to push players closer to the normalized average (approximately at Gold 3). Matchmaking Ratings have been decayed. The higher the rank, the more it has been decayed. Most players will start at a lower skill rank and division than their most recent rank. Competitive Challenges Competitive challenges removed. Rewards and progress for Competitive Play are now displayed on the Competitive Progress page and titles are rewarded at the end of the season. GENERAL UPDATES PLAYER PROGRESSION Added a new set of visual upgrades. Hero/Game Mode badge upgrades start at Level 500. Progression Level badge upgrades start at Level 2500. Wrecking Ball title rewards are renamed from \"Champion\" to \"Champ\" to align with Junker Queen's usage of the title (and to avoid confusion with the new Champion rank). Adjusted amount needed to level up certain sub-badges for Mauga and Illari. FRIEND ENDORSEMENTS The endorsement is only eligible if you're in the match for a set duration. Endorsements are subject to the configured cooldown period of 12 hours. Endorsements are subject to cooldown even if you unfriend the recipient. SETTINGS Added a feature for controller/keyboard users that remembers what you had focus when backing out of screens. CROSSHAIR UPDATE New Reticle Types have been added. Square Box Line Triwing Falloff New Reticle Dots have been added. Ring Square Triangle Cross Heart New Reticle color options have been added. Brown Dark Red Light Red Light Purple Gray Teal HERO UPDATES GENERAL Developer Comments: Season 9 features changes to the fundamentals of Overwatch 2 gameplay that affect every hero. We’ve heard the community feedback around some gameplay pain points, and these changes are in response to many of those. Most damage-dealing projectile sizes have been increased by a new global modifier added to their base size. +0.05 meters for hitscan projectiles with a high rate of fire or spread (e.g., Tracer's Pulse Pistols or Reaper's Hellfire Shotguns). +0.08 meters for hitscan projectiles that are more precise (e.g., Cassidy's Peacekeeper or Soldier:76's Heavy Pulse Rifle). +0.05 meters for travel time projectiles that are shotguns or have a very high rate of fire (e.g., Roadhog's Scrap Gun or Ramattra's Void Accelerator). +0.10 meters for travel time projectile with a speed greater than 50 meters per second (e.g., Zenyatta's Destruction Orb). +0.15 meters for travel time projectile with a speed less than or equal to 50 meters per second (e.g., Pharah's Rocket Launcher).

Added vertical beam at second choke point to promote movement out of the upper floor & make the choke easier to defend. Widened and added cover in a hallway in the third area to make close quarter fights easier to maneuver. Developer Comments: We've added more cover—including new structures—to help counter some of the long sightlines around the first checkpoint.

Team up with friends and face tactical moments requiring both individual and collective skill. Every time you play will be a fresh experience with variations in enemy waves, objectives, and upgrade options, ensuring no two games are the same and that you can test your skill with any hero. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/9c6fd79cd119cc41d5395ef456199e7ddbbac1d1.png Bringing a Whole New Balance to Gameplay Season 9: Champions also introduces global balance changes that affect every hero in the game. We're adjusting how the damage dealt is more consistent by increasing the projectile size while also increasing the health pools of all heroes, thereby keeping the time it takes to eliminate targets relatively the same. We also added a new passive for all heroes to regenerate their health when they step out of combat. If you haven’t already, read up on the full details of these changes in our previous blog or check out our patch notes. Justice Rains From Above Season 9 also presents significant updates to Pharah, made with some strong goals in mind: Empower Pharah to make more individual plays and lessen her reliance on heroes like Mercy.  Shift Pharah's movement capabilities from feathering up in the sky toward more horizontal movement that can cover distance quickly. Introduce brief moments of downtime for Pharah's flight. These goals are aimed at enabling Pharah to be more effective at higher ranked thresholds and as a solo hero, while also addressing rougher experiences players have going against Pharah - such as her presence limiting the effective hero pool of the opposing team. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/c6c5ed39a86e045c073435c1e003022f9c86cba9.png Pharah’s Hover Jets passive has been reworked to limit her time in the air, with fuel being recharged only while she is touching the ground. To compensate for this large change, Pharah has more speed and acceleration while in the air, allowing her to traverse between areas quicker. Jump Jets also now provide bonus fuel (50% of the total tank) and that overflows if you hit 100% fuel. So, while there are moments of downtime introduced, Pharah players will have much more control of where they want to be on the battlefield during that time in air. Pharah also has a new ability called Jet Dash. When Pharah uses Secondary Fire she will dash in the direction she's moving. When combined with Concussive Blast and the enhanced mobility from Hover Jets, Pharah can quickly navigate herself into positions where she's highly lethal. This more active Pharah means a healthier game and offers new levels of skill expression. We’re looking forward to your feedback on these Pharah changes. Rolling into Junkertown And finally, a big update for the wild and rowdy Junkertown map is coming this season. The first section of the map (the area by the first checkpoint) is quite open. It can be tough for the offensive team to push the cart through here if the defending team has a Widow or Pharah. So, we’ve replaced the small cover with a trusty, burned-out building. We’ve also replaced the outhouse that was close to the gate with a tall water tower to block the line of sight from the openings above the choke point. Additionally, a few more cars have been added to this area, and the cliffside path has been reduced. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/78155c7209f34deae0e836e03168c091782e6f9a.png The small health pack on the balcony overlooking the hairpin turn on the second area has been removed to lessen the defender advantage from that choke. In the third area, we added a vertical support beam on the left side of the hallway to block the sightline from the upper ledge to give more cover for attackers to enter the area. We also widened and added cover to a hallway on the outer mid-section of area 3 to open up team fights that happen there. Finally, the updated map features a new night-time lighting theme to try out. Overwatch 2 – Season 9: Champions begins tomorrow, so answer the call and challenge yourself on the Competitive ranks today. ",

        "contents": "As many of you know, two weeks ago, there were a series of changes made to the Overwatch team, as well as other teams across Blizzard. Writing a public blog is difficult in the wake of these events. I want to express gratitude for the absolutely amazing people who worked on our game that are no longer on our team. I want the community to feel informed, and I want to convey our excitement about what is to come in Season 9. To be honest, it’s a lot to balance – but one of the things we’ve been most proud of is how we’ve kept lines of communication open between the team and our community, and we intend to continue that. In that spirit, yesterday, we shared the exciting changes you are going to experience with Competitive starting in Season 9. I’d like to give a bit more insight into why we are making these changes. In our previous Director's Take, we talked about improving the game’s core PvP experience. There are different ways that we look at improving the game, but one of the biggest is listening to your feedback. Season 9 starts in less than a week, and the two biggest and best changes coming to the season and a lot of it is driven by feedback from you – our players along with our team’s vision to make the game more fun and challenging for everyone. The first is the reworked Competitive system, and there is a lot of improvements to rank transparency, new skill tiers, and new competitive rewards. We started talking publicly about this in September when we referenced a video that summarized many of the problems that existed with the current system. Some of these were:  Updates to a player's rank were too infrequent. It was difficult to understand why a player ranked up or down and by how much. Some divisions, like GM1, had players with too large a range of skill in them. Golden Weapons were no longer appealing. Our top goal with this rework is to make the system easier to understand. The old system hid too much information from players and gave it to them too infrequently. This is why we’re updating your rating after every match as well as including additional information, through modifiers, about why your rating went up or down a certain amount. Including the division range of all the players on the VS screen is another way that we’re trying to give you more information about a particular match. With the system being easier to understand, players will have more incentive to get better and climb the ranks. We’d like players to have this incentive and the opportunity to earn new rewards. Competitive points will now be awarded more consistently as opposed to a large drop at the end of a season, and you can use them to unlock our new Jade weapons! There’s also a whole new, incredibly exclusive tier above Grandmaster, called Champion. We've already started receiving feedback on the system and are planning a series of improvements giving more information about player skill in a match, allowing players from different divisions to play with each other more easily, and improvements to the Top 500 experience. Some of these should start rolling out in the middle of Season 9 and continue consistently after that. Season 9 will also include a really large set of exciting changes to the overall gameplay of Overwatch - not just in the form of balance to heroes but in some of the core mechanics of the game too. These changes are meant to address a few common topics we hear from the community: Make shooting feel better and more consistent. Reduce the effectiveness of both burst damage and in-combat healing. Give Damage heroes more agency in securing eliminations. We've made changes to address each one of these. We've added health to all heroes in the game in order to reduce the effect of burst damage, as well as reduce the number of heroes that can effectively one-shot each other. In addition, we've made most of the projectiles in the game slightly larger, which makes it easier to land a shot on other players. This was partially done to compensate for the health increase - to spread damage out to make it feel more consistent. Additionally, Overwatch is a fast-paced game, our heroes are incredibly nimble, and landing shots can feel inconsistent. We've also added a new passive to the Damage Role that decreases healing done to players that they've damaged recently. The idea here is to give Damage players an increased ability to secure kills as well as to mitigate the abilities of Support heroes to keep targets alive. This should also give Damage heroes an advantage when facing off against Supports. This is an impressive set of changes that will shake up the meta in all sorts of thrilling ways. The team will be following the launch of Season 9 very closely and is planning on doing quick updates based on what we see… and the feedback that we get from all of you! Speaking of feedback, there are a few other systems that players have been talking about recently that we'll respond to in future Director's Takes and blog pieces this season. The first is our Quick Play: Hacked event, and we'll have more updates in the weeks and months to come. I can't wait to share our thoughts on those with all of you. On the Overwatch team, we end our weekly meetings by saying “Let’s make a great game.” It’s a recognition that everyone on the team has the ability to influence our game and make it better. We’ve always worked to incorporate feedback from all of you into the development of the game. So, it’s fitting that in light of all the changes we’re making to our game, based off of all the feedback we hear, that we start including all of you in our team’s pledge. Thanks for reading, and let’s make a great game! ",

        "contents": "The newest season of Overwatch 2 is just around the corner, and with it comes some exciting improvements. During our Overwatch 2: What’s Next Panel at BlizzCon 2023, we shared a sneak peek at some of the philosophy guiding many of the system changes coming this year: striving to make PvP gameplay more rewarding and fun and providing greater transparency for players in-game. We are introducing major changes to Competitive in the new season—from a new progression system to an all-new skill tier above Grand Master—as well as major gameplay changes to combat and hero survivability. Read for details on what you can expect for Overwatch 2 Season 9: Champions. Updating the Competitive Experience We’ve heard your feedback on Competitive Play over the last eight seasons, and we have some big updates coming that will give you the opportunity to build on your skills and see how you progress through the Competitive ranks. We built a better system that’s more accurate while also helping convey the meaning behind the mathematical complexity of a modern matchmaker and bring clear insights about what impacts your rank in every match. Seeing How and Why Your Rank Changes One piece of feedback we heard is that just knowing your rank doesn’t say anything about why your rank went up or down. Competitive Updates originally worked to provide updates that reflected your growth as a player across multiple matches, but with the goal to provide greater transparency in each individual match, we’re going back to updating your rank after every match and showing how much progress you gain or lose between each Skill Division. We’re also displaying Modifiers that affected your last match below the rank progression bar. Some modifiers help provide transparency in the matchmaking for each match, like getting a boost when you defeat a team that was more favored to win. While other modifiers show if your rank is calibrating, like going on a huge win streak, proving you belong in a higher rank. Feedback is a driving force behind these changes, and we want to hear your thoughts on Competitive Play now that you’ll have more context for each game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/1a96320990aba441240082ae92525db4c61189db.png Bring a Fresh Start with Placement Matches and Rank Resets With both the changes to Competitive Play and the broader changes to gameplay starting this season, we feel this is a perfect opportunity for everyone to start fresh as they compete on the ranked leaderboards. To accomplish this, we’re reintroducing Placement Matches and resetting everyone’s competitive Skill Rank.  Your journey to the top begins with 10 all-new Placement Matches. With everyone’s ranks being reset, these 10 Placement Matches provides you with a high-stakes opportunity to make big gains in determining your new starting rank. As you progress through placement matches, there will be a predicted starting rank after each match. You’ll only have one chance this year to run your Placement Matches, so pick your best heroes and stay hydrated because these games count for a lot. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/0d9f3640bd23a6bdafaa1558a4818a8b81bae220.png Rise up to the Rank of Champion So how high can you go? We’re introducing the ultimate rank, Champion. This is the most prestigious tier above Grandmaster, intended to show who is the best among the most skilled players in the game. Even with the boosts that Placement Matches can provide, top-ranking players will still need to win a lot of games to reach Champion 1 and prove they are the best of the best. This is the most exclusive rank in the history of Overwatch, and we’re on the edge of our seats to see who will achieve such heights in Season 9 and beyond. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/a0e1ade5c09e531afb9f947c56de3de1c9a849fd.png New Competitive Rewards and Jade Weapons Season 9 introduces Jade Weapon Variants, unlockable with new 2024 Competitive Points. Earning Jade Weapon Variants will reflect your dedication to Competitive Play in 2024, not your highest rank achieved. Luckily, these new Jade Weapon Variants will not be as exclusive as the Champion rank—you will progress towards earning competitive points just by playing the game mode, with more progress granted towards wins. Competitive points earned for winning and drawing a match have been rebalanced around this new progression system, which should make every match feel rewarding regardless of the outcome. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/c558a007ee6cd228cfc4f2ffdb638b1c8887cc8c.png Legacy Competitive Points and Golden Weapons Through the end of Season 8, players can still earn Competitive Points toward unlocking Golden Weapon Variants. When Season 9 starts, your previously earned Competitive Points will be converted to Legacy Competitive Points. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/a62aad8abc710538a98125a57792dab941f73208.png You’ll still be able to use Legacy Competitive Points to unlock the Golden Weapon Variants, but the way you receive Legacy Competitive Points will change. Once the 2024 Competitive Year closes, any leftover 2024 Competitive Points will automatically be converted and added to your Legacy Competitive Points, which can be used to unlock Golden Weapon Variants. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/6a97b25fea69215685996a0a05a74af8eb3209de.png Last Chance to Claim End-of-Season Bonuses Starting in Season 9, Competitive Challenges that grant bonus Competitive Points are also changing. Season 8 will be the last season to claim end-of-season Competitive Challenges for Seasons 1-7 Log in before the end of Season 8 to grab any rewards from Season 7 or earlier that you haven’t claimed yet. Once Season 9 begins, you will be unable to receive past Competitive Points from completed Competitive Challenges from Season 7 or earlier. You’ll still be able to claim your Season 8 rewards during Season 9, but you must log in to receive that bonus before the end of Season 9. Introducing Changes to Core Gameplay Beyond the Competitive Rework, Season 9 features major changes to the fundamentals of Overwatch 2 gameplay that affect every hero. We’ve heard the community feedback around some gameplay pain points, and developed changes to the core gameplay with these goals in mind: Deliver a more consistent feel to firing and landing your shots on your opponents. Lessen the impacts of burst damage to allow for greater counterplay. Adjust where in-game healing and damage are effective to reduce stagnant team fights. All of these changes have been designed to work in combination to balance each other out, and we’re excited for you to get in the game and experience them all at once.  Making Your Shots Feel Good to Hit One of our main goals with these adjustments is to make firing your weapons and abilities feel more consistent without impacting the time to eliminate a target and without removing the overall feel of gameplay we all know and love. When examining how burst damage values have changed over time, we found that in most cases, they've gone down in raw value, though that may not necessarily mean they became weaker relative to other changes. The 5v5 environment and new heroes of Overwatch 2 certainly factor into the perspective, but it's often overlooked that the player base's average skill level, game knowledge, and pace of gameplay are relatively higher now than when the game first launched. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/79dd449e45ca06f896653cac76e2ba61f871a2c7.png When it comes to aiming as a mechanical skill requirement, even players with excellent aim often mention how it can feel random whether a shot hits or not. Due largely in part to the whip speed movement acceleration heroes have when changing directions, combined with all of the dashing/leaping/teleporting abilities, hitting your target can be very difficult. Crisp, responsive movement is important to the core gameplay feel, so we wouldn’t want to just slow down player movement. Instead, we’re improving hit consistency by making both damage-dealing hitscan and travel time projectiles larger. Heroes that have weapons or abilities that don't benefit from any projectile size changes will receive additional balance changes. However, we don’t want to make too many hero adjustments before getting a better understanding of the effects from these initial changes, so tune in for more on individual heroes in future updates. Adjusting Health Pools to Balance Gameplay Since we're increasing the average accuracy of nearly all heroes and want to keep time-to-kill similar, we're also increasing everyone's maximum health. We’ve already balanced damage values, damage boosts, critical damage breakpoints, and other factors around 200-250 HP heroes, so the new health ends up requiring at least one more hit from most heroes to eliminate an enemy. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/cce7d792f2bc7542af7bb7239050895666d69a58.png Giving More Self-Reliance in Team Fights We also want to make sure that the flow of the team fight doesn’t take away from individual player decisions that can determine the outcome of a match. Tanks already have a significant role in each team fight as they often are the ones to take space and determine where each fight takes place. Whereas we want to enable more critical decision-making among the Damage and Support roles. The changes to projectile size and health pools effectively reduce the impact of burst damage and tones down the relative strength of healing, meaning it will take longer to heal someone from 1 HP to full health. To ease the friction of an increased time to fully heal allies out of combat and enable Support players to make more informed decisions on who to heal, everyone can now regenerate health passively at a rate of 20 healing per second after 5 seconds of not taking damage, and the Support role passive heal has been adjusted to 2.5 seconds. An increase to health pools and weakening of burst damage means that heroes live longer and team fights will take longer to conclude. To combat some of the potentially extreme situations there, we’re also introducing a new Damage passive empowering them to more easily fulfill their role in securing eliminations, reduce in-combat healing, and potentially add an additional strategic layer to focus firing targets. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/ba3bd20578ce8b8979bb5d3e4082f22b5babb492.png At its core, Overwatch 2 is a competitive game, so it’s important for the core systems and Competitive System to be as intuitive and accessible as possible. In addition to these core system changes, we’re introducing reworks to Pharah and Junkertown, which we’ll go into in a later blog. For now, let us know what you think when Overwatch 2 – Season 9: Champions launches on February 13! ",

        "contents": "Defense Matrix Season 9 Update – Endorsing Positive Players Learn more about our efforts to improve Endorsements for players and deter disruptive behavior leading into Season 9. The Defense Matrix Initiative is continuing to go strong in 2024. Previously, we shared our efforts to deter leavers in Overwatch 2, promote positive communication, and show the impact of your reports.  As we head into Season 9, we have more to share on our ongoing improvements to Endorsements and disruptive behavior. Giving Endorsements More Impact A common theme of feedback we’ve heard is to give Endorsements greater impact. In the last few seasons, we have already made significant steps to deliver on that. In the Season 7 midseason update, we implemented multiple bug fixes that prevented players from dropping their endorsement rating too quickly and stopped penalizing players who chose to group up with their friends. In Season 8, it is now easier for players to build their endorsement rating than ever before, without worrying about their rating decaying too quickly. There’s also a rule that friends can’t endorse each other.  While this was intentional when we first introduced Endorsements, we don’t want to discourage anyone from celebrating their teammates, even if they are already friends on Battle.net. So, starting in Season 9, we’re removing the restriction to endorse players if you are already friends. Update to Discouraging Leavers We’ve previously shared that we adjusted how players who leave too many games in Quick Play are penalized. This has yielded some positive results, with the number of leavers dropping significantly. In previous game update, players are restricted from queuing for games and can be suspended for up to four hours if they leave six of their last 20 games played. Starting in Season 9, we’re extending these leaver queue restrictions to Mystery Heroes, along with Hero Mastery: Gauntlet, when it is released later this year. Again, we acknowledge there may be reasons for players to step away from their unranked games. However, leaving four or more games will activate queue restrictions until you can play your games to completion. Hammer Down on Cheating Our efforts to fight against cheating are ongoing, and we’re pleased to share our continued progress. Cheats like aimbots and wall hacks take away the competitive integrity of our game. Using cheats also goes against our In-Game Code of Conduct and End User License Agreement. Those identified using cheats will be removed from playing Overwatch 2. Since the launch of Overwatch 2, we have identified and banned over 380,000 accounts that were found to be cheating. In addition, we have suspended or banned over 35,000 accounts that have knowingly grouped up with cheaters. Remember, if you encounter a player in your games that you suspect to be cheating, report them in-game. Transparency Around Account Actions Overwatch 2 is a highly competitive PvP Hero Shooter, and players enjoy different heroes and play styles. This creates exciting matches among friends and players worldwide, but unfortunately, some players may become disruptive and harm that experience for others. When a player is reported across multiple matches, we will take action to suspend or silence those players and will notify them by email when we do, If necessary, we ban repeat offenders from playing on that account.  It’s important to be making sure we are being fair and transparent when we communicate to a player about taking action on their account. We’ve seen a trend in online communities when players share about getting their accounts suspended or banned. In most cases, many of these cases often prove that a player is disruptive, but there are also some cases where we can do a better job at addressing disruptive behavior.  If you feel you’ve been actioned unfairly because someone else may have compromised your account, you may choose to appeal the action, and we’ll review and make a final decision. Keep in mind that you are responsible for your account and should not share it with others for any reason. Remember, saying anything that harasses or ridicules your teammates is inappropriate, regardless of any language used. When you play Overwatch, you are playing with up to nine other players who are just as passionate to play as you are, so it’s up to each of us to make each game the best it can be. Thanks for making Overwatch 2 a fun and positive experience for everyone. We’ll see you when Season 9 launches on February 13.",

It's fast, dynamic, and at its best when two closely matched teams are battling it out for victory. Our goal as a development team is to ensure that all of our players have the opportunity to experience the thrill of competition - From the highs and lows of organized group play to the excitement of watching the world's best players competing at live events. Esports competitions are vital to any thriving competitive game, and Overwatch 2 is no different. Today, we’re excited to talk about what is next for Overwatch Esports. Our philosophy moving into our next chapter of Overwatch Esports is simple: offer and cultivate an esports ecosystem that is more open - with anyone able to participate - always-on, regionally focused, providing experiences for participants and fans alike. Overwatch 2 is a game for everyone, and we want to ensure that anyone who has the skills is able to showcase them. With that said, we are excited to introduce our new Overwatch Esports programs. Introducing the Overwatch Champions Series {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/e1315875b2f7f2c7e73a0f611ab9a8b6e49bb024.png Our esports efforts in 2024 will be multifaceted and the first program that we’re excited to introduce to you all is the Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS). The OWCS is our new premiere international competitive circuit open to players across North America (NA), Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMEA), and Asia. The 2024 season will feature multiple competitive stages where each region will have its own set of Open Qualifiers, giving players the ability to form their own teams and battle it out for their place in the Main Event. The stages will culminate in two live, in-person international events, bringing the regions together for the pinnacle of Overwatch play on the largest stage ever for Overwatch Esports.. Let's dive into how each region will function across the OWCS. North America & EMEA: A Deeper Look {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/7b45881c32006669af8676a2993995d8d1cd967f.png In North America and EMEA, teams will participate in four competitive stages throughout the year alongside our two international OWCS events. Each stage will feature an online Open Qualifier and Main Event where players can earn circuit points, which are used to determine international event qualification. Players can earn circuit points through top finishes in each of these stages–the more points a team earns, the higher their standing on the leaderboards and seeds going into each event. OWCS Stages in North America and EMEA will feature three unique tournament phases - Swiss, Groups, and the Main Event. The Open Qualifier will contain the Swiss phase alongside Groups, which qualifies teams to the Main Event. The Swiss phase will host (a maximum of) 512 teams, to qualify 16 teams into Groups. These 16 teams will compete in groups of 4, with the top 2 teams from each group advancing to the Main Event at our 8-team double elimination regional tournament, all run through our new partners at FACEIT. Stay tuned for further details on the North America and EMEA region schedules at a later date. FACEIT: An Open and Sustainable Overwatch Esports Infrastructure {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/d69afb378140caf7a2e85bb0a090c1c3a1cd27c4.png We are excited to announce this partnership with FACEIT, whose involvement in both North America and EMEA OWCS will boost our ability to bring great experiences to the esports community. Their platform provides an open infrastructure that enables all players to find a network to connect with competitions, teams, brackets, and standings – simplifying the entire experience. A streamlined Overwatch 2 FACEIT experience will be the official way to play in the Overwatch Champions Series in North America and EMEA, starting March 1, 2024. Asia: A Deeper Look {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/0852a94c7803aee64157ea7f8628eebbbea0031e.png A key benefit of having a new international program with distinct regions is the ability to better provide players with experiences that best serve their unique regional needs . As such, the Asia region will look a little different than North America and EMEA. Asia will host three regional subdivisions: Korea, Japan, and Pacific. Each subdivision will host multiple tournaments, with formats tailored to each local audience, all with the direct purpose of qualifying teams up to the OWCS. In Asia, teams will participate in two competitive stages throughout the year, with each stage culminating in a respective international OWCS event.

        "contents": "This weekend only, Sombra is changing up the rules for Quick Play. Enjoy Quick Play: Hacked – Quicker Play - a fun, new way to play with faster capture speeds, payloads, and respawn times. Experience more team fights, more games, and new strategies. Here are the changes: Respawning times are now 75% of their original time. Payloads in Escort and Hybrid maps will move 60% faster. Taking control of the Objective Point in Hybrid is 40% faster than normal. Taking control of the objective point in Control is 40% faster than normal, and scoring the capture progress percentage is 80% faster. Taking control of the objective point in Flashpoint is 20% faster than normal, and scoring the capture progress percentage is 40% faster. When you play an Escort, Hybrid, or Push map, the initial match time has been reduced to 70% of the original time, and any time extensions are also reduced to 70% of the total time added. These changes only apply to all players who play in Role Queue and Open Queue Quick Play modes during the duration of the event and will return to normal after January 14. Competitive Play and Arcade modes are not affected by these changes. Quicker Play is the first Quick Play: Hacked. We want to explore new and fun ways to change core Quick Play gameplay. Changes will happen periodically and only for a limited time. We know you may have some questions, so here is a short FAQ to help: Q. Why change the rules of Quick Play for a weekend? We want to learn what changes to Overwatch 2 you enjoy the most. Testing new ideas with you for a limited time allows us to quickly understand what you like and possibly implement changes to improve gameplay. This also gives players of all skill levels an opportunity to try out new playstyles and strategies that wouldn’t necessarily work as well in a traditional game of Overwatch. Q. Why not create a separate play card in the Arcade? The Arcade is meant for game modes that typically only play one specific map type (like Assault) or completely different ways to play Overwatch. The Quick Play: Hacked changes affect the core gameplay of our main mode, while still aiming to bring a more balanced play experience that is unique from the traditional ruleset. Q. Why didn’t we bring back the Experimental Play card? We want to encourage more players to join in on the fun. In addition, most of the experimental cards from Overwatch tested hero balance changes, whereas these changes affect the core gameplay rules of Quick Play. Q. How can I play the regular Quick Play ruleset? You can start up a custom game with the traditional Quick Play rules and invite other players. Quick Play matchmaking will return to the normal rules after January 14. Be sure to log in starting tomorrow, January 12, through January 14, and see how fast you can keep up with Quicker Play. Let us know what you think and what new hacks to Quick Play you would like to see in the future. ",

        "contents": "Mauga is charging his way onto the Battlefield in a trial weekend, available now through Sunday, November 5. Mauga is a powerful, brawling Tank Hero who will tear through the competition with his incendiary and volatile chainguns. Keep reading to find out how you can jump into Overwatch® 2 right now and play Mauga this weekend before his full release in Season 8. Check Out Mauga’s Burning New Abilities Mauga features a kit that is designed to bash through the front lines and brawl his opponents in close-quarter combat, by wielding two powerful Chainguns that can either be fired individually or in unison. Ignite enemies with his Incendiary Chaingun “Gunny” to burn them when they take enough damage, then finish them with a critical hit from his Volatile Chaingun “Cha-Cha.” Paired with his Berserker Passive, which grants Mauga temporary health whenever he deals critical damage, he’s a mountain on the battlefield. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/aa33748cf83199926630b0e40d6706321c8b4640.png Mauga’s not just a leading star—he also brings a host of new abilities to support his team as well. Mauga can break his way through the front lines with Overrun, a charging ability that cannot be stopped by any crowd control abilities, and stomps into opponents dealing a powerful knockback. When the fight gets intense for his team, he has Cardiac Overdrive to engage both of his hearts and create an aura that reduces incoming damage, allowing allies to heal themselves while dealing damage. Finally, when he really wants to tango up close with his foes, Mauga can unleash Cage Fight, his ultimate ability. Cage Fight traps nearby opponents in a cylindrical fighting ring. This barrier blocks enemy incoming damage or healing from the outside, forcing those trapped inside to face Mauga with Gunny, Cha Cha, and the barrage of infinite ammunition. If you can’t take him down quickly, the last thing you might see is his charming smile. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/461e7d586de260fd9fafc70c205d2f8f70becdc8.png Play Mauga All Weekend Long This weekend, Mauga will be available in a limited-time trial, available for all platforms. This will be part of the live game and will not require a separate installation or download. Mauga will be available to pick as a Tank hero in all modes except for Competitive Play. No Limits will also be available in the Arcade as a great way for everyone to try out Mauga. Once the weekend ends, Mauga will return for his official release in Season 8 on Tuesday, December 5. You’ll then be able to unlock Mauga immediately when you purchase the Season 8 Premium Battle Pass or unlock Mauga when you reach Tier 45 in the standard Battle Pass. Hurry, because this party animal won’t be around for long. Login and try Mauga now through November 5.",

Halloween Terror is back with your favorite game modes—Junkenstein's Revenge, Wrath of the Bride, and Trials of Sanctuary, a new Blizzard crossover game mode. Team up with the heroes of Sanctuary, power up their abilities, and defeat powerful bosses, including Butcher Roadhog, Azmodan Wrecking Ball, and Lilith Moira. NEW MAP - SAMOA Samoa is a new Control map where you’ll fight on a tropical beach, a gleaming city, and inside a volcano! Watch out for deadly pitfalls, or you might just be swimming in lava! Samoa will be available to play right away in a dedicated Arcade card and will appear in Quick Play and other unranked modes starting on October 10 with it appearing in Competitive Play later in the season. HERO REWORK – SOMBRA We approached the Sombra Rework by identifying key goals to guide decisions throughout the design iteration process: make Sombra more committal when engaging, increase the active feel in her ability kit, and uphold the current Hacker fantasy. With these goals, there were multiple angles to tackle around her existing kit. Naturally, many ideas were also meant to address frustrations playing against the character, ensuring there is proper counterplay for enemies. Sombra Machine Pistol Damage increased from 7.5 to 8. Minimum Spread reduced from 0.5 to 0. Number of shots until max spread has been increased from 3 to 6 shots. Reload time reduced from 1.4 seconds to 1.2 seconds. Hack Cast time reduced from 0.75 seconds to 0.65 seconds. Now cancels Stealth when hacking an enemy hero. Cooldown increased from 4 to 6 seconds. Hack has a reduced cooldown of 3 seconds if Hack is interrupted or if a non-hero enemy is hacked. The \"Hacked\" warning text will now only appear while you are silenced and not for the remainder duration of the hack debuff. Opportunist Removed. Stealth Ability reworked to be a passive. Sombra automatically becomes invisible after 3.5 seconds while not shooting, using a damaging ability, or receiving damage. Stealth movement speed bonus reduced from 60% to 45%. Fade Out duration into Stealth reduced from 0.375 seconds to 0.25 seconds. Fade In duration from Stealth reduced from 0.5 seconds to 0.375 seconds. Updated the UI messaging to the Sombra player when hacking Health Packs to \"Revealed\" instead of \"Detected\". Now the message \"Detected\" is only used when an enemy player is in the detection radius. Virus This is a new ability assigned to Ability 1 by default. Fire a projectile that damages an enemy over time. Damage is dealt faster on Hacked enemies. Impact Damage: 10 (20 on hacked target). Damage over time: 100 over 4 seconds (100 over 2 seconds on hacked target). Translocator Can no longer can be manually activated. Translocator will now automatically teleport Sombra after 0.25 seconds from being thrown or when impacting the environment. Reduces the Stealth passive cooldown after teleporting. Projectile speed increased from 25 to 72. Cooldown reduced from 6 seconds to 5 seconds. Cooldown now begins after Sombra teleports to the location of the Transponder. Projectile launch initial vertical offset removed. EMP Ultimate charge cost increased by 15%. Health percent damage decreased from 40% to 30%. GENERAL UPDATES GROUP RESPAWN Heroes who die within 5 seconds of each other will respawn together, resulting in some players having either a slightly longer or shorter queue than the standard 10 seconds. Heroes who die more than 5 seconds from another player eliminated will still respawn in 10 seconds on their own. These changes do not apply to Competitive Play mode. Developer Comments: We think that team fights are some of the most enjoyable moments in our game, but we've all been in matches where team cohesion--or lack thereof--makes these moments a rarity. These matches often turn into stomps for the team that can't group up, and preventing stomps is a high priority for us. As such, this season, we're modifying how heroes respawn for Quick Play. Heroes that die within 5 seconds of each other will be respawned in a wave together. This means that respawn times will sometimes change in order for heroes to respawn together. If a hero dies further apart than 5 seconds from another death on their team, they'll still respawn in 10 seconds as they would have in the past. We'll be listening closely to feedback on this new system, and depending on the response and making any changes, we will consider adding these adjustments to Competitive Play in a later season. UNRANKED LEAVER PENALTIES 75% XP penalty removed. The penalty thresholds have not changed, but the mechanics have also never been completely explained. The last 20 games played a player participated in are recorded. Leaving four of these 20 games activates the first penalty threshold. Leaving six of these 20 games activates the second penalty threshold. Queuing for most game modes is now suspended when a player leaves a match inside a penalty threshold. Players that reach the first penalty threshold will be suspended for 10 minutes. Players that reach the second penalty threshold will be suspended for 30 minutes. The queue suspension will reapply each time a player leaves a game when they are above the first penalty threshold but not when they complete their games. Consecutive Match XP bonus has been renamed to Endurance Bonus. Endurance Bonus is XP granted when finishing matches without leaving the previous match. Developer Comments: Previously, if players left too many games, we would apply a 75% penalty to their Battle Pass XP that is gained. We found this had very little impact on those who leave deliberately and severely impacted those who don’t have much time to play but want to earn the rewards in our season Battle Pass. We’re changing this to make it more difficult for players who leave games to be disruptive while not applying too much impact to those who don’t intend on ruining the experience for others. STORY MISSIONS You can now spectate any Story Mission that your friends are playing if you own the campaign pack for that mission. HERO MASTERY Scoring Update Bonus score granted from time remaining in the gold bonus tier is now accurate to one-hundredth of a second. (Previously completed games in the Top 500 leaderboards are not adjusted.) The user interface has been updated to display this new time accuracy everywhere that we display time and score. Replays Hero Mastery now supports replays. Replays are saved for any completed course that results in a new scoring record. The user interface for Hero Mastery replays has been customized to display score, time, and other information. PLAYER PROGRESSION Lowered show priority for Time Played and Wins sub-badges in the Showcase. Added Virus Kills to Sombra's sub-badge set. Developer comments: All heroes share the Time Played and Wins sub-badges. This change is intended to highlight each hero’s unique sub-badges to better reflect individual playstyle. CHALLENGES Reduced the number of wins required to unlock Sojourn, Junker Queen and Kiriko through Hero challenges. Illari is now unlockable through Hero challenges. HERO UPDATES TANK Orisa Fortify Damage reduction decreased from 50% to 45%. Developer Comments: We are further readjusting Orisa's survivability, which was originally increased due to the armor-damage reduction stacking change we made several patches ago. This particular change is relatively light as we still want her to be an effective pick against teams that lean on crowd control. Ramattra Nemesis Form Cooldown decreased from 8 to 7 seconds. Developer Comments: This change lets Ramattra project his influence more frequently with Nemesis Form, which translates into increased survivability and damage. The flexibility also makes it less punishing if he swaps back to Omnic Form early to use the Void Barrier. Wrecking Ball Quad Cannons Number of shots to reach max spread increased from 20 to 30. Developer Comments: This change lets Wrecking Ball finish off enemies a bit more reliably when he’s outside of point-blank range and makes him less reliant on his Piledriver combos. Zarya Projected Barrier Size decreased 15% now matching back to the size of Particle Barrier. Health decreased from 225 to 200 matching back to the health of Particle Barrier. Developer Comments: Zarya is using the barrier on her allies more often to peel or initiate combination plays, which makes the ability more team-oriented and less self-serving. This change preserves that interesting choice by keeping the cooldown reduced when used on an ally while targeting her energy sustain instead, which has increased significantly with the bonuses to the barrier health and size. DAMAGE Cassidy Combat Roll Damage reduction increased from 50% to 75%. Developer Comments: Most damage mitigation from Combat Roll feels incidental, as the ability is used more for mobility or reloading. This adjustment allows Cassidy to be more intentional with his rolls to avoid large amounts of damage with correct timing. Mei Deep Chill Removed. Endothermic Blaster Damage per second increased from 70 to 100. Now immediately slows enemies by 40% instead of building up over time. Developer Comment: We liked the one-two combo that Deep Chill provided, as it added an interesting layer for hero mastery. However, in practice, it increased the amount of crowd control suffered by enemy players while also reducing Mei's effectiveness. Rather than further increasing the slow or increasing cumulative combo damage, both of which would lead to a more frustrating experience for the opposing player, we are reverting Mei back to her balance prior to adding the Deep Chill passive. Torbjörn Rivet Gun Primary fire recovery increased from .48 to .51 seconds. Overload Overhealth bonus decreased from 100 to 75. Developer Comments: Torbjorn's Rivet Gun can feel overwhelming with how quickly it shoots. This change reduces the firing cadence and makes it more manageable on the receiving end. Overload provides too much defensive value, so we are lowering the overhealth bonus. SUPPORT Brigitte Whip Shot Damage increased from 70 to 80. Developer Comment: This change increases her proficiency at protecting her allies by rewarding accuracy with her most aim-focused ability. Illari Solar Rifle Secondary fire healing per second decreased from 120 to 105. Developer Comments: Illari's burst healing output is still a little too high, so we are lowering the effectiveness of the Solar Rifle secondary fire to bring her more in line with other support heroes. MAP UPDATES ROUTE 66 DESIGN CHANGES There are now additional places for the attacking team to take cover around their initial spawn. The doors on the first checkpoint will now only close one of the two doors after the payload passes by giving attackers more options to work through the difficult choke points. There will also be fewer places to take cover in the later parts of the map.

        "contents": "Defense Matrix – Deterring Leavers in Overwatch 2 In our latest Defense Matrix update, we take a look at a major step to deter disruptive leavers in Overwatch 2 Welcome to another edition of the Defense Matrix, where we update you on our efforts to deter cheating and disruptive behavior in Overwatch 2. Last time, we talked about filtering out and actioning those who use inappropriate text and voice chat, keeping custom games friendly for all players, combating cheat software, and stopping those who take advantage of cheating. As we roll into Season 7, we’ll be focusing on the disruptive behavior of leaving games, along with encouraging the use of effective communication systems like the Ping feature. So, mech up, and let’s get right into it. Understanding the Impact of Leavers In every Overwatch PvP game mode, we hope you enjoy the experience without worrying about others playing with you. However, when a teammate leaves during the match, the fun for everyone involved is impacted. Outside of Competitive Play, we strive to reasonably accommodate anyone who needs to exit a match for reasons outside their control. We certainly don’t want you to stay if you are uncomfortable with a disruptive teammate or opponent (please be sure to report that disruptive player). Or perhaps you may have to attend to things away from the computer at a moment’s notice (hi, new parents). Maybe you encounter technical issues, in which case we encourage you to stick to casual game modes while troubleshooting to avoid disruptive actions if you disconnect. You may often need to pull away from your current game because a group request from your friends just came in. Leaving on such occasions is generally okay because you will not likely disrupt the next match you queue for. The problem comes when someone actively chooses to leave just to be disruptive and immediately queues for another game. When your team is down a teammate, it can feel like every team fight is lost before it starts. We backfill the missing player quickly in most causal game modes like Quick Play. However, the newly added teammate has to start fresh with no Ultimate charge, which can lead to an unsatisfactory experience. This is why we want to discourage players from repeatedly leaving games, especially with the intention to disrupt the experience of others. Introducing Queue Restrictions for Leaving Games Previously, if a player left too many games (more than five of your last twenty played), we would apply a 75% penalty to their Battle Pass XP gained for that match. Still, we found this wasn’t enough to deter deliberate leavers, and other players who had to leave unintentionally were still being impacted negatively. Starting in Season 7, we’re introducing a queue suspension for most game matchmaking queues. If you leave four of your last 20 games played, you will be placed on a 10-minute suspension from queuing for any game mode that grants progression progress. If you continue to leave games, your suspension could increase to 30 minutes between queues. We feel this is a balanced approach because it doesn’t directly affect those who are pulled away from the game—allowing them time before queueing again—while also making it tougher for those who deliberately leave to ruin the experience for others. The penalties for Competitive Play remain the same, starting with a 15-minute suspension if you leave and do not complete a game. This penalty increases with every leaver violation and can result in a suspension from Competitive Play for the rest of the season if you leave too many games. Focusing on Positive Communication In our last Defense Matrix update, we discussed ways to promote positive communication and discourage disruptive behavior with changes to our Text Filter settings. Later in Season 7, we’re taking another small step toward improvement with our ping system. Notably, our ping system and communication wheel provide instant shot calls that any player can easily see and hear regardless of their language. Because the need for text and voice chat is not as critical for most players outside of high-competitive ranks, we will be changing the defaults for both text and voice chat. Text chat will now be set to off by default (previously set to on) for new players in both Team and Match channels. Voice chat will now be set to on (previously set to auto-join) for new players. Those who prefer to communicate through these channels will need to decide to turn them on. We hope this will lead to more effective communication through the ping system while reducing the chance of encountering disruptive communication in the game. Thank You for Reporting! We want to take a moment to thank you for continuing to report. We are seeing more and more of you showing the report notifications you receive when logging into the game! Remember, reporting helps us stop disruptive players and identify new and changing behaviors in our online community. As you continue to report, we want to debunk a few misconceptions, and explain why reporting matters and work to take action on those disrupting the experience for other players. The effectiveness of a report is based on each match in which the disruptive player is reported. This means the report's impact is the same whether just one or up to nine other players make a report. Players are not likely to be actioned if a group of friends collectively report them unless the reported player is being disruptive across multiple matches and getting reported by different players. Asking other players in chat channels to report a specific player doesn’t help and can make a match experience worse for everyone. Another misconception is when to use the Avoid as Teammate option in the social menu. Avoid as Teammate is a versatile tool to help you control and shape your experience. When someone uses the Avoid as Teammate option, that does not affect the player who is avoided in terms of actioning for disruptive play.  The Block function is a Battle.net-wide feature that helps you prevent communication from another player who may be harassing you but doesn’t stop you from being put into another match with that player. Remember to use the Avoid as Teammate tool if you feel uncomfortable around another player. Whenever you see someone being disruptive, please report them! It really helps us out by allowing us to take action more quickly against players that could be ruining the experience for others. Be sure to review our In-Game Code of Conduct as a handy guide to whether you should report a player or not. Thank you for your help to keep our community a positive one! ",

        "contents": "Hola amigos! Andre Abrahamian from the Hero Design Team here subbing in for Aaron this week. I wanted to share with you an in-depth journey through the most recent changes to Sombra, our notorious stealthy hacker. Since her original release in 2016, Sombra has received many changes, including a rework for Overwatch 2's launch. Now the team brings changes to this latest iteration on Sombra once again. When we look at each Overwatch hero, we are guided by general values to provide a great hero experience. Each hero should have clear strengths and weaknesses that can be tuned accordingly. A hero's impact on a match should be felt by you, your team, and the enemy team. That impact should be clear enough to inform counterplay so that enemies infer how to respond to a particular hero or their abilities. With these points in mind, we felt that Sombra did not have the correct building blocks for her long-term place in the game, and that is what started our latest approach to the rework. Establishing the Goals We approached the Sombra Rework by identifying key goals to guide decisions throughout the design iteration process: Make Sombra commit to the fight more when engaging. Increase the active feel in her ability kit. Uphold the current Hacker identity and playstyle. With these goals, there were multiple angles to tackle around her existing kit. Naturally, many ideas were also meant to address frustrations playing against the character, ensuring there is proper counterplay for the opposing team. Translocator is a very versatile tool for map traversal and safe escapes. The teleport is often discussed as a “get out of jail free” ability because Sombra can escape as she chooses before enemies can deal a fatal blow. Due to the nature of Overwatch’s fast-paced gameplay, it’s not common to hunt for Sombra’s translocator as a form of counterplay. It's especially difficult to catch Sombra in Overwatch 2 due to the game-wide reduction to stun frequency. There were also common gameplay styles that leave the translocator in safe regions, such as near a health pack, and perform a rinse-and-repeat strategy of solo engaging enemies. While playing a lone wolf can sometimes be viable, we also want to still have moments of active cooperation with nearby allies. When starting our iteration, we tackled each of these aspects for Translocator, wanting to make it more involved in combat. Stealth is a powerful and unique tool in Sombra’s arsenal, granting invisibility. Naturally, invisibility can be difficult to balance in a competitive multiplayer game. We often discussed certain strengths around the stealth mechanic, such as the capability to Hack while using Stealth, to activate Stealth at any time the cooldown is available, and the infinite duration. We wanted to address each of these concerns during our iterations to see what we can learn from changing them. Hack is one of the strongest parts of Sombra and has received many changes throughout Overwatch’s history. We discussed this mechanic at great length since this was an opportunity to try new ideas and learn from them. Many different versions of hack were tried throughout the rework, and the most common discussion was about how hack could be used while invisible. We moved ahead with wanting to explore new hack debuff possibilities. Based on these highlighted aspects of each mentioned ability, we tackled various combinations of changes to find a formula that felt right for Sombra players and all other players. We didn't just want to nerf Sombra though. We wanted to make sure Sombra had more counterplay and could be even more engaging to use. This led to multiple iteration cycles of playtesting and reacting to internal feedback to find the best version of the Sombra rework that we are happy with. Iteration and Feedback The early iterations for Sombra started off with rather drastic changes on each ability in order to gain new design insights. An early idea for changing Hack involved making it no longer silence abilities but instead would deal damage to the enemy if they used any ability. This proved to not be clear enough for enemies to know how they are taking damage, and it did not have consistent output between each usage since it is relying on the enemy player to react. Another iteration was to make enemies deal less damage for a duration. This change struggled because if the damage reduction value was low then it would go unnoticed, and if the value was high then it quickly became oppressive. Other Hack changes were tried but did not stick because of lacking clarity and impact to enemies. We eventually kept the same hack debuff but made hacking an enemy cancel stealth. This worked well because it made Sombra more committed to engaging the enemy and gave the opposing team a consistent opportunity to respond to her.  Translocator had several iterations alongside Stealth, since they are both Sombra’s mobility and escape tools. An early idea was giving translocator a short duration so that it had to be used during combat. We quickly noticed that Sombra players still preferred to try and use their Translocator in safe spots before engaging. We also learned that this change was pushing Sombra’s gameplay style to be closer to team engagements, which we kept in mind with other changes. Stealth had early changes of becoming a dash ability, giving a jolt of movement and a very short duration of unbreakable stealth. While interesting, to have Sombra quickly glimpse in and out of stealth during fights, enemy players were unhappy with no counterplay for unbreakable stealth, and Sombra players wanted more time to flank behind enemy lines. Eventually, we consolidated the changes to making Translocator a fast teleport and Stealth a passive ability, giving Sombra quicker maneuvers within combat allowing enemies to have more opportunities to react to her. We talked about the Opportunist passive and decided to remove it, making room for the new Stealth passive, while also removing the passive elements of automatically revealing enemies and gaining bonus impact gun damage. We wanted to turn these passive Opportunist elements into something more actively noticable. With this closely combative version of teleporting and stealth, we then started balancing this survivability with some more lethality, which led us to exploring the many possibilities of a new damage ability. Exploring New Abilities With the mobility and survivability in a place we felt happy with, we began iterating on new forms of damage. A long list of ideas was explored, ranging anywhere from cybernetic devices to digital malware. An early idea at the top of the list was a laser wire trap. An idea from her original design, Sombra would place a trap on a wall, and it automatically trigger on nearby enemies to deal damage and slow. Playtests showed that it took too much time preparing the trap, and had little to possibly no effect during combat, so we went back to the drawing board. Another ability was called “Cybernetic Wire” and would deal damage in an arc, dealing bonus damage to enemies at low health. The intent was to secure kills as a “finishing blow” style ability. This felt too oppressive because of the high amount instant damage that can be dealt to multiple enemies at once, and it was sometimes difficult for Sombra to perceive the physical range in first-person while simultaneously using the machine pistol. Though there were problems, there was excitement around this new form of damage, and we then pivoted to skill shot ability ideas. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/dafb362098cffed7a5b51be34486e7b169586ad7.png Eventually, the ability known today as “Virus” was born as a projectile that deals damage over time. It synergized well with the ranged playstyle, and enemies had more time to respond to the damage over time. We learned that this new form of damage can make Sombra players less likely to hack enemies when engaging out of stealth, so we explored a bonus interaction when Virus impacts hacked targets. Some bonus Virus impact ideas were reducing its cooldown when hitting hacked enemies or spreading the damage to nearby targets. Neither of these felt very clear to enemy players. We settled with the idea of making Virus deal faster damage over time for hacked targets since that had a better balance for enemies to notice and react to the effects. Once we were happy where this rework was heading, multiple playtests were hosted across the team to collect more feedback and fine-tune the numeric balance. Further playtests helped us tweak changes in the rework, such as making Translocator also reduce the passive Stealth cooldown, giving some extra survivability back to Sombra. Overall, we finished the rework with the changes you see starting in Season 7: a quick teleport version of Translocator for a more combinative and trackable Sombra, a passive stealth that gives enemies time to react to Sombra before she escapes, and the new Virus ability that gives Sombra more lethality. Sombra Machine Pistol Damage increased from 7.5 to 8. Minimum Spread reduced from 0.5 to 0. Number of shots until max spread has been increased from 3 to 6 shots. Reload time reduced from 1.4 seconds to 1.2 seconds. Hack Cast time reduced from 0.75 seconds to 0.65 seconds. Now cancels Stealth when hacking an enemy hero. Cooldown increased from 4 to 6 seconds. Hack has a reduced cooldown of 3 seconds if Hack is interrupted or if a non-hero enemy is hacked. The \"Hacked\" warning text will now only appear while you are silenced and not for the remainder duration of the hack debuff. Opportunist Removed. Stealth Ability reworked to be a passive. Sombra automatically becomes invisible after 3.5 seconds while not shooting, using a damaging ability, or receiving damage. Stealth movement speed bonus reduced from 60% to 45%. Fade Out duration into Stealth reduced from 0.375 seconds to 0.25 seconds. Fade In duration from Stealth reduced from 0.5 seconds to 0.375 seconds. Updated the UI messaging to the Sombra player when hacking Health Packs to \"Revealed\" instead of \"Detected\". Now the message \"Detected\" is only used when an enemy player is in the detection radius. Virus This is a new ability assigned to Ability 1 by default. Fire a projectile that damages an enemy over time. Damage is dealt faster on Hacked enemies. Impact Damage: 10 (20 on hacked target). Damage over time: 100 over 4 seconds (100 over 2 seconds on hacked target). Translocator Can no longer can be manually activated. Translocator will now automatically teleport Sombra after 0.25 seconds from being thrown or when impacting the environment. Reduces the Stealth passive cooldown after teleporting. Projectile speed increased from 25 to 72. Cooldown reduced from 6 seconds to 5 seconds. Cooldown now begins after Sombra teleports to the location of the Transponder. Projectile launch initial vertical offset removed. EMP Ultimate charge cost increased by 15%. Health percent damage decreased from 40% to 30%  Moving Forward We hope this offers more insight into our development process behind hero reworks and our intentions for Sombra’s ability changes. These iterations are focused on making Sombra a more fun and exciting hero to play, and a less frustrating hero to fight against. We feel that this new version of Sombra will provide new combative playstyles and clearer experience for all players. We will continue to watch how Sombra performs going forward and will adjust balance when the time is right. As with all heroes in Overwatch, Sombra is very important to us, and we value the feedback of our amazing community. Thank you for reading! Boop! ",

Overwatch 2 – Season 7: The Rise of Darkness comes with dozens of new balance changes, but notably, we’re introducing a whole new ability kit for Sombra. We’ve removed Opportunist and adjusted her Stealth ability to be a passive that starts automatically when Sombra is not taking damage or dealing damage or abilities. Her Translocator is also reworked to instantly teleport her wherever it is thrown. Finally, she has a new ability—Virus—which is a skill shot that deals damage over time to the target it hits and does double damage and at a faster rate if they are already hacked. Along with tuning to her Machine Pistol, Hack, and EMP, you’ll find that she will be more engaging to play with and play against. Our goal is to allow Sombra to be more committed to the targets she engages with and have a more active feel to her kit, all the while maintaining her character identity and playstyle as the world’s greatest hacker. We’ll have more details about Sombra’s rework in an upcoming blog. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/dafb362098cffed7a5b51be34486e7b169586ad7.png Hero Balance Preview for Season 7 We’re also bringing in balance changes for an assortment of other heroes. Notable changes affect Mei, where we are rolling back the changes we first introduced in Season 5, bringing her back to her previous kit and no longer having the Deep Chill passive. We’re also partly reverting the changes to Zarya’s Projectile Barrier we introduced last season so that she can’t build up energy more quickly, but still has a faster cooldown to protect her allies. Plus, tuning for Orisa, Ramattra, Wrecking Ball, Cassidy, Torbjorn, Brigitte, and Illari. Learn about these balance changes for Season 7 in our latest Director’s Take blog. Take a Trip on the All-New Route 66! Route 66, one of the original Escort Maps for Overwatch, is getting some adjustments that should give better protection for attackers to exit their initial spawn. Despite the overhanging rail cars blocking the view, the Panorama Diner is pleased to announce that they are open for business and offers additional cover from either the hot sun or the barrage of weapon fire from the Defending team. As you push the Payload past the first checkpoint, the doors will now malfunction and only close part way giving attackers more options to work through the difficult choke points. Defenders will have more options to stop attacking teams from capping the final checkpoint as some of the cargo is now removed in the Deadlock Gang’s lair. You’ll also be able to cool off with new overcast lighting for the map. We look forward to seeing you all cruise the payload down the new Route 66. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/984ed27f24acd9ee7d541f39708656bf47d45866.png More to Come! Everything we’ve talked about so far will be available to jump into for all platforms when Season 7 launches on Tuesday, October 10! Also, as an apology due to a bug with our Anniversary Event challenges, everyone who logs in from October 10 to October 16 will receive 3,000 Overwatch Credits to spend in our Event Shop or on other cosmetics in the Hero Gallery.  We’ve got even more great content and updates in the weeks to come, including some new surprises you’ll learn about in BlizzCon 2023.

        "contents": "Director’s Take – Retrospective on Season 6 Hero Balance Hero Designer Alec Dawson reflects on the past season for hero balance and previews upcoming changes for Overwatch 2 Hey y'all! This is Alec, Lead Hero Designer, stepping in for Aaron this week. We thought this Director’s Take would be a good time to chat about our heroes, recent balance changes, and what we’ve learned from them, and talk a bit about the philosophy behind our two upcoming reworks for Sombra and Roadhog. Illari and the Safe Side of Strong Let’s start with Illari. Going into Illari’s launch, our slogan was “safe side of strong.” We want hero releases to be impactful. It’s best for the game for a number of reasons, but most importantly, it creates change throughout the meta. An impactful hero launch can shift other heroes’ viability and create new and unique team compositions - an unimpactful hero launch can feel as if the game didn’t enter a new season. Making a new hero feel impactful on launch is challenging because we are asking you to choose between that hero and their overall potential versus picking the heroes that you may have hundreds or thousands of hours on. Players like to try new things, but players also like to win. To mitigate this friction, while you are learning the nuances of a hero, we generally will continue to aim for the “safe side of strong” with our hero releases and then tune them where necessary. In situations where the hero's kit contains mechanics we'd describe as more “sharp” or potentially polarizing (say we were to release Widowmaker again), we may exercise more caution with this approach. We aimed to make sure Illari was powerful, and we were happy to see that she launched in an impactful, game-changing state, but it's important to evaluate where that power is coming from. A lot of her initial power budget was wrapped up in her Healing Pylon and her lethality. Despite its potency, the Healing Pylon itself can feel invisible throughout a match due to its fire-and-forget automated healing. It was one of the first things we tuned for a few reasons. First, it can create situations that resemble stalemates. Next, breaking through the line of defense to shoot the pylon can already be a difficult task - it shouldn't be hard to kill once you're shooting it. Finally, as a more passive ability, it does not have the immediate impact and satisfaction of other elements in her kit, like her primary and secondary fire. Going forward, we'll continue to iterate on Illari's balance whilst making sure she doesn't feel muted. We think there's still a good amount of room there, and we will be making an adjustment to her secondary fire healing in Season 7. Layers of Balance Now let's talk about some recent balance changes and how we approach our start-of-season and mid-season updates. There are a few goals when we approach balancing Overwatch 2, but two that are consistently front of mind are that Hero changes should be an improvement to the game experience - whether that be on the individual hero themselves or to the overall metagame - and to also keep the game feeling fresh across seasons. With these goals in focus, we aim to make impactful changes that meaningfully inject themselves into the gameplay loop of a hero. There may also be number tuning alongside those, but we don't want to be in a world of arbitrarily injecting change by shifting the same numbers up and down from season to season (like Soldier 76's primary fire damage, for example). So, while a balance update may have reactive changes that look to knock down some of the top-performing heroes, it should also have changes that evoke intrigue and have you asking questions like “How does this new ripple on an ability affect my matchups?” When considering non-reactive changes to heroes, we usually begin with a question, or overarching goals. Let's take the recent Zarya changes as an example. Our aim here was to add more incentive to Zarya bubbling allies versus using two bubbles for herself (a fairly common behavior). How do we incentivize that enough? How do we make it noticeable in-game? A common strategy we employ here is to layer multiple changes onto a hero that all help achieve our stated goal. For Zarya, that was the reduced cooldown for using a bubble on an ally + the increased size of the ally bubble + the increased health of the ally bubble. While this strategy comes up against our overall complexity goals, layering allows us to have individual changes that work synergistically together without needing to have any particularly extreme individual changes. This also helps when we want to further fine-tune what we’re trying to achieve, as we can easily remove any number of those smaller, layered changes as needed. If we are willing to pull back quickly enough, layering is an approach we'll continue to utilize in certain instances. For Zarya, we are going to be pulling back on the size of the ally bubble + the health of the ally bubble, but we will be keeping the reduced cooldown. Coming Soon Looking closer at Season 6 and the current metagame, we’ve seen Bastion, Orisa, and Torbjorn rise in popularity. The standout among them has been Bastion: he’s been succeeding at all ranks and is higher than we like at the highest levels of play (around a 55% unmirrored win rate). We’re happy with the added reliability to his primary fire and Tactical Grenade, but we are going to remove his armor repair when transforming into Configuration Assault – that has made Bastion quite difficult to kill, even when out of position (a note here: in the middle of writing this blog, we decided to hotfix this change earlier than Season 7). Some other adjustments that we are reverting or pulling back on at the start of Season 7: Orisa’s Fortify damage reduction, Torbjorn's Primary Fire recovery time, and Mei's changes that we introduced in Season 5. On those reverts to Mei, it’s important to recognize when a swath of changes isn’t resulting in improved gameplay. Our goal of trying to reintroduce some of her previous mini-game to her primary fire was a good one, but it resulted in a hero that was more frustrating to play against - especially from a Tank point of view - and wasn’t clearly more engaging or effective to play. Finally, we’re looking forward to revealing our plans for our upcoming reworks. Sombra’s changes will be coming at the start of Season 7. Here are some of our stated goals heading into her rework: Make Sombra more committal when engaging Increase the active feel throughout her kit Uphold her current hacker identity and playstyle Roadhog is currently undergoing the finishing touches that will release with his rework in Season 7’s Midseason Patch. Our broad goals for his rework are as follows: Increase his ability to protect his team and claim space Maintain his overall identity and playstyle Move some of his power around so that his effectiveness isn’t so tied to his one-shot potential We’ll get into more details for Sombra and Roadhog’s reworks in the weeks ahead, including looks at a new ability for each of them. That’s all for now! Thank you for your continued feedback, and I’ll see you in-game! ",

        "contents": "Defense Matrix – Text Chat Changes, Stopping Cheating, and Improving Reporting In our latest update to our Defense Matrix initiative, we’re sharing new changes to make the Overwatch 2 experience fun and fair. Hello heroes! We’re back with news from the Defense Matrix team, covering our latest efforts to bring a positive and fair gameplay experience to Overwatch 2. We've been taking big steps to help discourage and remove disruptive behavior and cheating and wanted to share more details with you. Hold on, what is Defense Matrix?  We’re glad you asked! Defense Matrix is the name for our collection of efforts to quell the cheating, disruptive chat, and griefing issues that negatively impact many multiplayer video games, including Overwatch 2.  These efforts are the product of a dedicated task force of developers, researchers, and community experts, all working to improve our existing systems while finding new ways to counter disruptive behaviors. Guided by two core principles, we strive to keep Overwatch 2 a positive player experience. The first is Fair is Fun, meaning all players should have the same level playing field when it comes to the game. The second is to foster a Safe and Inclusive Social Experience, working to prevent and discourage disruptive and unwanted behaviors from players. Improving Text Chat Text chat is one of the most basic ways players communicate with each other in-game. Previously, there were three text chat settings: Unfiltered, which did not have any restrictions, Mature, which allowed for more “adult” common language, and Friendly, which removed any words identified as obscene, vulgar, or offensive.  Starting this season, we are removing the Unfiltered text chat option from the social menu, since this allowed harmful language and phrases that have no place in our community. We recommend you use the Friendly setting if you want to avoid seeing inappropriate and disruptive language that we commonly filter. All new players start with this as their default text chat setting. The Mature text chat option permits some vulgar words commonly seen in open communication in any team-based online game that, in many cases, are considered acceptable when not used to insult or harass other players. Players who had their text chat filter set to Unfiltered have been moved to Mature. Regardless of which setting you decide to use, it’s never acceptable for anyone to direct disruptive chat toward other players, no matter what language is used. Our filters are constantly updating, but so is the online culture lexicon. If you see anyone using any offensive language that is not being filtered, or anyone working around our filters using altered or misspelled text, please report them in-game for disruptive communication. For all platforms, you can find the report option in the social menu. If you play on a PC, you can also right-click the username directly in text chat. Expanding Disruptive Voice Chat Detection and Actioning We’ve talked previously about our use of machine-learning algorithms to help identify, transcribe, and verify reports of disruptive voice chat. We’re proud to have this running effectively in most regions, and we’ll continue rolling this out worldwide in all in-game supported languages. We've seen this technology correct negative behavior immediately, with many players improving their disruptive behavior after their first warning. Your reports make a difference! If you encounter disruptive voice chat, please report it as quickly as possible, as this increases the likelihood that the disruptive voice chat is captured, transcribed, confirmed, and appropriately actioned. Cracking Down on Inappropriate Naming Names matter. What we choose to call ourselves in-game is an important part of playing the fantasy we want. But sometimes they can be disruptive too. We’re working on quickly identifying and removing inappropriately named custom games and BattleTags. If you encounter inappropriate custom games, please report them directly via the mode’s information panel. Custom Games deemed inappropriate will be removed and cannot be created the same way again, and actions will be taken on accounts that maliciously post inappropriate Custom Games. Along the same lines of inappropriate naming, utilizing user-generated content features like Custom Games to advertise services violates our in-game Code of Conduct. In effort to get rid of such cases, we’re increasing the requirement for new accounts to be able to name Custom Games up to 25 unranked or arcade games played. Combating Cheating at its Source Cheaters are never fun to play with, and we have a zero-tolerance policy toward cheating and botting in Overwatch 2. Since Overwatch 2’s launch, we’ve detected and banned over 250,000 accounts for cheating. We’re continuously refining our anti-cheat detection and prevention systems to strengthen the game against cheating and botting. Your reports help us identify new cheat programs as well as cheating players, so please keep reporting! No More Benefitting from Cheaters We’ve previously shared that we take action on accounts that conspicuously group with cheaters in an attempt to benefit from the cheating. Already, we’ve suspended and banned thousands of accounts verified as grouping with cheaters. The rollout of this system in regional tests has proven successful, and we’ll be expanding to new regions worldwide. If you see something suspicious, please continue to report the cheaters and not others on the cheater’s team. Once the cheater is correctly identified, we’ll take action on the players grouped with the cheater separately as necessary. The Value of Reporting Okay, but does my reporting really matter? Yes! It’s important to report disruptive behavior as you see it. Along with our continued development of the Defense Matrix, your reports help verify consistently disruptive players, as well as help us to identify emerging trends in disruptive behavior as the culture in online games continues to evolve.  And to make sure you know just how important your report is, we’re working to improve timely feedback on your reports, such as providing more consistent log-in notifications when your reports result in successful actions against misconduct. When you see that notification, a player you reported has been actioned for their disruptive behavior so that you can see the positive impact of your reporting. Keep up the good work! Thank you, heroes, for your continued efforts to help us keep Overwatch 2 a fun and fair game for everyone to play!",

        "contents": "Director’s Take – Looking to the Future of Competitive Overwatch Game Director Aaron Keller’s latest blog looks at the future of Competitive Play in Overwatch 2 Hello, everyone! We've seen a lot of conversations around Competitive in Overwatch lately, and I'd like to take most of this week's Director's Take to address it. But first, let’s have a quick hero update. We made several changes to Illari when she was enabled for Ranked. Most notably, the healing for her pylon was reduced, and her Ultimate projectile size was decreased while it no longer pierces barriers. The Pylon nerfs effectively equalized the healing between her pylon and Solar Rifle. Pre-nerf, the Healing Pylon accounted for about 62% of her healing; now that number is 55%. This change also brings her more in line with other damage-forward supports, whereas before, she was outputting healing numbers close to Lifeweaver and Mercy. We're happy with those latest changes and the additional changes made to Captive Sun. We’ll continue to monitor her damage output and see if anything needs addressing next season. Additionally, we're looking at Roadhog's underperformance and targeting his rework for the midseason update in Season 7. Over the past few weeks, more people have been talking about Competitive Play. Conversations really started to trend following a video from Eskay. I'd like to join in on the conversation. I agree with a lot of what has been said – and I want to share a glimpse into what the development team is thinking and the direction that we're likely to go with Competitive in the future.  The team has been working on changes to our Competitive mode for some time, but moderate to major changes to the mode won't find their way into the game until sometime down the road. I won’t be able to address every issue that people are discussing in this piece, but I would like to address some of the major ones. We’ll share more details on specifics as we get closer to releasing the changes. changes. Some feedback we’ve heard about the current system is that you’re not pleased with how much information about the match, and your progress is hidden from you. We understand you want to know how the system works, especially regarding how your rating goes up, down, or even changes at all) when you get a Competitive Update, along with trying to figure out how fair a match is at the start of a game. For instance, we’ve seen players go 5-2 and be demoted at their next Competitive Update. Many of the reports investigated so far have occurred due to MMR decay. For instance, if you typically pick DPS and go a significant amount of time between playing other roles, then MMR decay could kick in between updates for lesser-played roles. Since decay is tracked per role, this could pull your rating down far enough to cause the demotion. When players see this happen, they would justifiably assume there was an issue with the system. Many of the changes that came with our Competitive 2.0 update were based on values centered around pulling frustrating moments out of the experience but came at the cost of obscuring other information. Going forward, we’re shifting our values to provide more transparency to the mode. This doesn't necessarily mean that the older skill rating measurement is or isn't coming back. As we continue to iterate on the possibilities, we very much appreciate your continued feedback. We want you to have a better understanding of what your true rank is and why wins and losses cause it to move up or down based on the general skill level of all players in a match. Additionally, we understand the way we track progress can cause losses to feel more frustrating. Currently, the system will provide a rank update after every five wins or fifteen losses. After each win, progress is shown on a screen during the end-of-round flow, but losses are not. When the game doesn't acknowledge the loss, it can feel as though the whole match was a waste of time. We’re making changes so that the system will contribute your progress toward a rank update after every match, whether you win or lose, so that no match feels like a complete waste of time. We're also talking about the Top 500 leaderboard and some of the unique issues for that experience. If you are in the Top 500, you are among the most competitive players in the community, and we think there are additional needs and issues than the rest of the community. One example of a unique problem is the difficulty of climbing the Top 500 leaderboard later in the season versus playing early in the season when it's easier to place higher. They also have more issues with queue times, grouping with friends, and finding fair matches when the spectrum of skill in this group can still be fairly substantial. We also believe that the Top 500 experience is a more full-featured experience than how other players interact with Competitive. Competing with and passing other players on the ladder makes the Top 500 leaderboard exciting. It's not something that most players get to experience. Eventually, we'd love to find a way for players of other ranks to have an experience in climbing the ranks that feels more granular than just moving in and out of skill tiers. This is a long-term goal and is something we are just thinking about right now. Overwatch 2 is always evolving and growing. We'd like for it to be doing that in a way that is exciting for players and in a direction that they would like. One of the best ways to accomplish this is to have a healthy dialog between players and developers. Some of these Competitive changes will be made in the short term (like how we treat MMR decay), but other issues will be handled with broader changes coming early next year. Ultimately, we are aiming to make the system more transparent, add more frequent reporting, open up some of our restrictions for grouping at high-skill tiers, and look to introduce new competitive rewards. Let’s keep the conversation going!  Thanks for reading - I'll see you in game. ",

        "contents": "Overwatch 2 Retail Patch Notes – September 5, 2023 OVERWATCH 2 ANNIVERSARY 2023 We’re celebrating the first year of Overwatch 2! Come and play returning event game modes, including Battle for Olympus, Catch-A-Mari, Starwatch, and Mischief and Magic! You’ll also be able to take part in new challenges that reward Overwatch Credits, which can be spent on returning Legendary skins from the in-game shop. Join the celebration when it begins on September 19! NEW GAME MODE – HERO MASTERY Hero Mastery is a new, single-player game mode that allows players to test their skills with individual heroes on custom courses. Push your expertise to the limit for high scores and dominate the leaderboards. Are you up to the challenge? Each hero can be played on three unique courses of increasing difficulty. Flex your skills and unlock up to five stars on each course. Hero Mastery courses are scored on various factors, including time, eliminations, heals, and escorts. Each hero has individual stats that are tracked as well. Plus collect all the Mastery Emblems to show off your prowess! Hero Mastery is launching with a limited-time event that includes exclusive rewards. Courses for Tracer, Reinhardt, and Mercy are now available, along with courses for Sojourn, Winston, and more premiering in the weeks ahead. GENERAL UPDATES PING SYSTEM UPDATES Owned entities (such as Torbjörn's Turret, Symmetra's Teleporter, or Illari's Healing Pylon) now have a lower priority as ping targets than enemy heroes. HERO UPDATES TANK Zarya Projected Barrier Health increased from 200 to 225. Cooldown decreased from 10 to 8 seconds. Size increased 15%. Developer Comment: Zarya often spends both barrier charges on herself as it is usually more consistent for building energy. The change to Projected Barrier incentivizes using the barrier for her allies more often. Junker Queen Jagged Blade Impact damage increased from 50 to 65. Developer Comment: This change rewards throwing accuracy with the Jagged Blade without directly affecting Junker Queen's self-healing. Orisa Fortify Cooldown begins when the ability is activated instead of when it ends. Cooldown increased from 12 to 16.5 seconds. Overhealth bonus decreased from 125 to 100. Developer Comment: The Fortify cooldown has been adjusted so that the effective uptime remains the same. However, Orisa is no longer incentivized to cancel the ability early to begin the cooldown immediately, which makes the interval between uses consistent and more susceptible to counterplay. DAMAGE Ashe The Viper Reload time decreased from .25 to .2 seconds. Developer Comment: Ashe has the longest total reload time of all heroes to balance out the advantage of being able to shoot after a partial reload. However, we are shortening it slightly to make the full reload from empty less punishing. Bastion A-36 Tactical Grenade Impact damage decreased from 30 to 15. Configuration Artillery: Can no longer deal critical hits. Developer Comment: The A-36 Tactical Grenade is now more reliable after having its projectile size increased recently, so it doesn't need to be quite as damaging. The change to Configuration Artillery is a bug fix from what was intended for the ultimate, and we’ll monitor to see how this impacts Bastion’s performance. Mei Endothermic Blaster Damage increased from 65 to 70 per second. Duration before slow falls off between primary fire hits increased from 0.5 to 0.6 seconds. Deep Chill Bonus damage can now also be triggered with Mei's quick melee. Developer Comment: Mei is still underperforming after her last set of changes, so we are increasing the effectiveness of primary fire and improving the quality of life to Deep Chill. SUPPORT Support Passive Duration until support passive activates increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds. Developer Comment: Support heroes have received individual improvements to their survivability and are quite strong overall, so we're reducing the impact of the role-wide passive. Baptiste Regenerative Burst Instant healing decreased from 50 to 40. Heal over time decreased from 50 over 5 seconds to 40 over 4 seconds. Developer Comment: Regenerative Burst’s overall healing output has been too effective after gaining the bonus instant heal for low-health allies, so we are reducing its total healing slightly. Kiriko Protection Suzu Now passes through enemy heroes. Developer Comment: The Protection Suzu no longer knocks back enemy heroes, so the projectile doesn't need to impact them either. This quality-of-life change prevents accidental activations when thrown into groups with both enemies and allies. BUG FIXES GENERAL Fixed an issue with the Daybreak challenge being reset to 0 and not receiving progress after completing games. The Save-a-Mari challenge now specifies the difficulty requirements for completion. Resolved an issue where the Progression Level badge wasn't promoting. Players who have already reached levels where the badge should now be promoted to the correct badge now. Fixed a bug with the Option 'Relative Aim Sensitivity' not accepting a value of 0%. Fixed an instance where equipped Competitive Titles would reset after a relog. Fixed a bug with Matches Played showing as abandoned for matches played on another platform. Fixed gaps and other environment issues in Mischief and Magic. Fixed navigation issues that could occur with a controller in Winston's Lab. Fixed the missing sound effects for Training Bots respawning. Fixed a bug on controller/gamepads that prevented some characters from flying diagonally. Resolved a bug with the Overtime bar not burning all the way down in Competitive, making it difficult to tell when the round is over. Fixed an issue that prevented players from immediately equipping Golden weapons after purchase. MAPS Dorado Fixed a bug in the environment near the final point that sometimes allowed Mei's Blizzard to go through the environment. New Junk City Fixed areas on the map that players could become stuck in. Fixed lighting issues in specific areas on the map. Added the intro when loading into the map. You will now be greeted with 'Welcome to New Junk City.' Suravasa Fixed some fountains on the map that allowed some turrets to be hidden. Fixed a few areas that did not have correct lighting. Fixed areas on the map that players could become stuck on. Fixed areas on the map that allowed players to stand outside the playable space. Fixed gaps in the geometry in several areas across the map. CO-OP MISSIONS Rio Fixed a bug that could occur after the Artillery lands that resulted in your camera looking at the sky after regaining control of the camera. Toronto Fixed an interaction with the train that could force players outside of the map boundaries. Fixed a bug with lighting that could occur on this map when changing graphics settings. Gothenburg Fixed a location in spawn where players could become stuck. HEROES Bastion Fixed an error that resulted in the vertical knockback on Bastion's Tactical Grenade being reduced. Echo Fixed a bug with Duplicated Illari's displaying the incorrect VFX colors when casting Captive Sun. Fixed an interaction with Duplicated Symmetra turrets persisting through the duration of Duplicate. Illari Fixed an interaction with Genji's Deflect and Illari's Healing Pylon. Deflecting the pylon should now correctly heal Genji's allies. Fixed a bug that prevented the Stay Dead voice line from being equipped. Resolved an interaction that allowed Illari to see underneath the map if they were slept by an Ana Sleep Dart while using Captive Sun. Fixed an interaction with Illari's Pylon indicator being disabled if it was Hacked by Sombra. Fixed an interaction with Symmetra's Teleporter that allowed Illari to place a Pylon in mid-air. Fixed several instances that resulted in the Pylon being destroyed instantly after deploying. Junker Queen Fixed a bug where Junker Queen recalling Jagged Blade in the same frame as it stuck in an object (by holding Secondary Fire and aiming at an object the same distance away as the Knife's recall range) would cause a pingable knife to be stuck in the world. Kiriko Fixed a bug that made it difficult to Swift Step to allies in rooms with low ceilings. Lifeweaver Fixed a bug allowing friendly EMPs to destroy your Petal Platform. Ramattra Resolved a bug that prevented the damage increase from Zenyatta's Discord from being correctly applied while Ramattra was Blocking. ",

Do you have the fastest kill rate as you zip past the front lines? Are you an expert at charging your enemies? Do you master the skies with your Guardian Angel skills? Prove and enhance your skills as you take on the new Hero Mastery mode in Overwatch 2! Hero Mastery is an all-new single-player mode, permanently available for everyone. The objective for Hero Mastery is to race through an action-packed course filled with training bots, obstacles, and jump pads as you race for the finish line. It’ll test your skills and limitations across training courses for Mercy, Reinhardt, and Tracer, with Sojourn and Winston coming later this Season.  Your score is based on how fast you reach the finish line, how many enemy bots you defeat, and how many Emblems you collect throughout the course. Watch Out for New Training Bots With new courses come new Training bots! While most of the enemy training bots will look familiar, there will also be new challenging ones to shoot, dodge, and block. Tank Bots are beefy machines with high HP and barriers. Rocket Bots shoot projectiles that will deal significant burst damage. And Sniper Bots take out their targets from long range. These training bots will be strategically placed throughout the map, so you’ll have to figure out how to deal with them as you master each course. In some cases, you’ll need to defeat the enemy bots in a specific section before continuing to the next. In other cases, you’ll help keep friendly bots from being destroyed. Don’t worry—if a bot gets the best of you, simply restart the course! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/5999d204f17b2c42b344aad380381bc9db94f150.png Boosting Your Score Looking for the highest score? There are two ways to achieve an impressive score in Hero Mastery Mode: collecting Emblems and finishing with a fast time. Picking up Emblems grants additional bonus points to your score. Large Emblems are worth an extra bonus on rare occasions but reaching them will be much trickier than the small Emblems.  Each hero’s course also rewards bonuses based on their abilities, so strategize carefully to get maximum impact in the course! Then comes your speed through the course. Depending on how quickly you reach the finish line, you’ll be granted scaling multipliers of gold, silver, or bronze.  Your time, combined with how many Emblems you collect, will determine your star rating and total score earned on the course. Become A Hero Master! Each hero comes with three courses, each with increasing difficulties. Completing the Recruit course with at least a 3-star rating will grant access to the Agent course. Testing your skills in the Expert course requires a 4-star rating or higher in the Agent course. Each hero also comes with an exclusive Player Icon,  an exclusive Name Card, and bonus Battle Pass XP, rewarded after mastering the three courses. Keep track with the Top 500 leaderboards showcasing the highest scores in each region! New Limited-Time Challenges We’re kicking off Hero Mastery mode with a limited-time event! Now through September 25, earn new rewards—including an exclusive Weapon Charm, Souvenir, Spray, and Title—when you complete the limited-time event challenges! Courses are now available for Tracer, Mercy, and Reinhardt, with courses for Sojourn and Winston coming in the weeks ahead. Don’t worry if your favorite hero isn’t available yet—more courses for other heroes will be arriving in future Seasons. Hero Mastery is free for all players in Overwatch 2, so jump in and blink, charge, and fly your way to the finish line today! ",

HERO UPDATES SUPPORT Illari Healing Pylon Heal decreased from 40 to 30. Shields decreased from 75 to 50. Captive Sun Projectile Impact and explosion are now blocked by barriers. Projectile size decreased from 1.5 to 0.75 meters. Sunstruck duration decreased from 7 to 6 seconds. Dev Comments: Illari has had a strong showing since her launch. The following changes are meant to promote a better balance between healing and damage while adding more counterplay against her abilities. We are making the Healing Pylon weaker, as it's often placed out of line-of-sight or at odd angles and isn't being destroyed as often as we expect. Captive Sun ignoring barriers is not immediately intuitive, but we are also reducing the projectile size, so blocking or destroying will require more precision. Finally, the Sunstruck effect lasts too long to reasonably avoid the detonation damage threshold. BUG FIXES GENERAL Fixed bug where some event challenges weren't counting towards \"Savior of the Underworld\" for the Brigitte Sparkplug skin. Fixed an issue that made the Ashe Snakewrangler Skin in the Battle Pass a premium reward instead of a free one. Any player on the free Battle Pass track who already unlocked this tier will receive this skin automatically. Fixed an issue that resulted in players backfilling into the Underworld Event Mission and Invasion Story Missions. Fixed an issue that allowed Spectating of players in the Underworld Event Mission and Invasion Story Missions. HEROES Echo Fixed an issue with cloned Illari's Captive Sun explosion, damaging herself and her allies. Orisa Fixed an issue where the \"Who Said Chivalry Is Dead?\" voice line is missing from Hero Gallery. Fixed an issue where Orisa World Cup Skin was inaccessible. MISSIONS Toronto Fixed in a previous update - Fixed an issue with Slicers clipping into the Ferry, making them difficult to target. Gothenburg Fixed in a previous update - Fixed an issue where \"The Babies Are Safe\" challenge was unable to be completed. Fixed an issue with the Titan being invisible for the first few seconds of its intro. Fixed an issue with an invisible collision around the Mega-Cannon that blocks Brigitte's Shield Bash and Whip Shot.

Is getting quintuple kills using D.Va’s Self Destruct ultimate ability the one trait your opponents fear? If you are proud of your playstyle with your favorite heroes, now you can celebrate it with Overwatch 2’s new Player Progression feature. Originally, we used experience levels to celebrate how much players advanced in Overwatch. In Overwatch 2, we want to bring different ways for players to earn rewards and show off their playstyles to their peers. Starting in Overwatch 2: Invasion, we introduced an entirely new Player Progression system to track and celebrate your playstyle with your favorite heroes, roles, and game modes. Celebrate your Playstyle and Favorite Heroes Your progress in Overwatch 2 is now looked at in three progression layers. First, sub-badges are displayed for specific statistics based on the hero, role, and game mode you play. For heroes, this tracks the key stats common to that hero’s role, time played, and games won, along with the stats surrounding their unique abilities. For roles, you’ll track common stats associated with that role, along with how many wins you earn and how much you play. Finally, with game modes, you track number of wins and time played across each mode. As you reach the threshold for each sub-badge level, you’ll level up that sub-badge, contributing XP to the badge level for that specific hero, role, or game mode. Badges reach new tiers as they level up and are a great way to show your favorite heroes, roles, or game modes. Each time one of your badges levels up, you gain a player progression level that you can show off in your career profile and other places throughout Overwatch 2 (or if you prefer, you can turn off showing your badges and progression in your social options). As you play, your Progression Showcase will become more decorated with higher-ranked badges and sub-badges that you can screenshot and share with your friends or on social. Badges will be displayed in places that show off the heroes you play, such as the Play of the Game highlight. Your player progression level will also proudly be displayed in the overview of your career profile as well. Also, be sure to enable your Career Profile to public view if you want to show off your achievements to any players you encounter! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/5066ea2929041de9788b78dc8013edce342b7bdc.png Introducing New Challenges As you level up your badges and progression levels for each hero, you’ll be able to complete new hero challenges and earn Player Icons, Name Cards, and Titles. There is also a new weekly challenge with Player Progression. Once you level up your Player Progression enough, you’ll earn bonus Overwatch Credits that can be spent in the Hero Gallery for Overwatch cosmetics. It will also count toward the three weekly reward challenge tiers that grant Overwatch Coins to spend for premium Overwatch 2 cosmetics in the in-game shop. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/386c29eb3d523423ee782818727d9f2e8351b3d5.png Show Off Your Achievements!

        "contents": "Overwatch 2: Invasion launched last week, and it was our biggest season launch ever! The release included work from every section of the Overwatch team, and we’ve been looking forward to sharing what we built with all of you for a long time. We made big additions to the Core PvP game and other features, a new Battle Pass, and a Null Sector theme that we received great feedback early on. We also launched the first chapter of our Story Missions and ran a Co-op event alongside their release. We've heard from many of our core players that the game is in the best state it's ever been, and many have told us that it feels like we're really listening to their feedback and that this season is a culmination of that. It’s so awesome to hear. Illari, our newest support hero, was introduced this season. Players have given us a lot of positive feedback about her. Our balance goal for the release of Illari was to make sure that she felt strong (but not overpowered!) at launch.  I think we hit that goal. Illari is very strong, but some of what helps Illari not feel overpowered is her Support role and kit. Were we to release a Damage hero with a one-shot ability, we would be a little more careful with their power level. Illari will enter our Ranked mode on Thursday, August 24, and we will be making a few adjustments to her by then - most likely to her Healing Pylon and Ultimate. We also released a new game mode, Flashpoint, with two unique maps this season. While there’s been a lot of talk about Illari and other parts of Overwatch 2: Invasion, we're seeing lower conversation around this mode. Players are busy with the new hero and everything else released this season, so it’s understandable… but we still want the mode to be as good as possible! So let us have it. We’d like to know what people like and dislike with Flashpoint so that we can iterate on it. We’re also talking about when to bring Flashpoint to Ranked. Barring any bugs or exploits, we'd like to start Ranked matches sooner rather than later. A big part of this season was the release of our first set of Story Missions, which has seen more discussion than any other part of the season. Some of the discussion has been critical, and I’ll get to that, but one of the things that I loved seeing was the Legendary runs that people were streaming online. These missions on Legendary are hard. Super hard. Most people can't complete them at this difficulty, and those that did had to devise custom strategies and team comps to get past the hardest encounters. If you’re a content creator who completed Legendary and you’re reading this post, pat yourself on the back. You were great entertainment!  Only 1.6% of attempts successfully completed Gothenburg on Legendary, and 0.7% of attempts on Toronto were successful! We feel like we learned something with the level of difficulty and are excited to apply and expand on it for future Co-op content. We also launched on Steam last week, and, although being review-bombed isn't a fun experience, it's been great to see lots of new players jump into Overwatch 2 for the first time. Our goal with Overwatch 2 has been to make the game more accessible than ever for more people than ever before. Many of the reviews on Steam mention the cancellation of the much larger component of PvE that was announced in 2019 as one of their primary reasons for dissatisfaction with the game. I get that. That announcement was about an ambitious project that we ultimately couldn't deliver.  If we can’t turn back the clock, then what can we do? We can keep adding to and improving Overwatch 2. That is how we move forward. This means more maps, heroes, game modes, missions, stories, events, cool cosmetics, and features - an ever-expanding, evolving, and improving game. This is the future of Overwatch. One where we will continually create and innovate on what is making the game great now for the players who are playing now. Overwatch is such a unique game and world. When our heroes are all working together to complete an objective, there is really nothing else like it. Jump in--there's more to come! As always, thanks for reading, and I'll see you in-game. ",

        "contents": "Overwatch 2: Invasion is here, and packed with a new hero, a new seasonal Battle Pass, and a new core PvP game mode. We’re also bringing new Invasion Story Missions, a limited-time Co-op Event, and new ways to practice and celebrate your achievements with your favorite heroes. Let’s check out everything that you can expect in the new update! Introducing new Support hero Illari {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/3324d19e116e5255eaa25669db70fb8a18a18b3a.png Illari is the newest Support Hero to join the ranks in Overwatch 2. What sets Illari apart from other Support heroes is that she has a very damage-focused kit, so that you can heal your team while dominating the opposition. Her Solar Rifle fires a beam of sunlight that can do powerful burst damage at long-range, or use it to heal allies around you. She can also support her team with a deployable Healing Pylon, granting bursts of health to allies around it. Her Outburst ability will knock enemies back and propel herself out of danger. When you need to turn up the heat, use Captive Sun and fire a massive ball of solar energy. Opponents hit by this ultimate ability will be Sun Struck, making them vulnerable to lethal explosions if they take too much damage. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/d83787b0d47b4cbbb3de998e5082cfc6c4cdb6e7.png Unlock Illari immediately when you get the Premium Battle Pass, or wait to unlock her on tier 45 for free. You can also unlock Illari—and all the heroes in Overwatch—with the new Overwatch 2 Complete Hero Collection, now available in the In-Game Shop. Invasion Story Missions – The next chapter in the Overwatch 2 story {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/1a86b8b76f5cd4edaa2a67aac61dac172c86cfed.png A global invasion has begun, and it’s up to you to answer the call, with Invasion Story Missions! The rogue Omnic group, Null Sector, has begun attacking Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Gothenburg, using powerful war bots to defeat anything that stands in their way. Winston and his Overwatch strike team are on a mission to stop Null Sector, and they'll need to rely on allies - old and new - to get the job done. Invasion Story Missions are deep and expansive co-op experiences where a team of four players will work to complete multiple mission objectives across massive maps. You won’t find this kind of teamwork in traditional PvP play. The heroes choices are custom selected for each particular Story Mission as well, and you can challenge yourself with four different levels of difficulty. Get started today with the Overwatch 2: Invasion Bundle, which grants permanent access to the Invasion Story Missions and 1,000 Overwatch Coins, which can be used to purchase the Invasion Premium Battle Pass or more cosmetics for your favorite heroes. Once you complete all Invasion Story Missions, you’ll also unlock the Vigilante Legendary skin and permanent access to Sojourn as a playable hero in all PVP game modes. You can also upgrade to the Overwatch 2: Invasion Ultimate Bundle. This massive collection includes everything in the Overwatch 2 Invasion Bundle,  the Premium Battle Pass &20 tiers, an additional 1,000 Overwatch Coins, and two exclusive Null Sector-themed Legendary skins for Cassidy and Kiriko. Both bundles are available in our in-game shop today! Invasion Battle Pass & Ana A-7000 Wargod Mythic Skin {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/0bdf26329fcac2ad60b56bcf8641695e10527bff.png The Invasion Premium Battle Pass is packed with over 80 tiers of new rewards. Included are all-new legendary skins for Winston, Symmetra, and Zarya, up to 2,000 Overwatch Credits to unlock legacy cosmetics from the Hero Gallery, new sprays, voice lines, name cards, player icons, and more. Complete the Battle Pass, and you’ll unlock the Null Sector-themed A-7000 Mythic Skin for Ana, which transforms sharpshooting support hero into an advanced Null Sector combat bot. New Event – King’s Row: Underworld {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/1727d3c2e3c3d3212e440e9647389f1436e242db.png Starting today, you can team up in an exciting limited-time co-op event that will further test your skills against the forces of Null Sector. King’s Row is under siege, and you will need to work together with your friends to save the Omnics trapped in the Underworld before Null Sector can get to them. You’ll explore all new parts of the King’s Row map as you work to bring a combat-modified TS-1 push bot online and then escort it to defeat the enemy forces that stand in your way. This free-to-play co-op event will also have new challenges every week for you to test your skills and earn new rewards. Play King’s Row: Underworld today through September 4. Take part in non-stop brawls with the new core PvP mode, Flashpoint Introducing Flashpoint - a brand-new core game mode, which takes a lot of the fun mechanics of our other modes and creates a whole new PvP experience. Randomized control points, called Flashpoints, unlock different and unique strategies. Each time a Flashpoint is captured, the next immediately unlocks for non-stop action. Capture three before your opponents, and you’ll win the match! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/55f65b838d9730d33f3da83edbed459b43159ca1.png Flashpoint is hosted on two brand new maps, Suravasa and New Junk City. The maps are the largest we’ve built for PvP gameplay and offer tons of striking visuals and nods to Overwatch’s history. Suravasa in India is an exotic cityscape with gardens, fountains, and lagoons, and you’ll recognize the map’s connections to our existing lore with Zenyatta and Symmetra. New Junk City, the heart of the Junker’s domain in Australia, goes beyond the gates of Junkertown, where you’ll explore new battle arenas and the salvaged Omnium that the Junkers call home. Flashpoint is available in Quick Play and can be played exclusively in a limited-time arcade mode starting today. It will be added to the Competitive map pool later once you’ve had a chance to familiarize themselves with its nuances. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44392706/1dc36f3e02c1bdfe927ad9a87c11f9b33fbea389.png Also new to Overwatch 2: Invasion We’re excited to bring a whole new Player Progression system to Overwatch 2. This new player progression system will be able to track your progress and achievements with specific heroes, roles, and game modes, earning all-new badges that celebrate those achievements that will appear with your hero portrait and BattleTag throughout the game. In addition, you’ll also unlock new rewards, including hero-themed player icons, name cards, and titles that celebrate your progress as a player with your favorite heroes. We’ve also made new updates to our practice range including all-new practice bots and a new firing range to test your skills with heroes you already play or new ones you want to learn with. Pick from targets or bots, and adjust the distance of your targets and how they move for full skill tests. This latest update also brings a variety of new hero balance updates to PVP. Notable changes include improving Bastion’s Tactical Grenade to have more impact and shifting the power in Kiriko’s Kunai and Protection Suzu. You can read up on these changes and more in the latest patch notes and learn more about context behind some of the changes from game director Aaron Keller’s latest blog. Overwatch 2: Invasion is now live and available for major platforms. Answer the call and save the world today!",

Enjoy the new Invasion Story Missions, all-new skins, and cosmetic rewards in the Invasion Battle Pass, the new core PVP game mode Flashpoint, and the new Support Hero Illari! Introducing Illari Using solar threading augmentation, Illari strikes down her enemies by harnessing the power of the sun. Illari has been added to the line-up. Solar Rifle (Primary Fire) Long-range auto-charging rifle. Solar Rifle (Secondary Fire) Medium-range healing beam that consumes solar energy. Outburst (Ability 1) Launches you in the direction you are moving, knocking back enemies. Hold jump to go higher. Healing Pylon (Ability 2) Deploy a pylon that heals allies. Captive Sun (Ultimate) Fire an explosive ball of solar energy. Enemies hit are slowed and explode after taking significant damage. New Game Mode - Flashpoint Flashpoint is the newest core game mode available on two of the biggest maps to date: Suravasa and New Junk City. Gameplay begins with both teams pursuing a central objective called a Flashpoint, aiming to capture it before the opposing team does. Capture progress for Flashpoint is like the Control game mode, but plays out faster. A point is captured by a team once a Flashpoint reaches 100% capture progress. If the Flashpoint is being contested by a member of the opposite team currently not in control when the capture progress reaches 99%, Overtime will activate until either the team in control can remove all remaining opponents off, or until the contesting team can retake control of the Flashpoint. A point is scored when a Flashpoint is fully captured by a team, however, gameplay continues when a new Flashpoint located somewhere else on the map is activated, and both teams must immediately race to capture it. As additional Flashpoints unlock, the spawn locations of each team will be of generally equal distance to the currently activated Flashpoint. The team to be the first to successfully capture three of the five flashpoints wins the match. Flashpoint is available now in Unranked modes and will be available for Competitive Play later this season. Invasion Story Missions Players who purchase the Invasion Bundle from the in-game shop can play in all-new Story Missions with their friends or others in queue. These massive co-op experiences will have players face against the invading forces of Null Sector, who have launched an all-out global offensive. Play through all of them and unlock the Overwatch 2 hero Sojourn, along with her new Vigilante Legendary skin. Players can access the Story Missions can be accessed through Winston’s Desk in the Missions card in the play menu, where players can explore the Story Missions hub and new Intel Database. Playing missions and completing various goals will unlock lore entries, movies, never-before-revealed details about your favorite heroes and characters, and clues about the future of the world of Overwatch! New Limited Time Event: King’s Row – Underworld Stop Null Sector from taking over the Omnic Underworld in this new co-op event that's free to play for everyone! Reactivate a combat modified TS-1 Utility Bot to aid in liberating endangered omnics, but be warned: massive amounts of Null Sector forces have occupied King's Row. And that's not all—a  powerful new support unit will be healing the deadly OR-14 attack bot in your path. Every week, we'll be adding new challenges and ways to play this new co-op event. Keep checking back! The King’s Row – Underworld event runs from August 10 to September 5. General Updates Firing Range Train your aim with an all-new addition to the Practice Range! Use targets large and small, stationary and mobile, to perfect your crosshair tracking skills. Rack up points and strive to set the high score! Challenges Added a new Weekly challenge: Making Progress - Earn 8 Progression Levels. Instead of rewarding additional Battle Pass XP, this challenge rewards 150 Overwatch Credits to buy items from the Hero Gallery and counts as a challenge to earn Overwatch Coins when you complete multiple weekly challenges. Weekly Overwatch Coins reward requirements are updated from 4/8/11 to 4/9/12. Added a new set of challenges for the \"Invasion\" story missions. They can be found under the Lifetime tab. Added Player Progression challenges for all 38 heroes. Player Icons can now be earned through these challenges. Added Gold player title rewards to Competitive challenges. Developer Comments: We've adjusted the second and third tiers to 9 and 12, but expect players to complete \"Making Progress\" on their way to those thresholds, which should leave the difficulty to complete weekly challenges unchanged. We've kept the first tier requirement at 4, which should be easier to earn with the introduction of the new weekly challenge. On Fire Increased minimum Blazing time to 10 seconds. Added a 3-second cooldown to Blazing to prevent the sound effect from playing too frequently. The visual effects for Blazing have been enhanced. Ping system Changed Symmetra's personal Teleporter pings to work like Illari's personal Healing Pylon pings so that the waypoint UI is removed when these objects are pinged. Fixed Lifeweaver pinging enemy Petal Platforms as if they belong to him. Health Packs are now pingable. Text Chat Change The ‘Unfiltered’ setting for all text chat channels has been removed. Players will have a choice on their chat settings between Friendly and Mature. Players that had previously set Text Profanity Filters to Unfiltered will now have applicable filters set to Mature. Regardless of text chat filter settings, please continue to report those using inappropriate chat using the in-game report tool.Competitive Play Updates Top 500 Leaderboards The number of wins required to appear on the Top 500 Leaderboard has been increased from 25 to 50 for consistency with our other Competitive game modes.Hero Updates Armor health damage reduction is now additive with other sources of damage reduction and has a maximum cap of 50%. Developer Comments: Armor damage reduction was multiplicative with damage reduction from abilities, creating situations where certain heroes were much more difficult to damage than intended, since they were bypassing the damage reduction cap. This change will smooth out some of the extreme spikes in survivability. Tank D.Va Boosters Cooldown reduced from 4 to 3.5 seconds. Eject Mech Pilot is now damage immune for 0.4 seconds while ejecting. Developer Comments: Once D.Va’s mech was destroyed, there was a window of time where the pilot could be damaged or killed before the player fully had control over their character. With this change, D.Va can no longer be damaged by things like explosions or melee attacks before the player fully transitions control from the mech to the pilot. Doomfist Seismic Slam Cooldown reduced from 7 to 6 seconds. Power Block Now reduces damage from stuck projectiles. Developer Comments: Doomfist is performing well overall but tends to have more deaths on average compared to other Tank heroes. Lowering the Seismic Slam cooldown will reduce downtime in his ability rotations and translate into more survivability due to the increased mobility and potential for generating overhealth more often with his passive ability. Additionally, Power Block will now always reduce explosive damage from a projectile stuck directly to Doomfist, even though normally you have to face the direction of the incoming damage to block it. Orisa Fusion Driver Damage falloff range increased from 15 to 20 meters. Fortify Fortify health bonus increased from 75 to 125. Developer Comments: Fortify is sometimes weaker now due to the change to how armor damage reduction and ability damage reduction interact. Activating Fortify while Orisa has armor health remaining will hit the damage reduction cap and result in lower effective health than before, so we are increasing the amount of overhealth it grants. In addition, we are also increasing the Fusion Driver’s effective range so Orisa can deal a little more damage before engaging at close quarters. Ramattra Nemesis – Block Block now reduces damage from stuck projectiles. Annihilation Ultimate cost increased 12%. Block now reduces damage from stuck projectiles. Developer Comments: Similar to Doomfist’s Power Block change, Ramattra’s Block ability will now always apply damage reduction to projectiles stuck directly to him. His Annihilation ultimate ability was being generated slightly too quickly for how impactful it can be, so we are increasing its ultimate cost. Sigma General Base movement ground deceleration increased to match standard heroes movement. Developer Comments: Sigma has always had somewhat floatier movement controls than most heroes in order to match his character movement animations. However, this led players to feel like his Tank role passive ability wasn’t reducing the amount he would be knocked back since it took him longer to stop than other tanks. We’ve now adjusted this to the standard hero movement values to make the gameplay interactions feel more consistent. Winston Tesla Cannon Secondary fire charge time reduced from 1.2 to 1 second. Secondary fire recovery time increased from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds. Developer Comments: Winston’s Tesla Cannon ranged attack had a decently long charge time relative to the damage it deals. These adjustments will make it more responsive to charge and fire, which can be useful for situations such as finishing off low health enemies attempting to flee, or poking at enemies before leaping in. This comes at the cost of taking a longer time to recover after firing, which in some cases will be weaker as a burst-damage combo with Jump Pack and primary fire. Damage Bastion A-36 Tactical Grenade Maximum explosion damage falloff reduced from 70% to 50%. Detonation time reduced from 0.5 to 0.35 seconds. Recoil adjusted to recover more quickly. Projectile size increased from 0.2 to 0.25. Impact damage increased from 15 to 30. Configuration Recon Reload time reduced from 1.5 to 1.2 seconds. Configuration Assault Transforming into Configuration Assault now repairs 50 armor health. Configuration Artillery Targeting state movement speed increased from 20 to 25 meters per second. Developer Comments: There are several small tuning adjustments to Bastion here with the goal of improving overall effectiveness, as Bastion’s weakness of being a large and immobile target has proven tough to overcome, even with such powerful damage potential. Cassidy General Base health increased from 200 to 225. Peacekeeper Peacekeeper damage falloff range rescaled from 25-45 meters to 25-35 meters. Magnetic Grenade Projectile now has a maximum travel time of 1.5 seconds. Slow amount reduced from 30 to 25%. Developer Comments: Even with the powerful and reworked Magnetic Grenade, Cassidy has still been underperforming, so we are reverting his maximum health back up to 225, having his gun damage falloff reach its full reduction sooner, and restricting the maximum range on magnetic grenade to help solidify his position as a close-to-mid range damage dealer. Hanzo Storm Bow Arrow draw progress is no longer preserved while wall climbing. Developer Comments: Despite being conceptually strange, this gameplay mechanic felt good and fluid to use as Hanzo. However, it often resulted in some frustrating behavior for enemy players that can be alleviated without impacting Hanzo’s overall effectiveness too significantly. Sombra EMP Ultimate cost increased 15%. No longer destroys Lifeweaver's Tree of Life. Developer Comments: EMP frequency is a little too high given its relative power so we are increasing its cost. It will now also deal the usual percentage of max health damage to Lifeweaver’s Tree of Life ultimate instead of treating it like a barrier and destroying it instantly. Soldier: 76 Helix Rocket Explosion damage reduced from 90 to 80. Tactical Visor Ultimate cost increased 10%. Developer Comments: Soldier: 76 became much more deadly after his last round of changes so we are reverting the Helix Rocket explosion damage to lower his burst damage. We are also increasing his Tactical Visor ultimate cost to help account for his overall increased damage output, both during the ultimate and leading up to it. Torbjörn General Weapon swap time reduced from 0.5 to 0.4 seconds. Rivet Gun Primary fire recovery time reduced from 0.55 to 0.48 seconds. Forge Hammer Swing recovery time reduced from 0.75 to 0.6 seconds. Developer Comments: We are continuing to add power into the Rivet Gun, as the previous changes didn’t quite make up for the turret damage decrease. In addition, we are also improving the Forge Hammer swing speed so that it is more effective to repair a turret while it is under fire. Support Ana Biotic Rifle Damage and healing per projectile reduced from 75 to 70. Unscoped projectile size increased from 0 to 0.1. Developer Comment: Ana's damage breakpoint change has proven too effective overall given her long range so we are reverting it back to its previous value. We are also increasing the size of unscoped projectiles when firing at enemies (her projectiles have always had a larger size for allies) which should help them land more consistently against close-ranged threats. Brigitte Barrier Shield Barrier Shield health reduced from 300 to 250. Rally Ultimate cost increased 6%. Developer Comment: Brigitte's overall effectiveness and survivability have been high relative to other heroes, so we are reducing the Barrier Shield health. We’re also slightly adjusting the ultimate cost of Rally, as it has become more effective after its rework. Kiriko Protection Suzu Knockback removed. Healing reduced from 50 to 40. Now heals for an additional 30 health when cleansing a negative effect. Kunai Damage increased from 40 to 45. Recovery time reduced from 0.55 to 0.5 seconds. Critical damage multiplier reduced from 3 to 2.5x. Developer Comment: Protection Suzu now rewards more deliberate usage by increasing its healing when cleansing negative effects. It will no longer knockback enemies, as it wasn't particularly important to its overall design and was there to provide feedback for the impact. These Kunai changes will make the weapon damage output more consistent and reduce some of the disparity between landing critical hits or not. Lifeweaver General Base health reduced from 200 to 175. Base shield health increased from 0 to 50. Thorn Valley Reduced spread for one of the two Thorn Volley projectiles fired per shot by 25%. Rejuvenating Dash Healing increased from 25 to 50. Life Grip Mobility lockout duration increased from 0.45 to 0.75 seconds. Tree of Life 50% of Tree of Life’s overhealing is now converted into Overhealth – up to 100 maximum Overhealth. Developer Comments: The Tree of Life outputs substantial healing but often doesn't provide enough value for an ultimate ability. To increase its utility, any overhealing done via the Tree is now converted to overhealth. Thorn Volley's spread is now less random, with half the projectiles having a smaller base spread to promote better mid-range consistency. Life Grip now has a longer mobility lockout duration to prevent accidental cancels by the affected ally using a movement ability immediately after the pull being started. Finally, we are supplementing Lifeweaver's survivability with an increase to his overall health pool by converting some of it to shield health in order to account for the large petal hit volume on his back, as well as increasing the healing done by Rejuvenating Dash. Lúcio Crossfade Self-healing penalty is now reduced from 60 to 0% for the duration of Amp It Up. Developer Comment: In order to help bring Lucio’s survivability more in line with the rest of the Support heroes, Crossfade self-healing during Amp It Up is now a more effective survival option for Lucio. Mercy Caduceus Staff Secondary fire damage boost reduced from 30 to 25%. Developer Comment: Damage amplification effects have been an often discussed topic lately and Mercy has been performing strongly at all skill ranks. We’re reducing the potency of Mercy’s damage boost beam but want to make sure it stays powerful enough to feel like an effective and interesting gameplay choice, as making the decision between healing or damage boosting is core to Mercy’s gameplay. CO-OP MODE HERO UPDATES With the introduction of Overwatch 2: Invasion Story Missions, we will have specific hero balance changes for multiple heroes to ensure players have a continuous challenge when playing in co-op modes like Story Missions and Event Missions. Heroes no longer passively gain ultimate charge over time. Ultimate costs increased in co-op game modes.

        "contents": "As Blizzard evolves as a studio, inside and out, one of the ideas pushing us forward is meeting players around the world where they are and making our games as easy as possible to access and play. We want to give everyone a chance to experience our universes with old friends while making new ones, no matter how they choose to play. Battle.net is the home of all our PC players, and over the years, we’ve evolved our platform to support updated technologies, capabilities, and our communities’ expectations. But as we’ve evolved, the industry has evolved too–gaming is no longer just for specific communities as it was when Battle.net launched over two decades ago, gaming is for everyone–and though we remain committed to continually investing in and supporting Battle.net, we want to break down the barriers to make it easier for players everywhere to find and enjoy our games. Which is why we’re trying something new. We’re excited to announce that we are bringing a selection of our games to Steam, starting with Overwatch 2… which will be available on the platform on August 10! “It’s our goal at Blizzard to listen to players and try to exceed their expectations in everything we do,” said Mike Ybarra, President of Blizzard Entertainment. “While Battle.net remains a priority for us now and into the future, we’ve heard players want the choice of Steam for a selection of our games, starting with Overwatch 2 on August 10th. We’re happy to work with Valve to make that happen.” \"Gamers and developers are both going to benefit from Overwatch 2 coming to Steam,\" said Gabe Newell, Valve's president. \"Gamers will have another platform where they can play a beloved game that utilizes the capabilities of Steam, and developers will benefit from the effects of having the talented team at Blizzard helping us evolve our supported features and functionality for Overwatch 2.\" As a free-to-play, team-based game, we believe Overwatch 2 is the perfect title for Blizzard’s debut on the platform. Overwatch 2: Invasion is launching with more new types of gameplay experiences than at any point in the game’s storied 7-year history, including the first-ever set of PvE Story Missions, a new core PvP game mode with two new maps, and of course, a new hero. It’s a great opportunity for new players to enjoy their first experience of the Overwatch universe. Overwatch 2’s presence on Steam is in addition to Battle.net, so the incredible community already accessing the game through Battle.net can play as they have with no changes required. Players on Steam will still need to connect Overwatch 2 to a Battle.net account, as we require for all platforms, which enables cross-platform play and more. Players using Steam will have access to features of the platform while playing Overwatch 2, such as Steam achievements, their Steam friends list, and the ability to invite them to play in-game. We’re excited to see the response from the Overwatch community–both veteran players and new ones who come on board through Steam–and we’re looking forward to hearing their feedback. As far as what’s next for Blizzard on Steam, we’ll be sharing more about potential other games coming to the platform when the time is right. Overwatch 2 is now available to wishlist on Steam! We invite the Overwatch community to give their new teammates playing from Steam a warm welcome on August 10! To stay up to date with everything Blizzard, be sure to follow us on Twitter.",
